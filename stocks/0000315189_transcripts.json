John Deere completed the third quarter with disciplined performance amid a tough macro backdrop. Financial results for the quarter included an 18.5% margin for the equipment operations. Ag fundamentals remain muted and market demand and construction and forestry has tempered alongside continued price competition, resulting in another quarter of overall challenging market conditions.\nDespite tougher markets in both ag and construction, we continue to execute to our plan, focusing on proactive inventory and cost management, notably for the quarter, we adjusted rest-of-year production schedules in our earthmoving product lines to target lower year-end field inventory levels. As a result, order books across all segments are effectively full for the remainder of the fiscal year as we position our business to respond to changes in retail demand.\nThese actions along with a continued focus on cost control, are essential to keeping our business healthy as we continue to invest in future growth. We now begin with Slide 3 and our results for the third quarter. Net sales and revenues were down 17% to $13.152 billion, while net sales for the equipment operations were down 20% to $11.387 billion. Net income attributable to Deere & Company was $1.734 billion or $6.29 per diluted share.\nDouble-booking into our individual business segments, we'll start with Production and Precision Ag on Slide 4. Net sales of $5.099 billion were down 25% compared to the third quarter last year, primarily due to lower shipment volumes, which were partially offset by price realization. Price realization was positive by slightly more than 2.5 points. Currency translation was negative by a little more than 1 point. Operating profit was $1.162 billion, with a 22.8% operating margin for the segment.\nThe year-over-year decrease was primarily due to lower shipment volumes and employee separation program expenses. These were partially offset by price realization and lower warranty expenses. Next, we'll turn to small ag and turf on Slide 5. Net sales were down 18% year-over-year, totaling $3.053 billion in the third quarter because of lower shipment volumes, partially offset by price realization. Price realization was positive by more than 1.5 points. Currency translation was negative by just under 0.5 point.\nOperating profit declined year-over-year to $496 million, leading to a 16.2% operating margin. The decrease was primarily due to lower shipment volumes and higher warranty expenses, which were partially offset by price realization. Slide 6 gives our 2024 industry outlook for ag and turf markets globally. Across all major markets, we continue to see muted demand resulting from a challenging macro environment. Global stocks of grains continue to rebuild with excellent growing conditions leading to better-than-expected production and lower commodity prices. High interest rates and geopolitical uncertainty, further way on customers' purchase decisions, resulting in reduced demand across all end markets.\nIn the U.S. and Canada, we continue to expect large ag equipment industry sales to be down approximately 15% during the quarter. Demand continues to be pressured by declining farm margins and elevated used inventory levels in late model year machines, which is partially offset by an elevated fleet age, rising farmland values and stable farm balance sheet. Within small ag and turf in the U.S. and Canada, Industry demand estimates remain down approximately 10%.\nFurther declines in the turf and compact utility tractor segments, which are more sensitive to interest rates are partially offset by improving dairy and livestock fundamentals.\nTurning to Europe. The industry is forecasted to be down approximately 15%, reflecting yield headwinds and weakened margins. Volatile weather patterns continued to drive commodity price and arable cash flow uncertainty which is enhanced by slightly elevated input costs. However, dairy and livestock fundamentals remain healthy, providing moderate stability to the segment.\nIn South America, we expect industry sales of tractors and combines to decline between 15% and 20%. Commodity price softening and elevated interest rates continued to pressure grow profitability, especially in Brazil, our largest market in the region. Fundamentals are further pressured by better-than-expected production in Brazil despite regional weather challenges and a slower-than-forecasted recovery in Argentina. Industry sales in Asia are forecasted down moderately.\nMoving on to our segment forecast beginning on Slide 7. Production in Precision Ag, our net sales forecast remains down between 20% and 25% for the full year. The forecast now assumes roughly 2 points of positive price realization and flat currency translation for the full year. The segment's operating margin, our full year forecast remains between 20.5% and 21.5% despite muted demand.\nSlide 8 covers our forecast for the small ag and turf segment. We expect net sales to remain down between 20% and 25%. The guide now includes 2 points of positive price realization and flat currency translation. The segment's operating margin continues to be forecasted between 13.5% and 14.5%, in line with slowing net sales.\nShifting now to Construction & Forestry on Slide 9. Net sales for the quarter were down 13% year-over-year to $3.235 billion due to lower shipment volumes. Price realization was negative by 1 point. Currency translation was also negative by more than 0.5 point. Operating profit of $448 million was down year-over-year, resulting in a 13.8% operating margin due primarily to lower shipment volumes, unfavorable sales mix and negative price realization.\nSlide 10 provides an update to our 2024 Construction & Forestry industry outlook. Industry sales for earthmoving equipment in the U.S. and Canada is now expected to be down 5% to 10%, while compact construction equipment in the U.S. and Canada is now expected to be flat to down 5%. Demand for earthmoving and compact construction equipment is down from robust levels in 2023 and increasingly competitive as rental refleeting decelerates and used inventory levels rise.\nWhile U.S. government infrastructure spending remains supportive and manufacturing investments continue to increase, we are witnessing a sequential slowdown in single-family housing starts amid interest rate uncertainty. This is compounded by continued declines in multifamily housing starts and persistent weakness in the commercial real estate sector. Global forestry markets are projected to remain down around 10% as all global markets continue to be challenged.\nThe global world building market forecast remains flat to down 5 as strong infrastructure spending in the U.S. is offset by continued softness in Western Europe. Moving on to Construction & Forestry segment outlook on Slide 11. 2024 net sales estimates are now expected to be down between 10% and 15% as moderating demand is coupled with planned under production. Net sales guidance for the year now includes about 0.5 point of positive price realization and flat currency translation. The segment's operating margin is now projected to be around 15%, reflecting a tougher competitive environment, accelerating demand and underproduction of construction equipment.\nTransitioning to our financial services operations on Slide 12. The Worldwide Financial Services net income attributable to Deere & Company in the third quarter was $153 million. Net income was lower due to a higher provision for credit losses and less favorable financing spreads which were partially offset by a higher average portfolio and favorable discrete tax items. For fiscal year 2024, our outlook for net income is now at $720 million. as benefits from a higher average portfolio balance are expected to be more than offset by a higher provision for credit losses and less favorable financing spreads. Subsequent to the quarter, we announced an agreement with Banco Bradesco to invest and become 50% owners in our Brazilian financing subsidiary, Banco John Deere.\nThis strategic decision reduces incremental financing risks while allowing for continued investment in growth in the Brazilian market. The transaction is expected to close in the second fiscal quarter of 2025. In our quarterly results, we classified Banco John Deere as a business held for sale, which resulted in the net impact of a pretax and after-tax loss of $15 million accounted for in SA&G within the Financial Services segment.\nNext, Slide 13 outlines our guidance for Deere & Company's net income, our effective tax rate and operating cash flow. For fiscal year '24, we remain -- we maintain our outlook for net income at approximately $7 billion. Next, our guidance continues to incorporate an effective tax rate between 23% and 25%. And lastly, cash flow from the equipment operations is now projected to be in the range of $6 billion to $6.5 billion.\nAnd finally, on Slide 14, I'd like to hand it over to John May to say a few words.\n\nJohn C. May\n\nPresident-Agricultural Solutions & Chief Information Officer, Deere & Co.\n\nThank you, Josh. The third quarter was another solid quarter, thanks to the efforts of the entire John Deere team in partnership with our outstanding dealer network and supply base. As mentioned in the opening comments, our customers across nearly all business segments are facing headwinds, including softer commodity prices and elevated interest rates.\nAgainst this backdrop, I'm extremely proud of our team's unwavering commitment to and execution of our key priorities. They have navigated the business cycle through proactive inventory management and disciplined cost control, while continually striving to deliver value to our customers. Effective cycle management begins with ensuring that inventory levels are appropriately aligned to end market demand. Throughout 2024, we've prudently and proactively adjusted production schedules in our large ag business at a faster pace than ever before in order to reduce field inventory in our end markets.\nThis quarter, we made a similar adjustment for many of our earthmoving product lines in North America in response to signs of moderating demand. We will also continue to focus on reducing used inventory levels, particularly in North American large ag for the remainder of the year. As we approach the start of fiscal 2025, the leading levels of field inventory resulting from these actions will best position our operations in both segments to respond effectively to changes in market demand.\nProactively managing our production schedules also facilitates disciplined cost control. In this lower volume environment, we've made challenging decisions that impact both our factories and our offices to ensure that our cost structure aligns with current market demand. And while these actions have been hard and certainly not something we take lightly, they help us maintain our competitiveness throughout the business cycle, allowing us to continue investing in the products and solutions that empower our customers to address their unique challenges. That is our ultimate purpose, delivering value for our customers.\nIn the near term, this means continuing to build and ship the highest level quality and most productive equipment to our customers. I want to extend my heartfelt gratitude to all of our John Deere team members who have maintained this commitment at the highest level throughout 2024 despite necessary adjustments we've had to make in our operations.\nNone of this happens without a high-performing team that shows up to deliver for our customers every single day. In the medium and long term, our ability to deliver value for our customers is rooted in Deere's unique position to help them do more with less by developing precision solutions that leverage our extensive product portfolio, our vertically integrated tech stack and unparalleled service and support.\nLooking ahead, we are optimistic about the opportunities before us. Our machines are delivering ever greater cost savings and promoting sustainable operations for our customers. We see significant potential to leverage our existing technologies across various production systems, enabling us to scale innovation and enhance value delivery across our customer base. Ultimately, this results in a continually expanding offering of solutions that drive improved outcomes for our customers, dealers and Deere alike\n\nUnknown Executive\n\nThank you, John. This concludes our formal comments. We'll now shift to discussions on a few topics specific to the quarter. Starting off with Deere's performance in the third quarter, net sales declined approximately 20% year-over-year. but we still saw our operating margin come in at over 18%. Clearly, a challenging macro environment. But we've managed to hold margins. Josh Beal can you [indiscernible] off with what happened this quarter?\n\nJosh Beal\n\nDirector of Investor Relations\n\nAbsolutely. Thanks, Josh. As you mentioned, our strong margin performance is encouraging given the difficult market backdrop, particularly as we pull the inventory management levers that John noted. In both ag segments, we saw declines in net sales as end-user demand continue to soften. However, by keeping inventories in check, we've been able to maintain solid price realization. In addition, our strategic partnerships with our supply base are helping drive down material and freight costs which are offsetting overhead efficiencies as we bring down production rates at our factories.\nIn construction, we saw a downshift in demand and an uptick in used inventories as rental refleeting cooled and home starts slow to meet interest rate uncertainty, all while a competitive market environment drove increased incentive spending. This put pressure on both volumes and price in the quarter. And as a result, we adjusted our North American construction equipment production schedule for the rest of the year to lower our ending field inventories and better position us for 2025. And with roughly 2 months of order visibility in this segment, we are confident in our ability to execute our plan.\n\nJosh Rohleder\n\nGreat recap, Josh. On you note about the challenging quarter and decline in demand. Farm fundamentals are clearly top of mind right now with corn, soy and wheat prices, all down more than 15% year-over-year, which brings down farm margins as well. Can you walk us through what we're seeing and what this means for both farmers and equipment demand?\n\nJosh Beal\n\nDirector of Investor Relations\n\nSure. It's definitely a different and tougher environment today than it was a year ago. if you take North America as an example, on the one hand, farmers are experiencing 1 of their best crops in years, thanks to excellent weather conditions. But then on the other hand, the high levels of production resulting from these strong expected yields are causing crop prices to decline, as you mentioned. Although input costs are projected to be down this year, it's not enough to offset the lower commodity prices. The need to projected year-over-year declines in farm net incomes, which ultimately puts pressure on equipment demand.\nBrazil is experiencing a similar situation in North America with ag commodity prices softening due to replenish global supplies, another year of near record yields and expansion of soybean acreage. Muted profitability for Brazilian customers is magnified by persistently high interest rates in the region, leading to further pullbacks in equipment sales. In Europe, farm investments continue to soften as weather uncertainty pressures crop yield estimates. And while living conditions remain tight, input costs have remained elevated in the region, leading to depressed margins and weaker farmer sentiment. However, steady prices and reduced input costs in the dairy and livestock segment are providing some moderating tailwinds and what is otherwise a challenging equipment demand environment in the region?\n\nUnknown Executive\n\nThis is Jeff. One important note regarding fleet fundamentals that North America, we continue to see an elevated fleet age, which enables replacement purchases. Additionally, strong balance sheets are providing support in a downturn, driven by farm land values that are up nearly 5% year-over-year. So while it's definitely a challenging market for customers, there are some supportive factors to account for.\n\nJohn C. May\n\nPresident-Agricultural Solutions & Chief Information Officer, Deere & Co.\n\nYes. This is John. I'd like to share an additional thought. Last week, I was in Brazil speaking with some of our customers in the region about the near- and long-term prospects for agriculture in the country. The near term, while the market has experienced a decline, it appears to be more stable now than it was just a few months ago, which is encouraging for 2025. Looking ahead, there is a strong sense of optimism regarding the region's prospects with significant opportunities still on the horizon. One customer mentioned that his business has structurally improved over the years. He is eager to continue investing in solutions and technologies that enhance productivity and profitability. Deere is committed to supporting this need through ongoing investments in the region as we continue to introduce new product and technologies specifically designed in Brazil for Brazil.\n\nJosh Rohleder\n\nPerfect. Now with that context on ag fundamentals, I'd like to move on to our early order programs in North America to better understand how this is translating into equipment sales for model year '25. Luke, our EOPs typically account for roughly 90% of our production for seasonal products each year. Can you walk us through what's transpired so far as we begin to get some insights into next year? .\n\nUnknown Executive\n\nAbsolutely, Josh. It's probably best to start with what's changed in our process year-over-year.\nHistorically, our early order programs would leverage multiple phases to help shape demand and fill our production schedule. Under this approach, generally speaking, the earlier an order is placed in the program, the greater the discount for the customer. During the last few years of constrained supply, this all changed, and we leverage more of an allocation approach and attempt to meet our dealer and customer needs in a time of high demand. Given the return to more moderated demand, we have returned to our traditional approach of multiple phases with tiered discounts for products like planners, air seaters, sprayers and [indiscernible]. Planters and sprayers opened earlier this summer and are currently in their second or third phase, while combines just opened last week with list price increases across all EOPs currently in the 2% to 3% range. .\n[indiscernible], as a reminder, are on a rolling order book with roughly 4 months of visibility, providing confidence in our production plans as we close out [indiscernible]. Now as we shift and talk about progress on our early order programs, coming off last year's near peak demand levels, the model year '25 sprayer EOP is currently down double digits. That said, orders are tracking slightly above pre-2022 EOP volumes.\n[indiscernible] sales are also down double digits and down relatively more than sprayers on a year-over-year. It's worth noting that historically, we have seen greater variability with implement sales throughout the ag cycle when compared to self-propelled product. And given North American planners were another product, well above mid-cycle volumes in 2024, it is not unexpected to see a larger reduction of planners relative to sprayers this year.\nAdditionally, history would tell us that in times of uncertainty, we typically see more activity at the end of the EOP phases compared to the beginning as customers time their purchases to better align delivery with their seasonals.\nThe current high interest rate environment further extends this trend as both customers and dealers look to minimize carrying costs and be as efficient as possible with their assets. While planter and sprayer EOP orders are down for model year '25, tech adoption continues to accelerate as customers adopt precision solutions to help increase profitability amidst a tougher macro environment. Across our more established solutions, we have seen average adoption rates well above 80%, and with exact supply, in particular, up nearly 10 points.\nFor our newest and most advanced offerings like Exact Shop and Sean spray, we are seeing healthy adoption rates during the first and in particular, our [indiscernible] spray technology has achieved high single-digit take rates in its first full year of commercial available at a pace commensurate with historical precedents.\n\nJoshua A. Jepsen\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Deere & Company\n\nOne thing to highlight beyond just the take rates for our latest solutions is the feedback we're receiving from both customers and dealers on the efficacy of the technology. We continue to hear that [indiscernible] savings are medium or exceeding expectations and that the ROI pencils out. That said, [indiscernible] does require significant shifts in the way our customers manage their crop care programs, everything from what chemicals they buy, to how much they buy, to how often they're tendering their equipment in the field must change, which is a significant investment on the part of the customers. We understand this, which is why we are more committed than ever to dealer engagement and customer success ensuring we provide the solutions, support, and most importantly, the outcomes that our customers need to succeed.\n\nUnknown Executive\n\nThanks for the additional detail, Josh. And Luke, if I can come back to you once more. We've covered ag fundamentals, which in turn has resulted in early indications on our [indiscernible] and sprayer EOP sales. How does this relate to inventory levels? Can you give us an update on how we're progressing in our inventory management plan?",
        "content2": "Yes, you bet. And just as a reminder, our decision to underproduce is rooted in our learnings from the last cycle. Given that, we began taking actions last year and again this year to drive inventories lower. And while this has caused some short-term pain, it is the right plan to manage the cycle and better sets us up for whichever way the market [indiscernible]. And so with that, I would start by highlighting our situation in Brazil. This market has remained challenged, as you noted earlier. However, we significantly underproduce the market and despite the industry demand declining more than anticipated, we still seen inventory decline so far this year and fully anticipate that this trend will accelerate throughout the remainder. .\nRelative to the North American large ag segment, we are beginning to see the impacts of our proactive inventory management decisions with absolute units of new inventory declining double digits over the past quarter, outpacing the industry. We expect further reductions to occur during the fourth quarter, which is in line with historical trends. And while we expect our inventory to sales ratios, which remain below industry levels to end the year at roughly the same level as last year, this reflects a material decrease in the absolute number of [indiscernible]. In fact, to put this into perspective, on an absolute basis, we are forecasting to end the year with less than 1 row crop tractor per dealer.\n\nJosh Beal\n\nDirector of Investor Relations\n\nIf I might jump in and quickly add some color to Luke's comment on rest of the year reductions in North America. The underproduction of large tractors we highlighted last quarter will be a significant driver of the implied margin decline in our fourth quarter. For example, our guide contemplates planned shutdowns of our 8 Series tractor production line in Waterloo, Iowa for about 50% of the total production days in the quarter, which will have a material impact on our decremental margins. .\nIt's important to note here that these are shutdown days rather than line rate shifts as we work to implement our planned under production for fiscal 2024 as efficiently as possible while remaining agile enough to respond to any future demand changes next year.\n\nUnknown Executive\n\nThat's a great point to highlight, Josh. And in fact, we're taking that approach at other factories around the world. For example, our 6 Series tractors in Monheim, Germany are also planning a similar shutdown for roughly 1/3 of their fourth quarter production days, which will have an impact on small ag margins as well. But to shift back to inventory levels, Luke, can you walk us through the use side.\nCertainly. On the used inventory side, we've seen total units increase across all product lines year-over-year. While combines did peak near 10-year averages last quarter, we have since seen volumes retreat as dealers work through normal intra-season swing. As we look to finish out the year and into 2025, one of our primary focused areas is [indiscernible]. To that end, last week, we hosted our dealer CEOs and key leaders at various locations across [indiscernible]. Our message to our dealers is clear, production in used inventory was our #1 priority right now, and we were further committed to helping them drive down [indiscernible].\nFurthermore, we rolled out additional programs and tactics to support them. The best example would be our increase in pool fund, which as a reminder, our dollars dealers earned from new sales that can be applied as incentives to used equipment. We expect this and other additional tactics to help them sell through late model, high horsepower tractors and combines to best position us for next year.\nOverall, as I reflect on the meetings with our dealers, I came away with a strong sense of optimism on 3 [indiscernible] points. Number one, incredibly strong alignment and focus between Deere and our dealers on managing used inventory differently from previous cycles. Two, our strategy of high-quality iron combined with world-class technology supported by the best dealers in the industry is a winning strategy that is delivering incremental value to our customers. And I heard a number of examples of this last week. And three, that despite headwinds in the industry, there is still strong support for Deere and dealers to continue to transform in areas that add significant customer value. Examples of this include even higher levels of tech utilization, along with greater investment in the tech stack and life cycle solutions.\n\nJohn C. May\n\nPresident-Agricultural Solutions & Chief Information Officer, Deere & Co.\n\nYes, this is John. I'd like to add one additional point to share. I recently spoke with one of our largest dealers in the U.S. who said, he does not expect this downturn to be as prolonged as the last cycle. He noted that the proactive steps we are taking to manage inventory are reinforcing that sentiment. As Luke mentioned, Deere in our dealer network are working together to navigate this cycle differently. We are taking action more quickly and making more aggressive decisions to ensure that inventory levels remain balanced as markets soften, and our dealers are working closely with each customer to better rationalize equipment replacement schedules this time. We fundamentally believe that these actions will lead to more favorable cycle dynamics than in previous downturns. .\n\nUnknown Executive\n\nThanks, Luke and John. That's a great summary on both the current state of the industry as well as the proactive measures we're taking to manage it.\nTurning now to Construction & Forestry. We previously mentioned some increased volatility this quarter. Josh Beal, can you further break down what's happened and what that means for the final quarter of the year?\n\nJosh Beal\n\nDirector of Investor Relations\n\nYes, definitely, Josh. This is really a story of 2 businesses, earthmoving and road building. While our roadbuilding business continues to experience more stable volumes, we've seen some hesitation in earthmoving equipment purchases. Project demand for our earthmoving customers has remained relatively unchanged. However, those same customers are seeing increased competition on their job bids as well as higher financing costs and overall higher equipment carrying costs following years -- recent years of high inflation. That means that while still profitable, many customers are experiencing lower profitability compared to just a year ago.\nAnd as a result, we are seeing some slowdown in order velocity, which is reflected in our guidance update. Additionally, rental CapEx spending has diminished with investments in construction equipment at multiyear lows following years of robust refleeting. Recall that Deere along with the industry, has been rebuilding our field inventory levels over the past several years. But the recent softening that we've seen, we are taking steps, similar to those in our Ag business, to underproduce retail demand in both our construction and compact construction equipment segments through the remainder of the year to best position ourselves for 2025.\nFrom a pricing perspective, we continue to see robust competition in the market. This, coupled with rising inventory levels has required the deployment of additional incentives into the market, resulting in net pricing declines this past quarter.\n\nJosh Rohleder\n\nGreat. Thanks, Josh. And now for a final question. This quarter included a few special items. Josh Jepsen, can you walk us through those as well as the overall state of the business before we open up the line to investors?\n\nJoshua A. Jepsen\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Deere & Company\n\nYes, absolutely, Josh. I'd like to start by echoing John's appreciation to our entire John Deere team for their adaptability and resilience to the changes in demand and their continued commitment to delivering for our customers. This quarter, we made difficult decisions to structure the business to align with current market conditions. This involved a mid-single-digit reduction in our global salaried workforce, resulting in a onetime expense of approximately $150 million for the business, $124 million of which was booked in the third quarter, while delivering roughly $230 million in run rate savings.\nThe net impact for 2024 is expected to be an expense of about $25 million. Given the velocity of the market pullback we've seen this year, this has also created volatility in our working capital. As a result, we've seen a downward revision to our operating cash flow guide However, it's important to note that there are cost management actions, whether that be our supply management teams that are driving down production costs, are focused on reducing inbound and outbound freight or engineering teams working diligently to design out costs from new equipment and retrofit solutions are yielding savings in 2024 on material and freight which gives us confidence in our ability to deliver on our net income guide of approximately $7 billion this fiscal year.\nAnd these cost management actions are an example of the many things our team is doing every day to drive a structurally better business that has capital available to invest in value-enhancing products, solutions and support to help make our customers more productive, profitable and sustainable each and every day. And as we do that, all stakeholders of John Deere will benefit.\n\nJosh Rohleder\n\nThanks, Josh. Now let's open it up to questions from our investors. Now we're ready to begin the Q&A portion of the call. The operator will extract you on the polling procedure. In consideration of others and to allow more of you to participate in the call, please limit yourself to 1 question. If you have additional questions, we ask that you rejoin the queue."

John Deere concluded the second quarter with solid execution. Financial results for the quarter included a 21.2% margin for the equipment operations. Trends in the end markets that we serve remain broadly unchanged from last quarter. Ag fundamentals continue to abate leading to more challenging market conditions in the back half of the year.\nIn construction and forestry, fundamentals remained stable at levels supportive of demand across most end markets. Demand shifts, coupled with proactive inventory management are reflected in our production schedules for the balance of the fiscal year, with many product lines anticipating retail demand under production to close out 2024. Notably, our projected financial performance in these dynamic market conditions demonstrates our ability to deliver better results across the business cycle.\nWe now begin with Slide 3 and our results for the second quarter. Net sales and revenues were down 12% to $15.235 billion, while net sales for the equipment operations were down 15% to $13.61 billion. Net income attributable to Deere & Company was $2.37 billion or $8.53 per diluted share.\nDigging into our individual business segments, we'll start with the production and precision ag business on Slide 4. Net sales of $6.581 billion were down 16% compared to the second quarter last year, primarily due to lower shipment volumes, which were partially offset by price realization. Price realization was positive by just under 2 points. Currency translation was roughly flat. Operating profit was $1.65 billion, resulting in a 25.1% operating margin for the segment. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to lower shipment volumes and higher production costs. These were partially offset by price realization.\nTurning to small ag and turf on Slide 5. Net sales were down 23%, totaling $3.185 billion in the second quarter as a result of lower shipment volumes, partially offset by price realization. Price realization was positive by 1.5 points. Currency translation was roughly flat. Operating profit declined year-over-year to $571 million, resulting in a 17.9% operating margin. The decrease was primarily due to lower shipment volumes, which were partially offset by price realization.\nSlide 6 provides our industry outlook for ag and turf markets globally. Across all our major markets, we see continued softening in grower sentiment as the combined impacts of rising global stocks, lower commodity prices, high interest rates and weather volatility weigh on customer purchase decisions. Amidst this backdrop, and rising uncertainty, we're seeing customers exercise greater discretion in their equipment purchases, which is reflected in the changes in our industry guide this quarter.\nLarge ag equipment industry sales in the U.S. and Canada are now expected to decline 15%, reflecting further demand reduction in the back half of the year, primarily in large tractors. In addition to the aforementioned factors, increases in used inventory levels, particularly late model year machines are having an impact on purchase decisions. These headwinds are partially offset by fleet fundamental tailwinds, including elevated fleet age, stable farmland values and strong pharma balance sheets.\nFor small ag and turf in the U.S. and Canada, industry demand estimates are now down 10%. In the quarter, we saw notable reductions in our expectations for the turf segment, particularly riding lawn equipment where high interest rates are impacting purchase behavior following several years of strong market demand.\nIn Europe, the industry is now forecasted to -- 15%, reflecting increasing grower uncertainty in the region. Wet conditions have raised concerns for winter crop yields, while elevated input costs are weighing on margin expectations. Despite the softening, variable cash flows remain at roughly 10-year averages, and dairy and livestock fundamentals are expected to improve due to stronger pricing amid lower feed costs.\nIn South America, industry sales of tractors and combines are now expected to decline between 15% to 20%. Brazil remains the largest affected market with additional pressure stemming from strong global yields, driving down commodity prices. Both soy and corn margin expectations softened over the quarter. Conditions are further impacted by elevated interest rates and an expected strong recovery in Argentina production levels following last year's drought.\nIndustry sales in Asia continue to be forecasted down moderately.\nNext, our segment forecast begin on Slide 7. For production and precision ag, net sales are forecasted to be down between 20% and 25% for the full year. The forecast assumes roughly 1.5 points of positive price realization for the full year and minimal currency impact. For the segment's operating margin, our full year forecast is now between 20.5% and 21.5% due to demand softening and proactive inventory management.\nSlide 8 shows our forecast for the small ag and turf segment. We now expect net sales to be down between 20% and 25%. The guide includes 1.5 points of positive price realization and flat currency translation. The segment's operating margin is now between 13.5% and 14.5%, in line with slowing net sales.\nShifting to construction and forestry on Slide 9. Net sales for the quarter were down 7% year-over-year at $3.844 billion due to lower shipment volumes. Price realization was positive by roughly 0.5 point while currency translation was flat. Operating profit of $668 million was down year-over-year, resulting in a 17.4% operating margin due primarily to lower shipment volumes and higher R&D and SA&G expenses.\nSlide 10 gives our 2024 construction and forestry industry outlook. Industry sales expectations for earthmoving equipment in the U.S. and Canada remained flat to down 5% while compact construction equipment in the U.S. and Canada is expected to be flat. Industry fundamentals remain vastly unchanged with stabilized demand supported by visibility into the balance of the year, and markets continue to be healthy as the U.S. government infrastructure spending further increases. Investments in manufacturing persist and single-family housing starts to improve. Tailwinds are tempered by declines in commercial real estate and softening in rental demand throughout the balance of the year.\nGlobal forestry markets are expected to be down around 10% as all global markets continue to be challenged. Global road building markets are now forecasted to be flat to down 5% as strong infrastructure spending in the U.S. is offset by continued softness in Western Europe.\nMoving to the construction and forestry segment outlook on Slide 11. 2024, net sales remain forecasted to be down between 5% and 10%. Net sales guidance for the year includes about 1.5 points of positive price realization and flat currency translation. The segment's operating margin is projected to be around 17%.\nTransitioning to our financial services operations on Slide 12. Worldwide financial services net income attributable to Deere & Company in the second quarter was $162 million. Net income was positively impacted by a higher average portfolio balance, which was partially offset by a higher provision for credit losses and less favorable financing spreads. As a reminder, net income in the second quarter of 2023 was also impacted by a nonrepeating onetime accounting correction.\nFor fiscal year 2024, our outlook for net income remains at $770 million as benefits from a higher average portfolio balance offset a higher provision for credit losses and less favorable financing spreads.\nFinally, Slide 13 outlines our guidance for Deere & Company's net income, our effective tax rate and operating cash flow. For fiscal year '24, our outlook for net income is now expected to be approximately $7 billion. Next, our guidance incorporates an effective tax rate between 23% and 25%. And lastly, cash flow from the equipment operations is now projected to be in the range of $7 billion to $7.25 billion.\nThis concludes our formal comments. We'll now shift to a few topics specific to the quarter. Let's begin with Deere's performance this quarter. We saw net sales decline roughly 15% year-over-year, yet operating margin came in at just over 21%. Across all business segments, we saw better-than-expected performance despite a more challenging macro backdrop.\nJosh Beal, can you walk us through what went well for Deere?\n\nJosh Beal\n\nDirector of Investor Relations\n\nYes. Absolutely, Josh. This is really a story of executional discipline across the organization. We were able to outperform on the top line as demand held up slightly better than we expected. In particular, we saw resilient earthmoving and road building market that exceeded our expectations despite a tough competitive environment.\nTurning to production costs. Freight came in solidly favorable year-over-year However, as you noted earlier, we are experiencing offsetting headwinds and overheads as we adjust production to moderating demand. All that being said, it's worth noting that this quarter's performance with equipment operations margin over 21% ranks as one of the best quarters in company history. We're encouraged by the start to the year, and we're focused on executing our plan in the remaining 2 quarters.\n\nJosh Rohleder\n\nManager of Investor Communications\n\nThanks, Josh. That's a great summary and a great point you bring up. It's clearly been a strong executional start for the year, but we've revised our full year guidance.\nWhat's driving the delta in the back half of the fiscal year?\n\nJosh Beal\n\nDirector of Investor Relations\n\nRight. The forecast change is really volume-driven, primarily in our ag and turf segments. Underlying the demand decline is a tougher backdrop in global ag, which as you mentioned in your opening comments, has continued to weigh on our customer base. Uncertainty has caused a decline in farmer sentiment. And as a result, we are seeing a softer retail environment today than we did just 6 months ago.\nPrimary crop margins globally are forecasted to be down. Feeds are expected to be above historical averages, thanks to multiple years of favorable growing conditions and record global yields, used inventories have risen and persistently high interest rates are impacting purchase decisions.\nDespite all these headwinds, we experienced strong demand in the first half of the year, albeit down from the highs of 2023, which drove solid first half production volumes for ag and turf.\nGiven the environment that I just mentioned, we do expect incremental demand decline in the back half of 2024. Notably, our production volumes will decline more than demand in the back half as we're taking proactive steps to drive down field inventories. This is true for all of our major markets, South America, Europe and also now for North America large tractors. We believe this approach best positions us to build the retail demand for '25.\n\nJoshua A. Jepsen\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Deere & Company\n\nThis is Jepsen here. Maybe a couple of things to add. First, I want to commend our employees for the work they've done to drive the overall decrementals for the business despite the velocity of declines we're experiencing this year. We're delivering value for our customers and driving operating margins that are structurally better at this point in the cycle than ever before.\nHowever, there's always opportunity to do better, and we'll continue to take action on costs throughout the remainder of the year while still investing in our future.\n\nJosh Rohleder\n\nManager of Investor Communications\n\nThanks for that additional color, Josh. And you make a great point about the decrementals. We're definitely being impacted by more definitely being impacted more significantly than usual by the unfavorable mix associated with higher margin products and regions declining more significantly.\nBut I think the key differentiator this year is around more proactive management. Both you and Bill alluded to the rate at which we're bringing in production.\nCory, I'd like to bring you into the conversation now. You've been in the ag business nearly your entire career. What is different in terms of how we have managed the changing environment in this cycle?\n\nCory J. Reed\n\nPresident, John Deere Financial Services, Inc.\n\nYes. Thanks, Josh. We are coming down from [ turf ] high demand, and historically, we would have as an industry, been slow to react to that change. Often, we would drive higher levels of field inventory to the detriment of the following years.\nWithin Deere, we're managing this year differently, which is a testament to the fact that both we and our dealers have learned from the past cycles. This is probably best exemplified by our decision to underproduce large tractor retail demand in North America in the back half of the year.\nWe ended 2023 with really low levels of large tractor inventory, but we think it's prudent to drive those levels even lower as we close out our '24. The key here is that by staying ahead of demand changes, we're giving ourselves the optionality to react most efficiently to whichever way the market moves in the next year.\nI think it's important to note that we're not implying that we know where 2025 demand will be, frankly, this season's crops aren't even in the ground yet. So it's still way too early to opine on that. But we're focused on proactive management to ensure that we keep inventories in balance with demand. This is a key component to ensuring better structural profitability throughout the cycle for our business.\n\nJoshua A. Jepsen\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Deere & Company\n\nThis is Jepsen. One other thing to highlight beyond the current environment, and where we see the long-term strategy leading us, is related to technology and how we engage with our customers. We're starting to think about market share, not only as the number of units sold but as the number of acres covered by Deere products and technologies as a percentage of total acres farmed.\nIn the future, we're going to continue accelerating the utilization of technology as we grow our precision upgrade retrofit business as well as Solution-as-a-Service offerings.\nOur engaged acre journey helps demonstrate the progress we've made in delivering value for customers and making their jobs easier to do. In fact, at the end of the quarter, we now cover over 415 million engaged acres globally, and importantly, highly engaged acres which, as a reminder, means three production steps and value-creating activities in the John Deere operations center are performed, make up over 25% of the engaged acres amount, having grown by double digits this past quarter alone.\nWhile all parts of the world are seeing growth, Brazil is growing faster than North America on both engaged and highly engaged acres, which is a positive sign as we bring more technology to the market, in particular with satellite communications coming soon. And customers there see increased value given the multiple crop harvest each year as well as the ability to improve efficiency, profitability and sustainability in their operations.\n\nJosh Rohleder\n\nManager of Investor Communications\n\nThose are excellent proof points. But one thing we haven't covered yet is costs. A key benefit of proactive cycle management should theoretically be the associated cost savings. We're seeing another year of positive price cost.\nBut can you break down what's driving that positive differential for us?\n\nUnknown Executive\n\nYes, definitely. That's a great point, Josh, and I'm happy to start. I'd begin by referencing back to what Josh Jepsen talked about earlier, along with structural cost reductions, we continue to prioritize managing to our structure lines, which essentially means as production and sales come in, we pull levers to bring in costs.\nOur speed in pulling those levers and the subsequent timing of those actions hitting the bottom line is a top priority right now. The outcomes of these efforts show up in the production cost bar in our quarterly earnings bridge.\nGiven that there's a lot that goes into that cost category, it might be helpful to walk through a few of the notable components.\nStarting with freight and material, we're beginning to see the benefits of our ongoing cost reduction efforts. We're encouraged by the opportunity to get back significant cost on freight and logistics as well as in our material spend. We're truly building strategic partnerships with our supply base as we jointly work to structure sourcing in a way that ultimately creates value for both parties.\nCoupled with our dual sourcing strategies, we've been able to enhance supply chain resiliency in tandem with cost savings, which has been crucial to optimizing returns amidst lower demand.\nThe cost reduction efforts are important given we have seen some manufacturing overhead efficiencies associated with managing to lower production levels. This references back to my comment on the timing of lever pulling and the timing of those actions impacting financials.\nWe're actively taking steps to manage costs as we see demand change, essentially rightsizing the cost structure for a given production level. But in a year when we're moving down in volume, we've experienced some inefficiency as we make those adjustments. This headwind is showing up in the production cost bar as well, largely offsetting the gains that we're seeing in freight, logistics and material spend this year.\n\nJoshua A. Jepsen\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Deere & Company\n\nThis is Jepsen. Maybe one thing worth mentioning is we also pull levers on assets. And that's evident when you look at our cash flow guidance change, which is now less in this guide compared to the change in net income. This is reflective of the fact we're starting to see our inventory come down following our production rate reductions in the first half of the year, creating a source of cash for the business.\nWe're continuing to manage working capital and expect further reductions throughout the remainder of the year.\n\nUnknown Executive\n\nPerfect. And in the spirit of inventory management, I'd like to briefly touch on new and used inventories. Josh Beal, could you give us an update on where we stand today and what to expect in the back half of the year?\n\nJosh Beal\n\nDirector of Investor Relations\n\nYes, absolutely. And I'll start with new equipment. In North America, large ag, we're seeing interests in inventory build as expected, albeit below industry levels and inventory to sales ratio increases in line with historical norms. That said, given our proactive underproduction previously discussed, we expect these numbers to fall by year-end with beginning 2025 inventory to sales ratios are down significantly from where they stand today.\nFurthermore, we expect to see the largest decline in new inventory levels to occur during the fourth quarter as normal year-end seasonal declines are amplified by our planned underproduction for the year.\nOn the used inventory side, we've seen total used units up year-over-year. While combines are up from decade lows, they remain below the highs seen in the last downturn. Meanwhile, used high horsepower tractors have increased more rapidly and are skewing more predominantly to later models, driving up the average value of the equipment. The trend that we're seeing in used high horsepower tractors was a key factor in our decision to underproduce retail demand in North America.\n\nCory J. Reed\n\nPresident, John Deere Financial Services, Inc.\n\nJosh, this is Cory. Just one thing to add here is as you look at the industry as a whole, we've been relatively disciplined. Our large ag new inventory in North America currently represents less than half of the industry's unit inventory and significantly below the industry on an inventory to sales ratio basis. This is reflective of the discipline we're showing in this cycle.\nAnd on the used side, our dealers are hyper-focused on used inventory, managing them appropriately to ensure that they maintain a healthy and a trade ladder for their customers. For example, this cycle, we put a strong focus on our dealer pool funds to help manage used inventories. Dealers accumulate these funds based on new equipment sales and then use them to create competitive packages to help move used equipment.\nOur dealers prudently build up these funds over the last several years, nearly tripling their total available balance which is now providing valuable support in the current market environment.\n\nJosh Rohleder\n\nManager of Investor Communications\n\nThanks, Cory and Josh. That's a good reminder on intra-year seasonality swings and how those play into our larger production and inventory management.\nShifting now to a region we haven't talked much about yet. I'd like to focus on Brazil. There's been quite a bit of buzz down there between first crop harvest, agri show 2 weeks ago, and the recent devastating flooding in Rio Grande de Sul.\nJosh Beal, do you want to kick us off with a quick overview on the state of the business there?\n\nJosh Beal\n\nDirector of Investor Relations\n\nYes, happy to. And definitely a dynamic market to unpack. And I'd like to first start by extending our deepest sympathies to those affected by the tragic flooding you mentioned, Josh, including a significant number of our employees, customers and suppliers. We want to wish everyone well in the recovery, and I want to emphasize that the safety and security of our employees is our first priority as we assess and respond to the impacts of the event.\nOperationally, while we do have facilities in the region, we do not anticipate any long-term impacts to the business at this time.\nTurning to the broader Brazilian ag environment. Soybean farmers saw profitability decline due to adverse weather conditions and global supply surpluses. That said, we do expect some favorable offsets with a strong cotton crop this year and a better-than-expected corn crop, which should provide some support to farmer sentiment for the 2024 season.\nAll in, ag equipment retail demand in the region continues to decline, driving the change in our industry guide.\nWhile production cuts came through as expected for the quarter, retail sales came in lighter than anticipated. Nevertheless, we remain committed to underproducing retail demand in the region this year as we target year-end inventory levels, supportive of building in line with retail in 2025. Ultimately, we'll see more of the planned inventory reduction for the region in the back half of the year.\n\nJosh Rohleder\n",
        "content2": "Manager of Investor Communications\n\nPerfect. Thanks for setting the stage, Josh. Now Cory, I believe you were just down there for Agrishow. Could you give us an update on what you saw there and the sentiment you were hearing from dealers and customers?\n\nCory J. Reed\n\nPresident, John Deere Financial Services, Inc.\n\nAbsolutely. That sentiment was positive, Josh. This is not to say that we've reached an inflection point, given Josh Beal's comments earlier about retail activity. But I think the biggest takeaway was the excitement that we're seeing for our latest tech offerings. In fact, we're taking preorder interest for our StarLink connectivity solution and ended up oversubscribed by the first day of the show. We similarly sold out of our allotments for [ St. Bairey Select ] and our Precision Ag Essentials bundle that was also a great success.\nFundamentally, we're at the forefront of bringing our full ecosystem of solutions to the Brazilian market, and our customers there are very calculated in their investments. They adopt when it makes financial sense, and given the double or sometimes even triple crop rotations they're able to achieve, the payback for much of our technology and equipment is significantly faster than in the North American market.\nI'll take think sprayers as an example. In the U.S., the corner soybean farmer may only spray 3x annually. But in Brazil, a farmer on a soybean and cotton rotation could spray as much as 20x a year. This is why we're so focused on bringing our customers the solutions and connectivity that enables them to drive more value from their operations.\nAnd the great thing is that tech adoption was only half the story at the show at [ Agrishow ]. We saw equipment order interest rebound from last year's lows, including some of our most productive product offerings like our new [ 9Rx ] tractors and [ X9 ] combines. Adding in the strong fundamentals and demand for sugarcane harvesters, we feel optimistic about the future of agriculture in Brazil.\nSo while the competitive landscape continues to expand in the region, we feel confident not only in our ability to deliver additional value to our customers via our integrated solutions, but also through the strong dealer network that we've worked hard to build out. These dealers are providing industry differentiated support to our customers, helping to drive uptime and reliability required in an environment where there's no off-season.\n\nJosh Rohleder\n\nManager of Investor Communications\n\nAwesome. That's really great insight, Cory. Now for the last topic, I'd like to briefly touch on construction and forestry, which is relatively stable this quarter. Earthmoving end markets remain largely unchanged quarter-over-quarter, while road building has seen some minimal shifts in North America, albeit remaining at strong demand levels. .\nJosh Beal, can you give us a little more color on this part of the business and what we should expect for the balance of the year?\n\nJosh Beal\n\nDirector of Investor Relations\n\nDefinitely, Josh. The key takeaway for the quarter is what you noted, minimal change at healthy levels of demand. As we've noted on previous calls, we expected some decline year-over-year unrelated to end market demand as we build less inventory this year relative to 2023.\nWhile contractor backlogs remain healthy and utilization at sustainable levels, we've seen rental CapEx come in, in our new and used inventory levels currently around long-term averages. Our guide is also supported by an order book for earthmoving equipment that extends out approximately 4 months into the fourth quarter.\nThe only other point I'd highlight is around pricing. In addition to strong demand, we're also seeing strong competition, bolstered by industry inventory levels that have recovered and a shift in the competitive landscape with a stronger U.S. dollar. However, we remain committed to a disciplined approach that balances both market share and price. Overall, our earthmoving and road building segments continue to deliver structurally better financial performance than we've seen historically.\n\nJosh Rohleder\n\nManager of Investor Communications\n\nThanks, Josh. That's a great update. And before we open the line to questions, Josh Jepsen, any final comments?\n\nJoshua A. Jepsen\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Deere & Company\n\nCertainly. It was a good second quarter with strong results to round out the first half of the year. Despite a dynamic global ag market and competitive construction environment in North America, we performed at structurally higher levels across the business. Given the pullback we've seen in ag markets, we now expect to end the year moderately below mid-cycle levels.\nThis quarter, we also returned approximately $1.5 billion in cash to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases and remain committed to returning cash to shareholders while concurrently investing in the business via value-accretive CapEx and R&D spending.\nI want to reinforce that we're not new to market cycles, and we've learned from the past, making us a more resilient and better prepared business than ever before. Our proactive management reflects this and demonstrates that we are structurally better business today with equipment margins forecast just above 18% despite unfavorable mix in a rapidly shifting global environment. And as a result, we feel that we are putting ourselves in the best position possible for the future.\nRegardless of where we are in the cycle, we remain committed to our customers and their needs, ensuring our solutions drive real value to their business while Deere and our dealers provide the support they need to be successful. The progress on technology adoption and utilization -- earlier with our engaged and highly engaged ACRE progress, provides evidence of the value in our integrated offering of equipment, technology and digital tools.\nAt the end of the day, we're focused on doing more so our customers can do less, and we are more excited every day about the vast amount of opportunities that lay in front of us.\n\nJosh Rohleder\n\nManager of Investor Communications\n\nThanks, Josh. Now let's open it up to questions from our investors.\n\nJosh Beal\n\nDirector of Investor Relations\n\nWe're now ready to open -- to begin the Q&A portion of the call. The operator will instruct you on the polling procedure. [Operator Instructions]"

John Deere completed the first quarter, demonstrating solid execution across the cycle. Financial results for the quarter included an 18.5% margin for the equipment operations. Fundamentals in the end markets that we serve remain supportive of equipment replacement demand.\nag fundamentals, while down from the record highs of the last few years, have returned to near mid-cycle levels. In Construction & Forestry, we see fundamentals stabilizing at levels supportive of demand across most markets. This demand backdrop is reflected in our order books. While fleet replenishment is moderating, our order books remain at healthy levels, representative of normalized volumes.\nNotably, our first quarter performance demonstrates the structural business improvements that we've achieved, enabling us to deliver higher levels of profitability across all points in the business cycle.\nSlide 3 begins with the results for the first quarter. Net sales and revenues were down 4% to $12.185 billion, while net sales for the equipment operations were down 8% to $10.486 billion. Net income attributable to Deere & Company was $1.751 billion or $6.23 per diluted share.\nTurning now to our individual segments. We begin with the Production and Precision ag business on Slide 4. Net sales of $4.849 billion were down 7% compared to the first quarter last year, primarily due to lower shipment volumes, which were partially offset by price realization. Price realization was positive by about 4 points. Currency translation was also positive by roughly 1 point. Operating profit was $1.045 billion, resulting in a 21.6% operating margin for the segment. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to lower shipment volumes and higher SA&G and R&D expenses. These were partially offset by price realization.\nMoving to small ag and turf on Slide 5. Net sales were down 19%, totaling $2.425 billion in the first quarter, as a result of lower shipment volumes, partially offset by price realization. Price realization was positive by just over 3 points. Currency was also positive by roughly 0.5 point. Operating profit declined year-over-year to $326 million, resulting in a 13.4% operating margin. The decrease was primarily due to lower shipment volumes and higher SA&G and R&D expenses, which were partially offset by price realization and lower production costs.\nSlide 6 gives our industry outlook for ag and turf markets globally. We continue to expect large ag equipment industry sales in the U.S. and Canada to decline 10% to 15%, trending closer to the lower end of that range, as normalizing farm fundamentals and elevated interest rates are somewhat tempered by resilient farm balance sheets, lower input costs relative to record peaks seen over the last few years and fleet age, which even after multiple years of strong replacement, remains at or above long-term averages.\nFor small ag and turf in the U.S. and Canada, industry demand estimates remain down 5% to 10%. The Dairy and Livestock segment continues to remain healthy, thanks to elevated cattle and hay prices. The compact utility tractor market remains soft, as the industry works to bring down inventory levels, while demand for turf products has stabilized.\nMoving to Europe. The industry is now forecasted to be down 10% to 15%. Demand is expected to be softest, Central and Eastern Europe, as local commodity markets remain disrupted by the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. Western Europe is faring better, although uncertainty related to current cash crop proceeds, ag policy changes and high interest rates is increasing caution for some customers.\nIn South America, industry sales of tractors and combines are expected to be down around 10%, continuing the demand moderation that began in 2023. Brazil, in particular, is experiencing adverse weather conditions in the current growing season. Coupled with high interest rates, demand is expected to remain down from recent record highs.\nArgentina is expected to deliver strong ag production after multiple years of [ drought ], while the industry will remain regulated by ongoing economic challenges.\nIndustry sales in Asia remain forecasted to be down moderately.\nNext, our segment forecast to begin on Slide 7. For Production and Precision ag, net sales are forecasted to be down around 20% for the full year. The forecast assumes roughly 1.5 points of positive price realization for the full year and minimal currency impact. For the segment's operating margin our full year forecast is now between 21.5% and 22.5%, reflecting the further tempering net sales as demand normalizes.\nSlide 8 shows our forecast for the small ag and turf segment. We expect net sales to remain down between 10% and 15%. This guidance now includes 1.5 points of positive price realization and flat currency translation. The segment's operating margin remains between 15% and 16%.\nShifting to Construction and Forestry on Slide 9. Net sales for the quarter were roughly flat year-over-year at $3.212 billion, with positive price realization offset by lower shipment volumes. Price realization was positive by nearly 3 points. Currency translation was also positive by just under 1 point. Operating profit of $566 million was down year-over-year, resulting in a 17.6% operating margin, due primarily to higher production costs, lower shipment volumes, unfavorable currency translation and higher SA&G and R&D expenses. These were partially offset by price realization and a favorable sales mix.\nTurning now to our 2024 Construction & Forestry industry outlook on Slide 10. Industry sales for earthmoving equipment in the U.S. and Canada are now expected to be flat to down 5%, while compact construction equipment in the U.S. and Canada is expected to be flat.\nImprovements in the industry outlook are reflective of a better-than-expected demand backdrop and stabilized optimism through the balance of the year, as dealer inventories return to more normal levels.\nEnd markets remain healthy, with single-family housing starts improving, infrastructure spending continuing to increase and elevated manufacturing investment levels offset by further declines in commercial investments.\nGlobal forestry markets are expected to be down around 10%, as all global markets continue to be challenged. Global road building markets are forecasted to be roughly flat, with strong infrastructure spending in the U.S., offset by continued softness in Europe.\nMoving to this Construction & Forestry segment outlook on Slide 11. 2024 net sales are now forecasted to be down between 5% and 10%. Net sales guidance for the year includes about 1.5 points of positive price realization and flat currency translation. The segment's operating margin remains projected between 17% and 18%.\nTransitioning to our financial services operations on Slide 12. Worldwide financial services net income attributable to Deere & Company in the first quarter was $207 million. The increase in net income was mainly due to a higher average portfolio balance, which was partially offset by less favorable financing spreads.\nFor fiscal year 2024, our outlook remains at $770 million, as benefits from a higher average portfolio balance offset less favorable financing spreads. As a reminder, fiscal year 2023 net income was also impacted by a non-repeating onetime accounting correction.\nFinally, Slide 13 outlines our guidance for net income, our effective tax rate and operating cash flow. For fiscal year 2024, our outlook for net income is now expected to be between $7.5 billion and $7.75 billion. Next, our guidance incorporates an effective tax rate between 24% and 26%. And lastly, cash flow from the equipment operations is now projected to be in the range of $7 billion to $7.5 billion.\nThis concludes our formal comments. John, before we shift to a few topics specific to the quarter, would you mind sharing your thoughts on how 2024 is progressing?\n\nJohn C. May\n\nPresident-Agricultural Solutions & Chief Information Officer, Deere & Co.\n\nThanks, Josh. I'd be happy to. We've had a great start to the year. The quarter was strong, and I truly appreciate the efforts of the entire Deere team to deliver these results.\nAs I think about 2024, it's helpful to consider the smart industrial journey that we've been on, which has been grounded in unlocking incremental value for our customers through technology, and enabling Deere to deliver structurally higher financial performance.\nI'm extremely pleased with how we've executed our production systems approach, centralized and advanced our tech stack and focused on delivering value across the entire life cycle of our solutions, all while allocating capital in a more efficient and strategic manner.\nDeere's last few years of financial performance are evidence of the structural improvement that comes with executing our strategy, all while delivering better outcomes for our customers.\nTo put 2024 financials in context, let's look at how we performed since introducing Smart Industrial. In 2022, our equipment operations net sales were just under $48 billion, and we delivered net income of over $7.1 billion, equating to just over $23 of EPS.\nIn 2023, net sales increased 16% to over $55 billion, and we delivered record net income of over $10 billion or $34.63 per share.\nOur 2024 guide implies a roughly 15% reduction in net sales, putting us at very similar sales levels to 2022. However, continuing that comparison, our net income forecast of $7.5 billion to $7.75 billion contemplates at least a $400 million improvement over 2022. On an EPS basis, that's growth of over $4 per share, demonstrating the structural improvement enabled by our smart industrial strategy.\nGoing forward, as we execute our plans under our new operating model, we will deliver better outcomes for our customers and deliver higher levels of financial performance for Deere, generating strong cash flows that will fuel continued reinvestment in the business and significant return to shareholders.\n\nJoshua Rohleder\n\nGreat. Thanks, John. Now let's start off with farm fundamentals this quarter. The USDA just updated 2024 forecast for net cash farm income as well as global supply and demand estimates. U.S. net cash farm income is forecasted to be down over 20% from 2023 levels, albeit up from November estimates.\nAt the same time, global stocks for corn and soybeans are expected to fully recover from decade lows despite lower production in Brazil. Josh Beal, can you provide some additional color on what this means for both farmers and equipment demand over the rest of 2024?\n\nJosh Beal\n\nDirector of Investor Relations\n\nAbsolutely, Josh. I think that's a great place to start. What's most important in this conversation is context. We've certainly seen better-than-expected crop production over the past 6 months. We had record corn yields in the U.S., recovering Argentina crop production is offsetting the losses you mentioned in Brazil and 2 consecutive years of bumper wheat crops in Russia are offsetting losses in Ukraine and Australia. All of that is supporting rising carryover stocks, which are putting downward pressure on prices, culminating and lowered expectations for crop margins. All of these fundamentals are captured in the reduction in the U.S. net cash farm income forecast that you cited.\nBut it's important to keep the expected decline in context of where we've been. We're coming off 3 years of record farm income. The projected reduction puts us in line with historical averages that are still supportive of mid-cycle equipment demand. The punchline here is that farmers continue to be profitable at these levels.\nIn addition to farmer profitability, those other factors that are supportive. The U.S. fleet age remains above 20-year averages for both tractors and combines. Used inventory in the U.S., while having increased, remains at manageable levels. Additionally, farm balance sheets are strong, with U.S. farmland values up approximately 7% year-over-year and debt-to-equity ratio is near all-time lows.\nOutside of the U.S., we're seeing a similar story. Farmers remain profitable in both Europe and South America, albeit down from recent record levels. There's certainly caution in the market, particularly in the high interest rate environment that we're seeing, but we still expect to see replacement demand in both regions.\n\nJoshua Rohleder\n\nThanks, Josh. It's helpful to understand where fundamentals are in relation to historical levels and encouraging to hear that despite a moderation in demand, there remains a supportive macro backdrop.\nAaron, from a sentiment standpoint, what are you hearing in your conversations with customers and dealers?\n\nAaron Wetzel\n\nThanks for the question, Josh. During my recent visits with both dealers and customers across North and South America these past few weeks, I've heard a similar sentiment from customers to what you've outlined. All are coming off record highs these past few years, and with lowering commodity prices and increasing interest rates, they're beginning to shift to a more typical replacement pattern. Dealers in the U.S. continue to see good demand for products, and are proactively managing inventories as the underlying fundamentals of the market change.\nWith this changing environment, customers are seeking opportunities to further improve their productivity and efficiency through the adoption of technology into their operations, technology that will enable them to reduce inputs, improve operational efficiencies and address the labor challenges they face.\n\nJoshua Rohleder\n\nThat's great, Aaron. It's good to hear perspective from our customers and dealers.\nNow Josh Beal, I'd like to pull on a thread you briefly touched on earlier and asked about field inventory levels. Could you give us an update on where we stand today?\n\nJosh Beal\n\nDirector of Investor Relations\n\nAbsolutely. And it's probably best to start with new inventory. An essential element of our performance across the cycle is inventory management. We structure our production schedules to maintain the appropriate level of field inventory, for wherever we are in the cycle. Notably, that's why we continue to produce to retail demand in the North America large ag market.\nAs we noted last quarter, we entered the year well positioned from a field inventory standpoint, and Q1 levels are consistent with normal seasonal changes, comparable with inventory to sales ratios from a year ago. With nearly 90% of orders sourced through our combined sprayer and planter early order programs, we have significant visibility into the balance of the year for those product lines. [ Tractors ] are managed on a rolling order book. And as a quick update, we're currently taking orders into the third quarter for row crop tractors, while our 4-wheel drive tractors are full through the balance of the third quarter.\nAll in all, we expect to end the year in the U.S. and Canada positioned to produce in line with retail demand in 2025.\nLet's move on to new inventory outside of the U.S. and Canada. In Europe, we'll underproduce demand for the remainder of 2024 in response to softening market conditions. In Brazil, we are already seeing progress from our efforts to reduce field inventory in response to the market pullback.\nNotably, combined inventory is down 25% on an absolute basis for the quarter, in line with our expectations, and we are on track to reach target levels by fiscal year-end.\nFor both Europe and Brazil, our intent is to position 2024 year-end inventory, so that we can produce in line with retail demand in 2025.\nAaron, I know you just got back from Brazil. Do you have anything you'd like to add?\n\nAaron Wetzel\n\nYes. In fact, just a few weeks ago, I had the opportunity to visit both dealers and customers in Brazil. I was able to spend time with both sugarcane producers as well as soybean customers in the Mato Grosso.\nSugarcane customers are seeing strong price for sugar today, and are making investments in equipment to drive efficiencies and productivity improvements. Our recently launched CH950 sugarcane harvester is gaining adoption, as it improves harvest efficiencies through its unique [ 2-row ] design and delivers improved fuel efficiency for producers.\nOur soybean customers are continuing to manage through the impacts from dry conditions in the region. Coming off historically high levels of profitability in the last few years, our soybean customers are shifting to a more normal demand of product.\nBoth customers are very optimistic for the future of Brazil as planted area continues to increase and average yields continue to improve, creating even more production to support the growing demand for commodities globally.\n\nJoshua A. Jepsen\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Deere & Company\n\nThis is Jepsen. [ One ] to add is our continued focus in investing in Brazil for the long term. During last past quarter, we announced an investment in a Brazil technology development center to focus on product and solutions suited for tropical agriculture. This should enable us to deliver -- develop and deliver solutions for Brazil, in Brazil and bring them to the market more rapidly.\n\nJoshua Rohleder\n\nAwesome. Thanks all for that additional color. It's great to hear about the developments and optimism in such an exciting growth market.\nNow, Josh Beal, do you want to switch over and touch on used inventory?\n\nJosh Beal\n\nDirector of Investor Relations\n\nYes, definitely. Within used inventory, in North America, we've seen year-over-year increases in both combines and tractors, most notably in the high horsepower tractor segment. Again, to put these increases into context, while levels are up from recent lows, they're still in line with historical averages.\nAdditionally, used prices have remained flat to up over the quarter. All in, we continue to feel comfortable with the used inventory levels that we're seeing.\n\nJoshua A. Jepsen\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Deere & Company\n\nThis is Jepsen again. It's also worth noting that most dealers experienced an end-of-year seasonal increase in used equipment, as they take in trades, as they deliver new machines. This increase in used equivalent typically occurs in the first half of the year, which our dealers are accustomed to handling.\nAnd in fact, I was just with some of our dealers from North America, Australia and New Zealand this past week and heard a consistent message from them. They feel comfortable with used inventory levels, especially when compared to where they were last fall. And many were able to proactively reduce inventory and are feeling good about where we're at today.\nAll that to say, we feel comfortable where we are with current, new and used inventory levels and with the plans we have in place to manage them.\n\nJoshua Rohleder\n\nThank you all. That's really helpful perspective on what has been a topic of interest lately. And on that note, one overarching impact from this discussion that we've yet to address is the updated outlook for the quarter.\nMarkets have clearly shifted this year, but we've maintained strong performance through the first quarter, with 18.5% margins for our equipment operations. This clearly points to the structural improvement that we've achieved, bolstered by a 2024 forecast that would represent our second best year ever from an earnings standpoint.\nWith that in mind, Josh Beal, can you walk us through what's transpired over the last 3 months and how that relates to the rest of the year?\n\nJosh Beal\n\nDirector of Investor Relations\n\nYes. Great points, Josh, and definitely worth unpacking here. Let's start with our Production and Precision ag and small ag and turf businesses.\nBeginning with the quarter, we saw strong year-over-year price realization across both segments. It's worth noting, however, that we expect price realization to moderate throughout the remainder of the year, in line with our annual guide of 1.5 points for both segments.\nRelative to production costs, we saw material and freight coming lower for both large and small ag, leading to favorable year-over-year comparisons for the quarter. This is aligned with our expectations to see slightly favorable production cost compares for both segments for the full year.\nLooking at SA&G, we had unfavorable impacts in the quarter from incentive compensation, timing of spend, which pulled costs forward into the quarter and foreign exchange. Notably, we don't expect the first quarter to be indicative of our SA&G run rate for the rest of the year, as we're pulling levers in line with the rest of our operations.\nShifting to our outlook. We are seeing demand shifts in production of precision ag, impacting combines and large tractors, which is felt mostly in the back half of 2024. Conversely, we're seeing minimal change to our small ag and turf outlook from last quarter, as the dairy and high-value crop segments remain stable.\nIt's important to reiterate here that our plans in large ag to produce to retail demand in North America and underproduced retail in Brazil and Europe, reflect our commitment to inventory and cycle management. This approach should position us well going into 2025 across all geographies.\n\nAaron Wetzel\n\nThis is Aaron. I'd like to add quickly. I believe the key opportunity here is our proactive management of production levels to adjust for the changes we are seeing in our end market demand. We have been highly effective in managing through the changing market dynamics in the U.S., and we'll continue to remain focused on disciplined execution of our pricing strategies in order to maintain performance as we move through the cycle.\n\nJoshua Rohleder\n\nThanks, Aaron, and Josh. That's really helping bridge between the ag industry outlook and our tier forecast.\nLet's shift now to Construction & Forestry, we haven't really touched on yet. Results for the quarter came in better than expected, with margins slightly off year-over-year compares, given flat sales levels.\nJosh Beal, can you walk us through how activity in the quarter has impacted our 2024 outlook?\n\nJosh Beal\n\nDirector of Investor Relations\n\nAbsolutely. The key takeaway from the quarter is that underlying demand is stabilizing at levels higher than expected, while at the same time, the industry has become more competitive, given inventory availability.",
        "content2": "Looking forward, Deere inventory levels have recovered and are now in line with the industry. We expect slightly stronger sales through the back half of the year, which is embedded in our updated outlook. Demand will be driven by key end markets, where optimism remains strong. All of this is reflected in our order books, which for Construction and Forestry are full through the second quarter across most product lines, with compact construction equipment notably full through the end of the third quarter.\n\nJoshua A. Jepsen\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Deere & Company\n\nThis is Jepsen. I'd like to emphasize quickly the runway that remains on government infrastructure projects in the U.S. Through 2023, roughly 40% of the [ IIJ ] dollars have been awarded, but relatively minimal amounts have actually been spent thus far. Needless to say, we expect infrastructure spending to provide a strong tailwind, well into '25 and '26 across both our construction and road building segments, as dollars are awarded and projects commence.\n\nJoshua Rohleder\n\nThanks for that color, Josh. It really helps contextualize the opportunity ahead.\nShifting gears now. Let's talk about the importance of managing across varying end markets. Josh Beal, coming back to you, can you walk us through what we're doing to manage the current environment?\n\nJosh Beal\n\nDirector of Investor Relations\n\nYes, for sure. First and foremost, it's proactive actions to ensure we stay ahead of demand changes. All of our factories and product lines have a list of levers we pull, depending on the magnitude and direction of the volume change that we're seeing. Those efforts are ultimately grounded in our focus on inventory management, which we spoke about earlier. The underproduction in retail in certain geographies and production to retail in North America directly reflect this laser focus on inventory management as a key pillar to maintaining price discipline and structural profitability across the cycle.\nOn the cost side, supply chain management is of utmost importance. Our team is working continuously to ensure not only that we're getting the best price on purchase components, but that we're also maintaining a robust sourcing pipeline to ensure the resiliency of our supply base.\nThis year, we are seeing the impact of our strategic partnerships and supplier agreements come to fruition. Additionally, we continue to design cost reduction into our products.\nAs noted previously, we expect the impact of these savings to drive year-over-year production cost favorability for our equipment operations, despite headwinds in other spend categories.\n\nJoshua A. Jepsen\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Deere & Company\n\nOne more thing to add here. All of this work ultimately impacts our decremental margins, as we make decisions to proactively manage production and inventory levels. As we've noted, we'll underproduce in some regions, which will impact decrementals, as we dial down production faster than we realized savings from pulling levers.\nAdditionally, we're negatively impacted by unfavorable mix from declines in high-margin products like combines and tractors, as well as geographies such as Brazil and North America. Importantly, we continue to robustly invest in future value unlock opportunities.\n\nJoshua Rohleder\n\nAwesome. And that's a great segue into my last question, which is for Aaron.\nHistorically, we've maintained consistent R&D spend throughout the cycle, which in part, reflects our commitment to leading through innovation. The ag industry is going through a precision ag revolution, and Deere has been on this journey for nearly 25 years.\nAaron, can you give us an update on where we're at in our LEAP ambitions and Precision ag journey?\n\nAaron Wetzel\n\nSure. Within our production and precision ag business, our LEAP ambitions are to help customers produce more with less, less inputs like herbicides and fertilizers and more productivity through more efficient use of labor.\nOne measurement for this progress is through our engaged ACRE metrics, where we are planning to achieve 500 million acres engaged by 2026. As customers use our machines and technologies, we expect to see those engaged acres continue to grow. To propel this, we will continue to make significant investments in R&D, prioritized by the needs of our customers around the world and the value we can unlock.\nOur Production and Precision ag strategy is predicated on 3 distinct pillars: product leadership, system leadership; and finally, go-to-market leadership. Our products are our machines. They are the foundation of our work and enable customers to do the job in the field every day. Customers rely on our machines during critical times of the year, like planting or harvesting, and need those machines to perform. In fact, we will be reinforcing this focus through one of our most significant new product launches coming in a few weeks.\nCustomers will see our commitment to provide them with the most advanced machines, new levels of productivity and ability to perform their jobs faster and with more precision. It's going to be exciting and will have an impact on most of our Production and Precision ag portfolio. Again, reinforcing our commitment to product leadership through industry-leading machine performance and quality.\n\nJoshua Rohleder\n\nThanks, Aaron. It's great to hear about the foundational heart iron that enables us to invest in more advanced solutions. And it sounds like there's a lot more to come on the new product front, beginning with the commodity classic event at the end of the month. So we'll wait to say any more until then.\nNow the second pillar you highlighted is system leadership. Could you start by defining this for us before breaking down what we're doing on this front?\n\nAaron Wetzel\n\nSure. The system is the key differentiating factor for us in the market. It's the integration of our technology solutions into our machines that make it easier for customers to more precisely plant seeds and apply chemicals and nutrients. The seamless integration of capturing the data from the action in the field and sending it to the cloud, allows customers to make better decisions and develop more efficient and sustainable practices on their farms.\nOur technology stack is helping growers reduce costs, improve efficiencies as well as increase yields, generating more profitability for their operations. This translates to significant savings for them as well as more sustainable practices for the environment.\nAnd all of this is enhanced through the use of one key foundational technology, machine connectivity. And for years, we've been working with customers to connect machines through cellular connectivity. However, there are many areas of the world where terrestrial cellular connectivity is not available, like Brazil, for example, where nearly 70% of the current ag productive area does not have access to any connectivity.\nThis is why we recently entered into an agreement with SpaceX to provide satellite connectivity for our customers. Connectivity that will enable real-time data access, which will drive cost savings and efficiency improvements in customer operations, while also providing the foundation for future advancements in automation and autonomy. This will be key to addressing the growing labor challenges facing our customers today.\n\nJoshua Rohleder\n\nThat's really well articulated, Aaron. You can clearly see how complete system integration creates value, well beyond any individual component and how connectivity is foundational to unlocking this opportunity.\nThe natural progression then from tech stack development and integration lead us to the last pillar, you noted, our go-to-market strategy. Successfully designing precision equipment and technology is a feat within itself, but deploying these solutions is another challenge all on its own. What are we doing to solve this part of the equation?\n\nAaron Wetzel\n\nYes. The third pillar of our strategy is around our dealer channel and our go-to-market capabilities to sell and support not only the equipment, but also the suite of technologies available for customers. Our dealers understand deeply the needs of their customers and where their customers are in their own technology journey, as they work with each customer to provide them solutions to improve their operations.\nFurthermore, we are providing the dealers with enhanced tools and capabilities to drive greater adoption and utilization of our technologies. We've launched our Solutions as a Service approach with customers, where we're lowering the overall upfront cost of technology and shifting to a pay-as-you-go model. Our initial experiences have been extremely favorable, as we engage a broader range of customers with our technology.\nAdditionally, we're gearing up our precision upgrade offerings to further drive technology utilization on many of our existing machines in the field. See & Spray premium is one of the latest products that enables customers with late model sprayers to take advantage of the savings that See & Spray provides. Early demand for this solution has been strong and beyond our initial expectations.\n\nJoshua A. Jepsen\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Deere & Company\n\nAnd one more thing to add as it relates to go to market. We've seen tremendous response to our newly released Precision ag Essentials upgrade kit, which is our display receiver and modem with SaaS go-to-market approach, offering low upfront cost and annual subscription.\nOrders exceeded our expectations, and this approach allows us to reach deeper into the installed base of equipment, as a large portion of the sales were incremental, going to customers that did not previously have this level of technology on their existing machines.\n\nJoshua Rohleder\n\nThanks, Aaron, and Josh. That's a great update. And before we open the line to questions, Josh Jepsen, any final comments?\n\nJoshua A. Jepsen\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Deere & Company\n\nIt was a good first quarter, with strong results to get the year going. Fundamentals, overall, began normalizing across our businesses and are supportive of near mid-cycle volume levels.\nWe returned $1.7 billion in cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases during the quarter, while also investing in record levels of R&D to bring new solutions to market.\nIt was also exciting to see the team highlight some of our solutions at the Consumer Electronics Show in January that are unlocking value for customers, not just economic value, but sustainable value as well.\nThe company has been through economic cycles in the past, and we know how to manage through various stages of end market demand. As John noted, we expect to perform better across all points of the cycle, as evidenced by our nearly 19% equip ops operating margin forecast just below mid-cycle levels, while remaining focused on managing production and inventories proactively.\nWe are, at the same time, focused on building a more resilient, less variable business while delivering more value to customers than ever before. We will continue to adapt our business model to enable customers to adopt, use and benefit from our tech stack.\nOne important thing to consider, our customers do critical work to produce food, fiber, fuel, shelter and infrastructure. The trend of fewer people going to work in these areas is not slowing, and we hear this from our customers each and every day.\nWhat this means is that our solutions need to do more and no one is better positioned to meet our customers' needs than we are, given our ability to seamlessly integrate hardware, software, data, financing and service and support. Importantly, our team of Deere and dealer employees get up each day with a purpose and passion to make our customers' lives easier and enable them to do more with less.\n\nJoshua Rohleder\n\nThanks, Josh. Now let's open it up to questions from our investors.\n\nJosh Beal\n\nDirector of Investor Relations\n\nNow we're ready to begin the Q&A portion of the call. The operator will instruct you on the polling procedure. In consideration of others and to allow more of you to participate in the call, please limit yourself to one question. If you have additional questions, we ask that you rejoin the queue."

I will now turn the call over to Josh Rohleder.\n\nJosh Rohleder - Manager of Investor Communications, John Deere\n\nGood morning, and an early happy holidays to everyone.\nJohn Deere finished the year with an excellent fourth quarter, thanks in part to strong margins of 23% for equipment operations. Continued outperformance throughout the year resulted in 16% top line net sales and revenue growth for 2023. Operating margins came in for the year, just shy of 22%, helping generate nearly $12 billion in operating cash flow. Across our businesses, performance was driven by strong market demand, operational execution and improved production costs.\nLooking ahead to 2024, shifting AG market dynamics will lead to a decline in demand. However, we expect to hold the structural gains in profitability achieved over the last few years, delivering expected decrementals off our 2023 baseline financial performance. Meanwhile, the construction and forestry market demand outlook remains mixed, with uncertainty in housing and commercial investments, partially offset by tailwind from mega projects and infrastructure spending.\nSlide three opens with the results for fiscal year 2023. Net sales and revenues were up 16% to $61.3 billion, while net sales for equipment operations were also up 16% to $55.6 billion. Net income attributable to Deere and Company was $10.2 billion or $34.63 per diluted share. Next, fourth quarter results are on slide four. Net sales and revenues were down 1% to $15.4 billion, while net sales for the equipment operations were down 4% to $13.8 billion. However, net income attributable to Deere and Company increased to $2.4 billion or $8.26 per diluted share.\nMoving to slide five, we'll review our fourth quarter segment results, starting with our Production and Precision AG business. Net sales of $6.965 billion were down 6% compared to the fourth quarter last year. This was primarily due to lower shipment volumes, partially offset by price realization. Price realization in the quarter was positive by about 10 points. Currency translation was also positive by about 1 point.\nOperating profit was $183.6 billion, resulting in a 264% operating margin for the segment. The year-over-year increase in operating profit was primarily due to price realization, partially offset by lower shipment volumes and sales mix as well as higher SA&G and R&D spend. Notably, production costs came in favorable for the quarter. Recall that tough fourth quarter year-over-year comps for PPA were expected due to supply chain issues in 2022, which drove late shipments and out-of-season deliveries into the fourth quarter.\nTurning to Small AG and Turf on slide six. Net sales were down 13% totaling $3.094 billion in the fourth quarter due to lower shipment volumes, partially offset by price realization. Price realization in the quarter was positive by nearly 5 points. Currency was also positive by approximately 1 point. For the quarter, operating profits declined year-over-year to $444 million, resulting in a 14.3% operating margin. The decrease was primarily due to lower shipment volumes and mix along with higher SA&G and R&D expenses, partially offset by price realization and production costs.\nPlease flip to slide seven for the fiscal year 2024 AG and Turf industry outlook. We expect large AG equipment industry sales in the US and Canada to decline 10% to 15%, reflecting softening sales on the heels of three years of strong demand, coupled with moderating farm fundamentals and high interest rates weighing on discretionary equipment purchases. Headwinds will be tempered by healthy farm balance sheets, declining input costs, supported fleet fundamentals and continued profitability following record years.\nFor Small AG and Turf in the US and Canada, industry demand is estimated to be down 5% to 10%. The dairy and livestock segment continues to remain steady thanks to elevated protein and hay prices. This is offset by subdued demand in the Turf and Compact Utility Tractor markets, which are closely tied to single family home sales and home improvement spending, both of which remain under pressure from higher interest rates.\nShifting to Europe, the industry is forecasted to be down around 10%. Foreign fundamentals in the region continue to be mixed with opposing dynamics between Eastern and Western Europe. Eastern Europe continues to be impacted by grain inflows from Ukraine, driving down commodity prices. While Western Europe remains profitable with favorable grain prices and declining input costs stabilizing equipment demand in 2024. Dairy and livestock risks have also abated in recent months, with livestock prices forecasted roughly flat after coming down from record highs in early 2023 and dairy and cash flow beginning to bottom.\nIn South America, we expect industry sales of tractors and combines to be down about 10%, moderated by strong headwinds during 2023. Brazil, in particular, was challenged with political uncertainty early on and a delayed government AG financing plan announcement. Coupled with already high interest rates and lower commodity prices that reduced farm profitability, the cumulative impact of these headwinds ultimately led to slower retail sales in the second half of 2023. This has been exacerbated most recently by severe dryness in northern Brazil and flooding in the south to start the 2024 planting season.\nAcross the rest of South America, elevated interest rates and heightened economic uncertainty, primarily, in Argentina are further dampening expectations. Industry sales in Asia are also projected to be down moderately, notably with India, the world's largest tractor market by units, down around 5%.\nTurning to our segment forecast on slide eight. We anticipate production in Precision AG net sales to be down between 15% and 20% in fiscal year 2024. The forecast assumes approximately 1.5 points of positive price realization and flat currency translation. Segment operating margin forecast for the full fiscal year is between 23% and 24%, reflecting our ability to sustain gains in structural profitability.\nSlide nine gives our forecast for the Small AG and Turf segment. We expect fiscal year '24 net sales to be down between 10% and 15%. This includes about 1 point of positive price realization and flat currency translation. The segment's operating margin is projected to be between 15% and 16%.\nShifting to construction and forestry on slide 10. Price realization and higher shipment volumes, both contributed to an 11% increase in net sales for the quarter to $374.2 billion. Price realization in the quarter was positive by over 6 points. This was supported by just over 1 point of positive currency translation. Operating profit increased to $516 million, resulting in a 13.8% operating margin. Favorable price realization more than offset higher production costs and unfavorable currency exchange during the quarter.\nSlide 11 provides our 2024 construction and forestry industry outlook. Industry sales for earthmoving equipment in the US and Canada are expected to be down 5% to 10% while compact construction equipment in the US and Canada is expected to be flat to down 5%. Well, and market segments vary.\nOil and gas continues to be stable and while housing starts and non-res investments require caution due to the current interest rate environment, US infrastructure and megaproject spending supports continued equipment investment. Global forestry markets are expected to be down around 10% as all global markets continue to be challenged. Global road building markets are forecasted to be roughly flat, reflective of continued strong infrastructure spending in the US offset by softening in Europe.\nContinuing with our C&F segment outlook on slide 12. 2024 net sales are forecasted to be down around 10%. Our net sales guidance for the year includes about 1.5 points of positive price realization and flat currency translation. The segment's operating margin is projected to be between 17% and 18%, reflecting the continued structural shift in profitability for C&F.\nAnd ultimately, let's transition to our financial service operations on slide 13. Worldwide financial services net income attributable to Deere and Company was $190 million for the fourth quarter. The year-over-year decline was mainly due to unfavorable derivative market valuation adjustments, coupled with less favorable financing spreads and a higher provision for credit losses. These factors were partially offset by income earned on our higher average portfolio.\nFor fiscal year 2024, the net income forecast $770 million. Results are expected to be higher year-over-year, primarily due to income earned on our higher average portfolio and in non-repeating one-time accounting correction that occurred in 2023. These will be partially offset by less favorable financing spreads and lower gains on operating lease residual values.\nFinally, slide 14 outlines our guidance for net income, our effective tax rate and operating cash flow. For fiscal year 2024, our full year net income forecast is expected to be between $7.75 billion and $8.25 billion, demonstrating executional discipline despite increasing pressure from industry headwinds. Next, our guidance incorporates an effective tax rate between 24% and 26%.\nLastly, cash flow from equipment operations is projected to be in the range of $8 billion to $8.5 billion. To close, our ability to generate approximately $8 billion in net income at near mid-cycle sales levels in fiscal year '24 is a testament to the positive structural impacts we've seen from executing our strategy.\nThis now concludes our formal remarks, let's turn to a few key topics of interest before opening the line for Q&A. I'd like to start with the year-end review before we jump to 2024. Not only did we have a record fourth quarter in terms of net income but we finished the full year with net sales and revenues, as well as net income eclipsing the $60 billion and $10 billion mark, respectively. Brent, can you breakdown what went well both quarter and the year?\n\nBrent Norwood - Head of Investor Relations, John Deere\n\nSure, Josh. That's a great question. Let's start with the quarter, which was a tremendous finish to the year and really boil down to solid execution as we delivered against the year's backlog of orders. During the quarter, our factories resumed normal seasonal shipment patterns, meaning we consistently hit forecasted line rates in our factories and delivered on our commitment to customers.\nIn markets like North America Large AG, nearly all shipments were pre-sold, enabling us to demonstrate disciplined inventory management. Furthermore, pricing remained strong through the close of the year, helping us keep pace with some of the inflationary pressures over the last few years.\nOn the execution side, we saw positive year-over-year production cost comps in the fourth quarter for the first time in over three years, for both Production and Precision AG and Small AG and Turf. This is a direct result of our team's efforts to rein in inflationary costs, combined with some relief on raw materials and freight prices which have come down from record highs. Overall, these factors drove a strong finish to an incredible year, making 2023 a story of disciplined execution.\nFollowing multiple years of a disruptive and challenging environment, we worked through our order books with on time deliveries, enabling most products to move off restricted allocation. Pricing caught up with inflation and we saw supply chain revert to normal, which ultimately meant we were able to deliver products to customers on time and at expected costs.\n\nJoshua Jepsen - Sr. VP & CFO, John Deere\n\nThis is Jepsen here. Maybe to add, I think the overarching takeaway here is that we're finally getting back to steady state of execution, as Brent mentioned. Factory production schedules and customer deliveries have returned to traditional seasonal patterns, which has been very good for the business. And we expect that 2024 will be much the same, meaning we'll see the highest levels of production in the second and third quarter, aligning with the primary use periods for farm and construction equipment.\nMeanwhile, the first quarter will embed lower production rates, allowing for model year changeovers, required factory maintenance and shutdowns during the holiday season. So similar to last year, we expect the first quarter top line to be down 20% to 25% sequentially and for first quarter margins, to be 300 to 400 basis points lower than the full year guide.\n\nJosh Rohleder - Manager of Investor Communications, John Deere\n\nThat's great color, Brent and thanks for the reminder on seasonality, Josh. It's been a few years since we've been able to use seasonal trends as a guide for future expectations. And speaking of future expectations, this is a perfect segue into my next question, which is probably top of mind for everybody today.\nOur 2024 guidance would indicate that markets will be a bit more dynamic next year. I know there's a lot to unpack here, Brent, but maybe you could walk us through what we could expect by segment and geography?\n\nBrent Norwood - Head of Investor Relations, John Deere\n\nThanks, Josh. Definitely a lot to unpack here. Why don't we start with Large AG in North America. Farm fundamentals are expected to remain sound in 2024, albeit down from record highs of the last few years. That said, customers are still profitable heading into 2024 with balance sheets bolstered by multiple years of record net income. Farm debt-to-equity ratios are forecasted to remain at historic lows, thanks in part to continued increases in farmland value. And while commodity prices trend lower, we still expect crop cash receipts to be the third highest in 2024.\nSimilarly, corn and soy cash margins will be down from highs but remain above levels experienced in the back half of the last decade. Lower input costs are offsetting some of the impact from lower prices for soft commodities, fertilizer cost, for example, is now below 2021 levels.\nFinally, North American yields are coming in better than expected, which could drive some tax buying for used equipment during the remainder of the calendar year. There's certainly a lot of puts and takes to farm fundamentals this year, but the takeaway is that lower commodity prices and higher interest rates are weighing on equipment demand. But even still, cash margins are still supportive of replacement at mid-cycle volumes. And after three years of healthy fleet replacement levels, customers will have a little more discretion on equipment CapEx decisions, creating a more dynamic volume environment for the next year.\nNow, turning to an equipment sales perspective, we see a really mixed bag in 2024. To give a little color, I'll start with our early order program results by products. As previously noted on the third quarter call, our model year 2024 sprayer Early Order Program ended strong; up year-over-year and planters were flat year-over-year with revenues bolstered by a strong mix for Larger Equipment and higher Precision AG take rates.\nAnd while early orders are flat to up for our crop care products, we will still be making or we will be making minimal post-season deliveries in 2024, which will put some downward pressure on shipment volumes when compared to 2023. While our combine Early Order Program does not finish until the end of November, we expect volumes to be down double digits when compared to 2023.\nFinally, we managed tractors on a rolling order book basis, our row crop tractor orders are booked through most of the second quarter with similar production levels to 2023. Meanwhile, four-wheel drive tractors are sold out through the end of the third quarter, reflecting continued strong demand and restricted availability for the product line in 2024.\n\nJosh Rohleder - Manager of Investor Communications, John Deere\n\nOkay. So it sounds like EOPs are running the full gamut across our product lines. I guess that purports the next question, how are we positioned going into the year from an inventory perspective?\n\nBrent Norwood - Head of Investor Relations, John Deere\n\nOur teams did a tremendous job in 2023, managing North America production in line with the retail demand. To put that in context, for new equipment, year-end inventory to sales ratios are at 15% for 220-plus horsepower tractors, 9% for four-wheel drive tractors and just 4% for combines. We are well-positioned to produce in line with retail demand again this year for the North American market.\nFurthermore, on the used inventory side, dealers have done an amazing job proactively managing volumes. Take combines, for example. Ending fiscal year inventory is down 22% from its intra-year high in May and down nearly 40% below the 10-year average. And while used high-horsepower tractors have recovered from historic lows, they are still about 20% below the 10-year average.\nSo, all in all, we feel really good about the starting position for 2024 from an inventory basis. Which is really important as end markets inflect a bit next year. When compared to prior replacement cycles, we've managed inventory much tighter in North America than ever before.\n\nJustin Rose - President of Lifecycle Solutions, Supply Management and Customer Success, John Deere\n\nThis is Justin. Just to add on here, markets ebb and flow, we've learned from prior cycles and know how to manage through them and execute on the things we control as demonstrated by Brent's comments on North American Large AG inventory.\n\nJosh Rohleder - Manager of Investor Communications, John Deere\n\nThat's great to hear Josh and Brent I'd actually like to pull on a threat to you hinted at just a second ago. Our guide would imply that demand modulates in some markets for 2024. Could you compare how we're positioned today relative to prior replacement periods?\n\nBrent Norwood - Head of Investor Relations, John Deere\n\nAbsolutely. There are really a few different variables that make this replacement period distinct from prior periods in the North American market. First, is large AG inventory levels, which we've already talked about. These remains significantly below long-term averages. In fact, new inventories for both combines and 220-plus horsepower tractors are 30% below 2013 levels and while four-wheel drive tractors are 60% below that same year.\nSecondly, fleet age is significantly older today than in 2013, when the fleet was the youngest in recorded history. Combines are roughly in line with long-term averages while large tractors remain nearly two years above the mean and have yet to inflect downward meaningfully. Importantly, a higher fleet age helps dampen the amplitude of the cycle.\nAdditionally, farmer balance sheets are much healthier today, driven primarily by higher farmland values and years of profitable seasons. Finally, even with higher interest rates, financing options remain prevalent for farmers. At the same time, we've decreased the size of our leasing portfolio and limited leasing options to three to five-year terms, eliminating short-term leases which drove higher used inventory levels in the 2014 to 2016 period.\nThe key message here is that the production constraints of the last few years combined with better inventory discipline from Deere, positions the company really well as demand pivots in 2024.\n\nJoshua Jepsen - Sr. VP & CFO, John Deere\n\nThis is Jepsen. Two things to point out here. First, is that we're a different company today versus a decade ago and we've managed the replacement cycle better than the past. Certainly, we have work to do but we know where we need to focus and we'll execute. The second, is around our ability to deliver solutions that help farmers reduce cost and increase profits, is much greater today than it was in the past. Farmers now have a breadth of new Precision AG technologies which can help differentiate their operations in an increasingly competitive global market.\n\nJosh Rohleder - Manager of Investor Communications, John Deere\n\nOkay. Thanks, Brent and Josh, that makes a ton of sense. Quite a bit of time now on North America, can we shift over to South America. Josh, would you walk us through what's happening down there?\n\nJoshua Jepsen - Sr. VP & CFO, John Deere\n\nOf course. I think it's best to start with what happened in '23 which is driving much of our expectations for '24. And as we noted, Brazil has been a very dynamic market with a number of temporary headwinds. We experienced industry demand weaken much faster than expected in the second half of the year for the reasons, Josh Rohleder, you mentioned earlier. For example, we saw combine retail sales down about 25% and large tractor retail is down close to 10% in the second half of 2023, demonstrating the volatility we experienced.\nAs a result, we, along with the rest of the industry ended up building more inventory than planned--even though we pulled back production in 2023. Therefore, we will underproduce demand next year and our 2024 guide reflects us bringing inventory back to target levels.\nImportantly, we will continue to invest in the market due to the tremendous potential of our integrated offerings across production systems to drive productivity, profitability and sustainability for producers in the region. All the while, building a more resilient and responsive business to handle market fluctuations.\n\nJosh Rohleder - Manager of Investor Communications, John Deere\n\nOkay. Thanks, Josh. Now, let's finish up on the AG side with Europe. What are the dynamics over there, Brent?\n\nBrent Norwood - Head of Investor Relations, John Deere\n\nYou know, while volumes will be down a bit next year, Europe remains more stable relative to the other markets we've already discussed. It's been a consistent story and we expect 2024 to be no different. While large tractor demand finished strong, we did see moderation across mid-tractors and combines. We were able to manage production accordingly and feel well-positioned heading into 2024.\nGiven the continued headwinds and a competitive market environment, we expect orders for 2024 to be down, in line with industry demand. And with order books approximately 45% full, this gives us visibility through most of the first half of the year. Ultimately, we remain committed to executing our business strategy in Europe. Our focus remains on offering differentiated value to our customers through increasing Precision tech adoption.\n\nJosh Rohleder - Manager of Investor Communications, John Deere\n",
        "content2": "Thanks, Brent. That's really helpful. Let's shift now to C&F. With 2023 being a story of rental and dealer re-fleeting, following two years of constrained production, what should we expect to see in 2024? And then secondly, we've heard a lot about megaproject in infrastructure spending still to come and guidance is down for the next fiscal year. Can you walk us through what's going on there?\n\nBrent Norwood - Head of Investor Relations, John Deere\n\nYou bet, Josh. On one hand, you have strong end markets and infrastructure, as you noted earlier, which are offset by some caution in our guide around residential and the office and commercial sector, given elevated interest rates. On the other hand, you have these megaprojects and systemic investments in  S manufacturing, which will be significant, albeit hard to predict on timing.\nWhere we've seen the most consistency is in road building--as US government funding, both local and federal--has driven expectations for another solid year for the Wirtgen Group. With respect to inventories, the broader industry built field inventory at a faster pace than we did in 2023. While we did recover from the historic low inventories of 2022, we still trailed the industry. So we'll have a few pockets of further inventory build in 2024.\nMarket dynamics aside, we are a structurally better business today than we were just a few years ago, which is evidenced by our nearly doubled margins in the last four years. From the acquisition of Wirtgen, which gave us exposure to an excellent road building end market, to our decision to develop a Deere-designed excavator, we've really concentrated our focus on the margin accretive areas of that business.\n\nJosh Rohleder - Manager of Investor Communications, John Deere\n\nThat's helpful insight into the various end market dynamics, Brent. The sound execution of our C&F business really looks to be paying off as we see another year of high margins and reduced decrementals relative to our historical performance. I'd like now to switch the focus over to our tech stack. Brent, could you give us an update on the business model and where we stand across See & Spray, autonomy and the latest Gen5 display operating system?\n\nBrent Norwood - Head of Investor Relations, John Deere\n\nSure. We've made some big strides across our entire tech product portfolio this year. With much of the focus on our retrofit solutions or what we refer to as precision upgrades. With See & Spray, which is our down payment on Cincinnati Technologies, we successfully launched See & Spray Ultimate for model year 2024 and have seen significant interest in our limited release of See & Spray Premium, the retrofit kit, which can be applied all the way back to model year 2018 sprayers. We are targeting a significant push for premium into the installed base in 2025, supported by our solutions as a service business model.\nFor See & Spray premium, we've kept the upfront capital costs for hardware and installation to a minimum, followed by a per acre use model that aligns our monetization with our customers value. Meanwhile, our autonomy journey is progressing nicely with plans for acreage expansion through our paid pilots in 2024. Our 2023 pilots generated substantial insights and model training, while our key metrics improved significantly year-over-year for KPIs like uptime without intervention, meantime between interventions and reductions and false positives.\nThe progress here will set us up for broader commercialization with opportunities to accelerate utilization through retrofitting autonomy in the installed base of our tractors. What we started seeing is that when a customer tries out new precision technology for the first time, they rarely go back. So the key here is adoption and utilization, which is made easier through our Gen5 display. Another innovative example of our focus on production systems and lifecycle solutions.\nThis new display is key to helping farmers unlock significant productivity gains across their entire fleet of equipment. Coupled with the latest StarFire receiver and modem, a farmer can add basic precision features such as auto-track infection control to tractors more than a decade old. This is a critical step in helping farmers enable less seasoned operators to do tasks that would have historically required someone with years of experience to do.\nOverall, our continued investment in the tech stack and business model transformation reflects our commitment to delivering customer value and productivity regardless of the equipment age.\n\nJosh Rohleder - Manager of Investor Communications, John Deere\n\nThat's all really exciting, Brent, and it looks like we continue to demonstrate our commitment to the business strategy with stable through-cycle investments and innovation. To that extent, maintaining the gains in structural profitability we've achieved over the last few years requires diligent cost management across the business. We've already noted the significant effort we put into reducing cost in 2023 but Brent, can you share how we're thinking about cost management for 2024?\n\nBrent Norwood - Head of Investor Relations, John Deere\n\nThat's a great question, Josh. 2023 was really all about getting the low-hanging fruit. From premium freight to declining raw material costs, we did a good job at wringing out a decent amount of disruption-related inefficiencies. As we look forward into 2024, we remain focused on continuing to tackle inflationary costs and we think there's substantial opportunity across both direct and indirect material, as well as logistics and overhead.\nWe've already begun to see these impacts show up in our financials, to an extent. The fourth quarter was the first time we've seen production costs flip positive for both Production and Precision AG and Small AG and Turf, driven primarily by material and freight. Our 2024 guide implies that overall production costs will be slightly favorable for the full year. As price realization moderates to normal levels, the focus on cost becomes an increasingly more important component to maintaining and improving our cost position. The focus on reducing our direct and indirect materials as well as our logistics cost becomes especially acute given the continued rise in labor cost across many of our markets.\n\nJoshua Jepsen - Sr. VP & CFO, John Deere\n\nThis is Josh Jepsen again. One thing to add to Brent's comments there is just the effort of our teams. These costs don't come out overnight nor do they come from the work of one loan group. It takes a lot of hard work across the board to make this happen. Part of our success over the past few years has been our ability to manage our business and run a lean operation, capable of adapting quickly to changing environments, while maintaining the clear priority of taking care of customers. Our teams remain focused on cost management and I expect we'll see the benefit of these efforts as we move forward.\n\nJosh Rohleder - Manager of Investor Communications, John Deere\n\nOkay, great. And my final question is back to you, Josh. We've had a significant year from a cash flow perspective. Can you talk briefly about our use of cash priorities and capital allocation in '24 and then what we might expect in 2024?\n\nJoshua Jepsen - Sr. VP & CFO, John Deere\n\nSure. We saw excellent cash flow conversion in 2023, allowing us to execute on all of our priorities. Liquidity, along with our single A credit rating remains in good shape which has allowed us to reinvest diligently in the business. This has never been more important than today. Despite topline guidance being down in 2024, we are well-positioned to continue our organic and inorganic investments in the business. In particular, we plan to maintain a similar investment level in R&D next year.\nNext, we're able to increase our dividend by nearly 20% this year, reflecting our confidence in a structurally more profitable business today than in years past. And finally, we completed the year with nearly $7.2 billion in share repurchases. Over the last three years, we've returned nearly 75% of our cash from the equipment operations to shareholders via dividends and buybacks. And as we execute on the strategy, we remain committed to disciplined use of cash.\n\nJosh Rohleder - Manager of Investor Communications, John Deere\n\nThanks, Josh. Now before we open up the line for questions, do you have any final thoughts you'd like to share?\n\nJoshua Jepsen - Sr. VP & CFO, John Deere\n\nYeah that'd be great. It's been a truly phenomenal year for us in 2023. Our teams executed well, recovering from some of the production challenges in 2022. As a result, we ended the year setting new levels of structural profitability on margins, net income and earnings per share, while investing significantly in the business and returning cash to shareholders.\nSince 2020, we focused on four key things, which are driving our results. We restructured the entire enterprise to mirror the production systems of our customers to focus on value unlock via incremental addressable market. This also delivered improvements in empowerment and autonomy for the organization. Next, we centralized our technology development to leverage tech across the enterprise, increase speed and reduce redundancy.\nThird, we stood up an organization to help us better serve our customers throughout the entire lifecycle of our products and solutions. And lastly, we embraced a more disciplined capital allocation framework, focused on prioritizing the greatest opportunities for customer value unlocked; optimizing our business portfolio, which included exiting some unprofitable markets and product lines that didn't serve our strategy or create significant customer value and accelerating development and deployment of value-creating technologies.\nWe're confident when we create customer value, we're making their jobs and lives easier while enabling them to do more with less. And as a result, we will in turn grow and create value-adding margin accretive solutions. Our guide for 2024 contemplates our equipment operations being right around mid-cycle sales levels. As a result of our structural improvements combined with our execution, we will deliver nearly two times the margin and 2.5 times the net income than the last time our businesses were near mid-cycle in the 2018-2019 timeframe.\nIt's important to note that we'll achieve this level of profitability while continuing to protect our most important investments in products and services that further differentiate our customers. R&D and new product-related CapEx remains at the highest level in the company's history and we continue to invest in lifecycle solutions and business model transformation.\nFundamentally, we are operating very differently than in the past. As a result of these actions we've taken in executing the strategy and the significant opportunity in front of us, we are confident in our ability to produce higher levels of returns through cycle while dampening the variability in our performance over time. This will lead to higher highs and higher lows for our business. The runway of opportunity ahead of us is still greater than what we've unlocked to date, which gives us confidence in our strategy and enthusiasm to deliver for our customers and all stakeholders through the balance of the decade.\n\nJosh Rohleder - Manager of Investor Communications, John Deere\n\nThanks, Josh. Now, let's open it up to see what other questions are investors have. Now, we are all ready to begin the Q&A portion of the call. The operator will instruct you on the polling procedure. In consideration of others and our hope to allow more of you to participate in the call, please limit yourself to one question. If you have additional questions, we ask that you rejoin the queue.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. At this time, if you would like to ask a question, please ensure that your phone is on muted, press star 1 and record your name clearly when prompted. If you would need to withdraw your request, you may press star 2. That is star 1 to ask a question. One moment for our first question.\nOur first question is from Steve Volkmann with Jefferies. You may go ahead.\n\nStephen Volkmann - Jefferies LLC, Research Division\n\nGreat, good morning to all of the Joshes and Brent. My question is around kind of the cost side of this. Historically, I'd have been through a few cycles with you guys, I might have thought that there'd be more opportunity on the cost side relative to the sort of topline guide that you're giving. I'm calculating kind of a 35% decremental, I guess, that's kind of okay, but it feels like there should be some levers for you to pull to maybe mitigate that a little bit. So any thoughts around that, I'd love to hear.\n\nJosh Rohleder - Manager of Investor Communications, John Deere\n\nYeah, Hey, Steve, good morning. Thanks for the question. Regarding our cost management for 2024 and sort of the level of structural profitability embedded in the business, you'll see that some of our most profitable markets are down from a topline perspective. So Production and Precision AG will be down 15% to 20%, while at the same time maintaining a 35% decremental.\nAnd as we look at the execution in the fourth quarter, we're starting to see some of our disciplined cost management come into play. I mean, that's the first quarter in a number of years where we've seen production costs actually become deflationary and serve as a tailwind for our business. And I would say there's a significant agenda that we'll be executing towards for the remainder of 2024, but we are pleased to see the progress we've made already in the fourth quarter of '23.\nOur goal from a cost management perspective is to really neutralize all of the--to the extent possible--the production cost inflation in next year and where possible, actually drive some of that to a production cost deflation tailwind for us.\nIf you think about some of the areas where we're most focused, it's really around reducing costs in our supply chain, while at the same time increasing resiliency in the supply base. Over the longer term, we'll also work on designing cost out of our equipment. And so, if we break that down into some of the sub-components, we'll have opportunities both in raw material and freight costs, which were tailwinds for us in the back half of 2023. Those will continue to be tailwinds for us in 2024.\nAnd then logistics will be another area of focus and I think we're seeing that come down across, really, all forms of logistics from rail, ocean, trucking and air freight as well. If we go back to 2022, we saw our airfreight expense increase almost six-fold during that year and we got about half of that back in '23 and we'd look to get more of that back over the course of 2024.\n\nStephen Volkmann - Jefferies LLC, Research Division\n\nAnd just to be clear, you're expecting that within that 35% decremental, you're expecting kind of all of those pieces of goodness that you just described.\n\nJosh Rohleder - Manager of Investor Communications, John Deere\n\nYes. Certainly our guide would contemplate achieving further reductions and that's already included in our 35% decremental--there's certainly going to be opportunities to continue to control decrementals with further supply management and cost activities for 2024.\n\nJoshua Jepsen - Sr. VP & CFO, John Deere\n\nYes, Steve. Thank you, Josh. One thing I would add is, I mean, if we compare back to when periods when we've been at around mid-cycle--which we're projecting '24 will be--our margins will be nearly double, net income about 2.5 times greater. So, if you think about being around mid-cycle, delivering this decremental and significant improvement from a mid-cycle or mid-cycle perspective in profitability, we feel good about where we're at.\nWe have opportunities to keep working on and we will methodically work through those and as we execute, we'll see those benefits come through. But we feel good about where we're at from a guide perspective, we know we need to execute, but really, structurally, see a significant shift forward even just over the last five, six years. So, thank you. We'll go ahead and go to the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is from Stanley Elliott with Stifel. You may go ahead.\n\nStanley Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division\n\nGood morning, everyone. Can you talk a little bit about the implied pricing, is roughly kind of 1% coming off of difficult compares. Help us with maybe the exit rate into next year--or the end of this year or '24. Are we talking about negative pricing? Just any kind of help that you can provide there would be great.\n\nBrent Norwood - Head of Investor Relations, John Deere\n\nHey, good morning Stanley. Regarding our pricing strategy for 2024, we'll be at about a point and a half for both PPA and C&F and then a point for SAT. We will see some carryover early in the year but we would expect the entire year to remain positive for all three segments. Importantly, that forecast does include a return of some retail discounts so that is a net price realization figure. again inclusive of incentives.\nAnd I think what you've seen is--with Brazil being maybe the only notable exception--in most markets, we've really controlled our inventory position, which helps us protect our pricing strategy in most markets for 2024. So we wouldn't expect to see any segment go negative through the course of 2024. Thanks, Stanley.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question is from Seth Weber with Wells Fargo. You may go ahead.\n\nSeth Weber - Wells Fargo Securities, Research Division\n\nHey, guys. Good morning and happy Thanksgiving. I wanted to see if you could just give a little bit of context around your guidance for P&PA and the other segments, where your growth is expected to be--your decline is expected to be bigger than the industry declines. If you could just maybe contextualize that for us, like why there would be underperforming, what you're calling for for the industry and markets. Thanks.\n\nJosh Rohleder - Manager of Investor Communications, John Deere\n\nYeah, happy Thanksgiving to you to Seth. Regarding our guide--our financial guide relative to our industry forecast, you'll notice some slight differences between the segments, maybe starting with Production and Precision AG. In North America, we have positioned ourselves really well and we will be able to produce in line with retail demand for 2024. Where you're seeing our financial guide a little bit lower than our broader industry guide is really due to Brazil, where we will be underproducing retail demand in 2024, as we work to bring inventory levels back to our targeted levels for that particular market.\nSo that's really what's affecting our financial guide relative to the industry guide for Production and Precision AG. For Small AG and Turf, the story there continues to be around small tractors, our compact utility tractors, where we'll see another year of underproduction to bring inventory levels back down a little bit. That market continues to be affected by the slowdown in single family housing starts and can also be relatively sensitive to interest rate increases. And so as that end market continues to be slow, we'll under produce yet another year in 2024. I would say for the rest of Small AG and Turf, we'll have the ability to produce largely in line with the industry.\nAs it relates to construction and forestry, the story there is a little bit different. You saw the industry at large, build inventory in 2023. We did build some inventory, but certainly not at the pace that the broader industry did. And so we actually may have a little further inventory build yet to come in 2024 but it will be an inventory build at to a lesser extent than what happened in 2023, so that will drive lower shipment volumes year-over-year relative to the industry there. So it's a little bit different story, depending on what segment we're talking about, but that's the reconciliation--the broad reconciliation of our financial guide to the industry.\n\nJoshua Jepsen - Sr. VP & CFO, John Deere\n\nYes Seth, Josh, just maybe one thing to add is just to reiterate the position in North America on the Large AG side, we've managed that very well and very different than the prior cycle. I think both new and used were really well-positioned, as Brent mentioned, booked to build in line with retail as we go forward, but the work that's been done on the new side. We highlighted earlier, but for example--new inventory on combines, inventory sales, 4% at the end of the year, four-wheel drive tractors, 9% or something like 15% on row crop.\nSo both the new side and then what the dealers have done working through use proactively--and we've supported that activity--has been has been really positive and positioned us well when you think about our biggest market. Thanks, Seth. We're going go to the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question is from Tim Thein with Citigroup. You may go ahead.\n\nTim Thein - Analyst, CITI\n\nThank you, good morning. Maybe just coming back to the comment on production costs and I guess it's a bit more of a clarification. I thought I heard you state earlier that you expect production cost to be favorable overall for the company in '24, but then later, it sounded like maybe there are pieces of it that you expected to be favorable. So, just so we're on the same page in terms of the EBIT bridge that you provide by segment, that production costs for the company as a whole--you expect that to be on the plus side throughout '24? Is that correct or is that--did I mishear that? Thanks.\n\nBrent Norwood - Head of Investor Relations, John Deere\n\nRegarding production cost for 2024, our guide would contemplate production cost to be flat to a tailwind next year. A slight tailwind, I should say. There are some sub-components within production costs that will still be inflationary, but net net we should be moderately positive in the year 2024. Specifically, we would expect tailwind to come from further material and freight reductions in 2024 when compared to 2023.\nLabor would be the largest inflationary item within the production cost bucket for us. And what we're seeing is contract--many of the labor contracts that we have within our factories do have scheduled step ups in the year. So we'll have to offset those to bring total production cost to a deflationary state in 2024, which again our guide doesn't contemplate.\n\nJoshua Jepsen - Sr. VP & CFO, John Deere\n\nYeah. I mean, in short, Tim, you add up those those bars for production costs--they should be green, is our current expectation for production cost in '24. Thanks, Tim.\n\nTim Thein - Analyst, CITI\n\nYeah, got it. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question is from Kristen Owen with Oppenheimer. You may go ahead.\n\nKristen Owen - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division\n\nGreat. Thank you so much for taking the questions and happy Thanksgiving. I wanted to ask on the broader capital allocation question--just given the outlook, you've got operating cash flow conversion greater than 100% guided in 2024 and so my question is twofold. First , on the internal investments. Can you talk about the technology spend through the cycle and how you're prioritizing that project. And then externally, maybe touch on the dividends given the 25% to 35% payout ratio at mid-cycle, how we should think about that influencing your dividend outlook next year. Thank you.\n\nJoshua Jepsen - Sr. VP & CFO, John Deere\n\nHey, Kristen. It's Josh. Thank you for the question. I'll start with the R&D side. So yeah, we'll be up slightly from an R&D perspective, so we're talking $2.2 billion or more. A tremendous amount of that continues to be focused on what we're doing from a technology perspective and bringing certain AG technologies across our portfolio, across the enterprise. Autonomy, significant opportunities there and as Brent mentioned, we saw good progress this year there as well.\nAnd we have significant opportunities there, we spoke to a dealer principal a week ago and we talked about being out with customers here over the last month and every single customer across many different crops and production systems, all asking about autonomy. So we know the appetite there and the labor challenges being faced by our customer base, so that remains very real. And we also have some significant new product development coming, where we're integrating hardware and technology over the course of the next couple of years. So there's a tremendous amount of focus from an R&D perspective on that.",
        "content3": "And as you've heard us talk about before, we're continuing to think about alternative propulsion solutions that are going to reduce emissions and reduce cost for our customers and we've got to focus in that space, for sure. As it relates to the dividend, we've mentioned we've taken it up nearly 20% this year. I think that underlies the confidence we have in where we are and where we're going as it relates to our payout percentage in the range. We're still working our way to that range, to the bottom of that and recognize over time, as we continue to execute the way we are, that range will continue to move.\nSo, that is something we likely chase as we demonstrate and deliver continued structural profitability. But I would say, all in all, given the cash we expect to generate, we'll be able to handle all of our use cash priorities from investing in the business, organic and inorganic, the dividend, as well as using residual cash to repurchase shares. And we think over the long term, we can drive value-enhancing actions there. Thanks, Kristen. We'll go ahead and jump to our next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question is from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. You may go ahead.\n\nJerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division\n\nYes, hi. Good morning everyone and happy Thanksgiving. Nice to see the production cut in the business before used inventories got out of hand the way they did in prior cycles. I'm wondering if you could just unpack the 15% to 20% production cut in Large AG and how you're thinking that will drive a balancing in used inventories, because obviously used inventories are at absolute low level, but rising rapidly off the bottom. So what's the level of comfort based on your modeling that the 50% to 20% cut is going to get us where we need to be versus needing to cut production further if used inventories continued to build. We'd love to hear how you're thinking about all of that.\n\nBrent Norwood - Head of Investor Relations, John Deere\n\nYes. Good morning, Gerry and happy Thanksgiving to you as well. There's a couple of puts and takes as we think about production for next year. Certainly, we and the industry at large have benefited from some of the production constraints over 2021 and '22 and '23. Certainly didn't feel like a net benefit during those years but the constraints that we faced as an industry during that time period, limited the amount of new equipment that we introduced to the fleet in a short period of time. And I think ultimately, we'll see that have a dampening effect on the cycle itself.\nAs it relates to used, we have seen used get depleted significantly during those lean years in '22 and the first part of '23. Some of those used inventories have started to come back up in the early part of 2023 and this is where the dealer response has been really phenomenal in terms of their their proactive engagement to keep those used inventories well below historic target averages. And so we look at combines--I think 40% below the historic average there and tractors were around 20% below the historic average.\nPart of that was again, our dealers being proactive, but then also in the back half of 2023, we did increase our incentive spend on used to help dealers manage that used inventory. And I think the other part of the story here is just around how we've changed some of our leasing options relative to the last cycle.\nIf we go back to 2012 and '13 and 14, John Deere and the industry at large, was engaging in a lot of short term leases that produced machines coming back to OEMs within one or two years. And that exacerbated some of the used inventory balances that we saw at the end of the cycle. And so as we intend to produce in line for new next year, combined with better inventory management on the side, we think that balance of new and used should be relatively healthy going into 2024. Thanks Jerry.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question is from Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research. You may go ahead.\n\nRob Wertheimer - Founding Partner and Machinery Analyst, Melius Research\n\nHi, thank you. I just wanted to circle back to decremental margins in Large AG. I think the Production Precision is more like 38 versus 35, obviously not a huge difference, but I was curious if there's any mix headwind within that segment or R&D. And actually curious how you interpret what sounds like a more negative kind of combine Early Order Program versus some of the others. Is that a shift in time, is that a combine specific cycle, is that--how do you interpret that differential if there is one and is that kind of what's dragging down the margin. Thank you. And the outlook.\n\nBrent Norwood - Head of Investor Relations, John Deere\n\nYes. Thanks, Rob for the question. Regarding our decrementals for next year, I mean, there's a number of things to get to see there. We are seeing a significant double digit volume decline in our shipments, while at the same time, we've held our R&D investment relatively flat to up a little bit next year as we intend to invest somewhat consistently through cycle here.\nAs you think about sort of the mix impact that we're having on our decremental, certainly with combines down more than the group average, that's certainly a little bit of a negative mix headwind there. And I would say over the last few years, we've seen profitability in Brazil approach our North America margins, and so that market being down more than the entire segment average also has a little bit of a mix headwind. And this is where our focus on cost management is really helping us maintain our traditional decrementals because with those mix headwinds, it would be difficult to do otherwise.\nSpecific to combines, in terms of why is that down more than the group segment, combines have a slightly shorter useful life than other pieces of farm equipment. And so over the last two to three years, we saw the fleet age come down more in combines than tractors. And right now the fleet age is about in line with long-term averages and so I think that's given producers a little more discretion on their combine CapEx decisions going into next year.\n\nJoshua Jepsen - Sr. VP & CFO, John Deere\n\nRob, great question, this is Josh. One thing to add, at the same time Brent mentioned R&D, we're also investing in parts of the business like our business model transformation and how we build out the go to market plans there. Over time, we expect that will drive more stable business better, margin as we deliver on that and grow that at scale. I think in the near-term, we're building that and investing in it knowing the benefits that can deliver here as we go through the balance of the decade. Thanks, Rob.\n\nJosh Rohleder - Manager of Investor Communications, John Deere\n\nAnd [inaudible], I think we have time for one last caller.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our last question comes from Mike Shlisky with DA Davidson. You may go ahead.\n\nMike Shlisky - Managing Director & Senior Equity Research Analyst, D.A. Davidson\n\nHi. Good morning and happy Thanksgiving and thanks for taking my question here. I'll ask a very simple one. Just a little more granularity on your comments about this being a mid-cycle year in 2024, I guess I wanted to know are all three segments are going to be at mid-cycle for this fiscal 2024? The margins for each segment should also be about--it should be at mid-cycle as well. Just kind of your thoughts on whether any segment will be below or above mid-cycle. balanced out by the other one. Thank you.\n\nBrent Norwood - Head of Investor Relations, John Deere\n\nHey, Mike. Happy Thanksgiving to you as well. I would say broadly, segments are somewhat close to mid-cycle. I think Production and Precision AG is probably the closest construction forestry running a little bit higher and Small AG and Turf a little bit lower is sort of a directional breakdown there. I think for us, as we think about structural profitability, we measure that at similar points in the cycle across a long period of time. And so for us, we look at 2024 as a good proxy for mid-cycle.\nWe would compare that to 2019, would be the last year our businesses were running around the same level of volume and so we're pleased that we can generate 2.5x the net income at these levels. And given the mix, if most of them are closer to mid-cycle then we feel like it's a pretty good example of what we can deliver at mid-cycle volumes.\n\nJoshua Jepsen - Sr. VP & CFO, John Deere\n\nYes, Mike, this is Josh. I think just maybe to add on what Brent mentioned, I think importantly here--what we can deliver here at near mid-cycle is fundamentally different than how we performed in the past. So, we're talking about roughly $8 billion of net income, $28, $29 of EPS. You can compare that back to 2013, a period we often get compared to and we are significantly better than that point in time. And I think that's important because you're seeing a significant shift in terms of how do we perform mid-cycle, obviously, you saw how we performed in '23. I think the implication is at the bottom of the cycle, we would expect to perform significantly better than we have in the past as well.\nSo, we're excited about the opportunities ahead of us. It's not just around how we manage the cycle because we see more opportunity for growth, from our ability to create value for customers through technology, as well as reducing volatility for both customers and their operations and for Deere. So there's a tremendous amount of room for us over the balance of the decade to continue improving.\n\nJosh Rohleder - Manager of Investor Communications, John Deere\n\nThat concludes today's calls. We appreciate everyone's time and hope you all have a great Thanksgiving.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. That does conclude today's conference. Thank you all for participating, you may disconnect at this time."

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Brent Norwood, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, sir. You may begin.\n\nBrent Norwood\n\nDirector of Investor Relations\n\nHello. Also on the call today are Josh Jepsen, Chief Financial Officer; and Josh Rohleder, Manager of Investor Communications. Today, we'll take a closer look at Deere's third quarter earnings, then spend some time talking about our markets and our current outlook for fiscal year 2023. After that, we'll respond to your questions.\nPlease note that slides are available to complement the call this morning. They can be accessed on our website at johndeere.com/earnings.\nFirst, a reminder. This call is being broadcast live on the Internet and recorded for future transmission and use by Deere & Company.

Additional information concerning these measures, including reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures, is included in the release and posted on our website at johndeere.com/earnings under Quarterly Earnings and Events.\nI will now turn the call over to Josh Rohleder.\n\nJosh Rohleder\n\nGood morning, and thank you all for joining. John Deere finished the third quarter with another strong performance, resulting in 22.6% margin for equipment operations performance exceeded expectations as a result of sustained demand for both farm and construction equipment as well as sound operational execution across all business units.\nAg fundamentals continue to remain healthy with a full order book and positive customer sentiment supporting a strong finish to fiscal year 2023. Meanwhile, Construction & Forestry remains sold out for the remainder of the fiscal year with robust shipments driven by strong retail demand and rental refleeting.\nSlide 3 begins with results for the third quarter. Net sales and revenues were up 12% to $15.801 billion, while net sales for the equipment operations were up 10% to $14.284 billion. Net income attributable to Deere & Company was $2.978 billion or $10.20 per diluted share. Third quarter net income results included a $243 million tax benefit and a $47 million of associated interest income stemming from a favorable tax ruling on Brazilian VAT tax subsidies.\nTurning now to Slide 4. Let's begin our segment review with the Production and Precision Ag business. Net sales of $6.806 billion were up 12% compared to the third quarter last year, primarily due to price realization. Price realization for the quarter was positive by just under 12 points. Currency translation was also positive by approximately 1 point.\nOperating profit was $1.782 billion resulting in a 26.2% operating margin for the quarter. The year-over-year increase was driven by favorable price realization, improved shipment volumes and favorable sales mix, which was partially offset by higher production costs, increased SA&G and R&D spending and unfavorable currency exchange.\nShifting to Small Ag and Turf on Slide 5. Net sales were up 3%, totaling $3.739 billion in the third quarter. The increase was a result of price realization, which was partially offset by lower shipment volumes. Price realization was positive by slightly over 9 points. Currency was also positive by slightly under 0.5 point. Operating profit improved year-over-year to $732 million, resulting in a 19.6% operating margin. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to price realization and was partially offset by higher production costs lower shipment volumes and increased SA&G and R&D spending.\nSlide 6 shows our industry outlook for Ag and Turf markets globally. In the U.S. and Canada, we expect industry sales of large ag equipment to be up approximately 10% during the fiscal year, reflecting a continuation of strong demand. Ag fundamentals remain solid with farm net income expected to be near historical highs even if down from last year's record levels. Drier weather conditions over the summer put some downward pressure on yields, tightening ending grain stock estimates and further supporting commodity prices.\nSolid order visibility provides a high level of confidence as we move into the fourth quarter. Within Small Ag and Turf, we estimate industry sales in the U.S. and Canada to be down between 5% and 10% and as strength from midsized equipment continues to be offset by weaker consumer-oriented products, which have been pulled down in part by high interest rates. Midsized tractors in the 100 to 180-horsepower range are sold out for the remainder of the year, while production cuts in the sub 40-horsepower compact tractor range have helped to bring inventory levels down from April highs. Pay and forge continues to see significant year-over-year increases as production shortages in 2022 fully abate.\nTurning to Europe. The industry is forecasted to be flat to up 5% for fiscal year 2023. Our visibility for the rest of 2023 remains excellent as order books are largely presold at this point in the year. In South America, we expect industry sales of tractors and combines to be flat to down 5% following a record year of equipment in 2022. Positive sentiment around record grain production in 2023 was somewhat offset by political uncertainty and a delayed government-sponsored financing plan. The market remains stable and order books now provide visibility through the remainder of 2023. Industry sales in Asia are forecasted to be down moderately as volumes in India remained subdued when compared to record levels in 2021.\nMoving now to segment forecast on Slide 7. For Production and Precision Ag, net sales continue to be forecasted up around 20% for the fiscal year. The forecast assumes a roughly 15 points of positive price realization for the full year and minimal currency impact. Segment operating margin for the year remains between 25% and 26%, reflecting strong execution globally.\nSlide 8 gives our forecast for the Small Ag and Turf segment. Net sales are expected to remain up around 5% in fiscal year 2023. Guidance includes about 9 points of positive price realization and approximately 1 point of currency headwind. The segment's projected operating margin is now between 17% and 18%, and reflecting stronger-than-expected operational efficiency, notably in Europe.\nNow switching to Construction and Forestry on Slide 9. Net sales for the quarter were $3.739 billion, up 14%, primarily due to price realization and higher shipment volumes. Price realization was positive by nearly 10 points and currency translation was also positive by approximately 0.5 point. Operating profit increased year-over-year to $76 million, resulting in a 19.1% operating margin due to price realization and improved shipment volumes. These were partially offset by increased SA&G and R&D expenses, higher production costs and unfavorable currency impact.\nSlide 10 shows our 2023 industry outlook for Construction and Forestry. Industry sales of earth moving and compact construction equipment in North America are both projected to remain flat to up 5%. Demand for earthmoving and compact construction equipment remains robust, driven primarily by the early stages of infrastructure spending and rental refleeting. After that the industry also benefited from stabilization and housing as well as reshoring efforts in our sector which are helping to offset [indiscernible] real estate. In forestry, we estimate global industry will be flat to down 5%, with growth in Europe [indiscernible]. Global road building markets are forecasted to be flat 5%. Strong performance in North America, emerging markets and South America and India are supporting strong fundamentals across Europe.\nContinuing on with the C&F segment outlook on Slide 11. Deere's Construction and Forestry 202 net sales are now forecasted between 15% and 20%, with the results likely to converge towards the middle of that range. Our net sales guidance for the year considers about 11 points of positive price realization. Operating margin is now expected to be in the range of between 18.5% to 19.5%.\nNext, we'll transition to our financial services operations on Slide 12. Worldwide Financial Services net income attributable to Deere & Company in the third quarter was $216 million. The 3% year-over-year increase was due to the income earned and a higher average portfolio, partially offset by less favorite financing spreads.\nFor fiscal year 2023, our outlook remains at $630 million, reflecting less favorable financing spreads, the second quarter correction of the accounting treatment for financing incentives, a higher provision for credit losses increased SA&G expenses and lower gains on operating lease dispositions. These were partially offset by benefits from a higher average portfolio balance.\nFinally, Slide 13 outlines our guidance for net income, effective tax rate and operating cash flow. For fiscal year '23, we are raising our outlook for net income by $0.5 billion to be between $9.75 billion and $10 billion. reflecting another quarter of strong results and continued optimism for the remainder of the year.\nNext, our guidance incorporates an updated effective tax rate between 21% and 23% and which reflects the impact of a favorable tax ruling in Brazil, as mentioned earlier. Lastly, cash flow from equipment operations is now projected to be in the range of $10.5 billion to $11 billion.\nThis concludes our formal remarks. We will now turn to a few specific topics relevant to the quarter before opening the line for Q&A. Let's begin with Deere's performance this quarter, Brent. We had another really strong quarter with operational results coming in just ahead of our own expectations. Net sales for equipment operations were up 10% year-over-year. while operating margins came in at 22.6% for the quarter. Can you break down what went well for us this quarter?\n\nBrent Norwood\n\nDirector of Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Josh. First, our factories ran really well in the third quarter. We saw continued progress from our supply base, enabling our operations to hit production schedules almost exactly as planned. This precise execution from our factories is evident in our top line quarterly cadence, which will show a return to normal seasonality in 2023 when compared to 2022.\nAnd a return to normal seasonality is incredibly important to us because it means that we are delivering on our cost customer commitments to get the machines in season. Importantly, this is a real testament to our factory teams. And the real story, as you alluded to, is around margins, right? All 3 divisions saw lower-than-expected production cost inflation as our operational teams continue to deliver on cost reduction activities, having eliminated many of the inflationary and disruption-driven costs over the last couple of years.\nThis was especially notable for Construction & Forestry, which delivered record year-to-date margin performance. In addition to exceptional near-term execution, Construction & Forestry is also benefiting from executing on our business strategy, as shown by our successful integration of Wirtgen, the dissolution of our Deere Hitachi joint venture and the strategic portfolio actions that have helped us focus the business.\nAs it relates to the quarter, these results underpin our commitment to operational excellence. With supply chains continuing to improve, we have been able to reduce delinquencies and improve resiliency in our supply base. In premium freight alone, we've been able to reduce costs by nearly 50% this year when compared to last year. From a production standpoint, we've seen material cost inflation come down meaningfully throughout the year. We expect this trend to continue throughout the rest of the year.\nAnd when you successfully execute on all of these different initiatives simultaneously, you get factories that fundamentally run better. Across the board, we're seeing smoother operations, leaner in-process inventories and better ability to meet our delivery commitments, which ultimately lead to a better customer experience.\n\nJosh Rohleder\n\nThat's great. Thanks, Brent. With operations running much more smoothly, maybe we can flip to the other side of the equation. There's been a large amount of focus on industry fundamentals, both from a construction and an ag perspective. I'd like to start with construction equipment. We've seen record amounts of government funding announced in the past few years. Alongside the IIJA and Ships Act, the IRA has already announced more than $130 billion worth of clean energy projects. How are construction fundamentals faring today?\n\nBrent Norwood\n\nDirector of Investor Relations\n\nYes. That's great context, Josh. Earthmoving industry fundamentals remain quite strong, driven by construction job growth across most sectors and in particular, large infrastructure project spending. Coupled with continued rental industry refleeting, demand is expected to remain steady throughout the remainder of the year. And while we see nice tailwinds from mega project spending tied to government funds. Most of these projects will primarily benefit 2024 and potentially even 2025, supporting an elongated cycle for construction equipment sales.\nIn the near term, the residential housing market, while down from the highs in 2021 has stabilized despite elevated interest rates. For nonres demand, reshoring trends are driving manufacturing projects, while sectors linked to office space and apartment building construction remain quite sluggish. Ultimately, this demand backdrop translates to a strong 6-month rolling order book extending into the second quarter of 2024. And finally, while we have had some success increasing inventory from historic lows, inventory to sales ratios still remain well below target levels.\n\nJosh Rohleder\n\nOkay. That's perfect. So near-term construction fundamentals remain resilient, and the business appears to be very well positioned on the construction side heading into 2024. We Focusing now on ag fundamentals. Farmers are expected to have another strong year relative to historicals. WASDE just released its latest forecast last week, showing crop yields down and stocks tightening. How should we be thinking about farmer fundamentals, Brent?\n\nBrent Norwood\n\nDirector of Investor Relations\n\nGrain prices have definitely seen a large amount of volatility this year, but equipment demand has remained strong, particularly for large ag. While down year-over-year, crop prices are forecasted to be the third highest in over a decade. And in North America, farmers are projected to have another year of healthy net income.\nAdditionally, farm inputs have trended back down to pre-COVID levels, providing a benefit to next year's for margins. And finally, as grain production remains subject to ever volatile weather patterns and adverse geopolitical events. Expect stocks to use to remain tighter for a bit longer.\nSo in summary, ag fundamentals are still supportive in the North American market. Farmers will continue to see relatively healthy economics supported by downward trending input cost and continued constraint on grain supplies globally.\n\nJosh Rohleder\n\nThanks, Brent. That's great color on the U.S. and Canada. If we look outside North America, how will we see these fundamentals impacting Brazil?\n\nBrent Norwood\n\nDirector of Investor Relations\n\nYes. Brazil has been a real dynamic market this year. Earlier in the year, we saw some of the political uncertainty and the delayed government-sponsored financing plans weigh on sentiment. While profitability has been very good generated lower-than-expected income due to lower grain prices combined with a strengthening Brazilian currency relative to the U.S. dollar. As such, we saw the industry forecast come in a bit. And as a result, we trimmed our equipment production some in the back half of 2023. At this point, the order book extends through the fiscal year and our presold position is robust eclipsing 90% for combines.\n\nJosh Jepsen\n\nHead of IR, John Deere Capital Corporation\n\nBrent, this is Josh Jepsen. Just to add to that, Brazil still experienced record production this year. We're seeing continued acreage expansion and a supportive government-sponsored financing programs now in place. So long term, Brazil remains a key market for us. that we'll continue to invest in for the future as we accelerate precision technologies in the region.\n\nJosh Rohleder\n\nThanks, Josh. Now switching back to the North American market. With order books full through the end of the year, how our new field inventory levels shaping up as we exit 2023 and begin planning for '24?\n\nBrent Norwood\n\nDirector of Investor Relations\n\nThat's a great question, Josh. Starting from the top, all of our North America large ag production is sold out for this year. We expect ending year-over-year changes in new field inventory to be modest. In-season inventory increases have largely corresponded to our quarterly production schedules, which will come down in the fourth quarter.\nCombined inventory, for example, saw its highest level in the second quarter and is currently down from its peak. We will see that figure step down further in connection with seasonal retail activity ahead of harvest. And while high horsepower tractor inventory remains sequentially flattish in the third quarter, we'll see that drop off at the end of the fourth quarter, which is typically the highest retail quarter for tractors. Keep in mind that combines and high horsepower tractors are 95% plus retail sold to customers already.\n\nJosh Rohleder\n\nPerfect. So we will expect to see inventories wind down further throughout the fourth quarter. Now what about used inventories? We've seen those rise pretty significantly year-over-year from their historic lows last year.\n\nBrent Norwood\n\nDirector of Investor Relations\n\nWe have. But the key phrase here is historic lows last year. When you are starting with a historically small existing inventory base like we had in 2022, even modest changes in units will reflect large percentage increases. That said, our dealers have been watching used inventories very closely and have been managing them proactively. Large ag equipment has roughly 4 to 5 owners over its useful life in North America. So for every combine or tractor we sell, a dealer will typically facilitate 3 to 4 additional transactions as use equipment works its way down the trade ladder.\nNow when you put it in the context of my previous comments around new inventory, it would make sense that we saw inventory levels rise during the middle part of the calendar year. However, if we look at used combines, for example, we saw a 10% decrease in used inventory since May. Also, August tends to be an important month for used inventory. So we'll watch closely how that trends. Importantly, used gear inventory for both combines and tractors remains about 20% lower than the 7-year average on a unit basis.\n\nJosh Jepsen\n\nHead of IR, John Deere Capital Corporation\n\nThis is Josh. Maybe one thing to highlight. Just I think the important takeaway here is that by year-end, we expect both new and used inventory levels to be below historic levels on a unit basis. So really position us well as we exit '23 into '24.\n\nJosh Rohleder\n\nPerfect. But how are we doing from an EOP perspective in North America?\n\nBrent Norwood\n\nDirector of Investor Relations\n\nAt this point, we've kicked off, and in some cases, closed our early order programs for a few product lines. I want to caveat here that it is still early. And while we don't have a fully formed view, the early order programs are giving us some early data points. We launched our sprayer EOP back in May, and the program ended July 31. The we have sold out all of our model year '24 production slots with unit sales up double digits when compared to model year '23 sprayers.\nThe 2024 year-over-year increase reflects improved supply conditions which had disproportionately limited sprayer production in 2023. Phase 2 of planters opened in mid-July and has just under 2 weeks left to go in the program. orders are relatively flat compared to the same point in time as the program last year and down 5% relative to the end of last year's EOP. However, we won't have the final read on this year's early order program until the end of August.\nImportantly, we are seeing favorable mix towards our larger planters and higher take rates on technology. Our combine early order program just opened at the beginning of this month and has gotten off to a nice start, but it remains too early to extrapolate any data points for 2024 as the program will continue through the end of November. Likewise, our tractor order book has just opened this week for 2Q '24, and we have not had -- we don't have any data points to share at this time. I would note, however, that the order book is currently full through the calendar year '24.\n\nJosh Rohleder\n\nThanks for the color on North America, Brent. Clearly, too early to tell here, but it sounds like preliminary data is supportive. To round out our discussion, can we focus on Europe and discuss how things are shaping up there for next year?\n\nBrent Norwood\n\nDirector of Investor Relations\n\nYes, absolutely. And actually, Josh, I just want to amend my prior statement, tractors are sold out through calendar year '23, not to '24. In Europe, However, order books are stretching into the second quarter of 2024, providing decent visibility, but with some early order programs having just kicked off, it remains too early to form a view on 2024 outlook. Expect markets in Europe to remain dynamic with outlooks varying a bit between Western Europe versus Central and Eastern markets.\nWestern markets are seeing arable cash margins are seeing arable cash flow stabilize at supportive levels while declining input cost will help buttress financials going into next year. Meanwhile, dairy margins may see some pressure in 2024. On the other hand, markets with close proximity to Ukraine will contend with lower commodity prices as reduced port access means grains are flowing over neighboring borders pressuring local prices. All in, expect Europe to remain a dynamic market going into 2024, and we'll have a more informed view as we get closer to the start of our fiscal year.\n\nJosh Jepsen\n\nHead of IR, John Deere Capital Corporation\n\nAnd one point I'd add to highlight in Europe is our dealer network, we continue to see higher levels of sales flowing through dealers of scale. This has driven better market share, higher rates of precision ag adoption and overall stronger businesses for our dealers and Deere.\n\nJosh Rohleder\n\nPerfect. That's great insight. I now I have one last question for you, Josh. Given the high level of cash flow this year, we've had an opportunity to execute on all elements of our capital allocation priorities. Can you walk through some of the decisions we've made this year with respect to funding further investments in our business, both organic and inorganic, while at the same time returning higher levels of capital back to investors?\n\nJosh Jepsen\n\nHead of IR, John Deere Capital Corporation\n\nGreat question, Josh. This is, first and foremost, a direct reflection of the strong performance this year, which is projected to yield between $10.5 billion and $11 billion in operating cash flow for the equipment operations. We're very proud of what we've been able to accomplish this year and are encouraged by our ability to both invest aggressively in the business while at the same time returning a significant amount of earnings to our shareholders.",
        "content2": "During the year, we've increased R&D 15%. We pulled ahead some CapEx projects into 2023 and is still managed to simultaneously deliver over $5.5 billion to shareholders year-to-date through dividends and share repurchases. It further reinforces our excitement for the future and the opportunities we see ahead as we execute on the strategy, unlocking value for customers.\n\nJosh Rohleder\n\nThanks, Josh. And before we open up the line for questions, do you have any final thoughts you'd like to share?\n\nJosh Jepsen\n\nHead of IR, John Deere Capital Corporation\n\nYes. Thanks. As previously noted, the team is executing at a high level in 2023, which is evident in our results. We're actively working to reduce some of the inflationary and disruption costs experienced over the past couple of years, and we expect to see that benefit continue. Over the last decade, we've been on a journey to deliver more value per unit. This is clearly visible today through our higher revenues on lower new units, making us less dependent on new unit sales to drive increased levels of performance.\nAs we continue to execute our strategy, this trend should accelerate even faster over the coming years. By utilizing our production systems approach and leveraging the tech stack, we can help our customers do their jobs more profitably and sustainably. That is our purpose, and we are more excited about it each day.\n\nJosh Rohleder\n\nThanks, Josh. Now let's open up the line for questions from our investors."

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Brent Norwood, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.\n\nBrent Norwood\n\nDirector of Investor Relations\n\nHello. Also on the call today are Josh Jepsen, Chief Financial Officer; Dave Gilmore, Senior Vice President, Ag and Turf Sales and Marketing. Kanlaya Barr, Director of Corporate Economics; and Rachel Bach, Manager of Investor Communications.\nToday, we'll take a closer look at Deere's second quarter earnings, then spend some time talking about our markets and our current outlook for fiscal year 2023. After that, we'll respond to your questions.\nPlease note that slides are available to complement the call this morning.

Additional information concerning these measures, including reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures, is included in the release and posted on our website at johndeere.com/earnings under Quarterly Earnings and Events.\nI will now turn the call over to Rachel Bach.\n\nRachel Bach\n\nGood morning, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. John Deere completed the second quarter with strong performance. Financial results for the quarter included 24% margin for equipment operations. Across our businesses, outperformance was driven by strong demand, favorable pricing and operational execution enabled by supply chain improvements. Our fundamentals remain healthy, providing a strong second half of fiscal year 2023 and support an order backlog that extends throughout the fiscal year.\nLikewise, the Construction & Forestry division continues to benefit from healthy demand with order books virtually full for the remainder of the fiscal year.\nSlide 3 begins with the results for the second quarter. Net sales and revenues were up 30% to $17.387 billion, while net sales for the equipment operations were up 34% to $16.079 billion. Net income attributable to Deere & Company was $2.86 billion or $9.65 per diluted share. Taking a closer look at the individual segments, we begin with the production and precision ag business on Slide 4.\nNet sales of $7.822 billion were up 53% compared to the second quarter last year, and, in fact, more than our own forecast, primarily due to increased shipment volumes and price realization. Price realization was positive by about 20 points. We expect price realization to normalize as inflation continues to subside. Currency translation was negative by approximately 3 points.\nOperating profit was $2.17 billion, resulting in a 27.7% operating margin. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to favorable price realization and improved shipment volume. These were partially offset by increased R&D and SA&G spending, higher production costs and unfavorable foreign currency exchange.\nPrior year results were negatively impacted by an impairment of $46 million related to events in Russia and Ukraine.\nMoving to Small Ag and Turf on Slide 5. Net sales were up 16%, and totaling $4.45 billion in the second quarter as a result of price realization and higher shipment volumes, partially offset by negative currency translation. Price realization was positive by just over 12 points while currency was negative by roughly 2 points.\nOperating profit was improved year-over-year at $849 million, resulting in a 20.5% operating margin. The increased profit was primarily due to price realization and to a lesser extent, higher shipment volumes and mix, which were partially offset by higher production costs, R&D and SA&G and negative currency translation.\nSlide 6 covers our industry outlook for ag and turf markets globally. We expect industry sales of large ag equipment in U.S. and Canada to be up approximately 10%, reflecting another year of strong demand. We've seen continued industry theme since last quarter with strong ag fundamentals, a historically high fleet age and low field inventory from prior year supply constraints. We expect elevated demand to continue for the back half of the year as evidenced by an order bank that extends into fiscal year '24.\nFor Small Ag and Turf, we estimate industry sales in the U.S. and Canada to be down around 5% as strength for midsized equipment is offset by weakness in more consumer-oriented products. Demand for compact tractors has declined year-over-year, resulting in inventory levels rising to pre-COVID levels. Meanwhile, Hay and Forge segment remained strong, driving demand for products like our 100- to 180-horsepower tractors, wind rowers and round balers.\nMoving on to Europe. The industry is forecasted to be flat to up 5%. Commodity prices have softened from near all-time highs in recent months, but farm input prices are coming down as well. As a result, arable cash flow is normalizing from recent peaks, but still above average and continuing to drive demand for the rest of the year.\nIn South America, we expect industry sales of tractors and combines to be flat holding strong relative to historical levels. Ag fundamentals remain solid in Brazil, but markets have tempered by delays in government sponsoring sponsored financing programs for small ag producers. Meanwhile, Argentina continues to grapple with a historic drought, which has significantly pressured yields for the year.\nIndustry sales in Asia are forecasted to be down moderately. Now digging into the segment forecast beginning on Slide 7. For production in Precision Ag, net sales continue to be forecasted up around 20% for the full year. The forecast assumes about 15 points of positive price realization for the full year and minimal currency impact.\nAs noted last quarter, we expect price realization to moderate in the latter half of the fiscal year relative to our reported first 6 months. For the segment's operating margin, our full year forecast is now between 25% and 26%.\nSlide 8 shows our forecast for the Small Ag and Turf segment. We now expect net sales to be up around 5% in fiscal year '23. This guidance includes about 9 points of positive price realization and just over 0.5 point of currency headwind. The segment's operating margin is now projected to be between 15.5% and 16.5%.\nWith that, we'll turn to Construction & Forestry on Slide 9. Net sales for the quarter were $4.112 billion, up 23%, primarily due to price realization and improved shipment volumes. Price realization was positive by nearly 13 points while currency translation was negative by approximately 1.5 points. Operating profit increased year-over-year to $838 million, resulting in a 20.4% operating margin due to price realization and higher shipment volumes and mix, partially offset by higher production costs and increased SAG and R&D expenses.\nWhen comparing to last year, keep in mind, the prior period results included a non-repeating net benefit of $279 million, mostly driven by a gain on the previously held equity investment in the Deere Hitachi joint venture.\nSlide 10 shows our 2023 Construction forestry industry outlook. Industry sales of earthmoving and compact construction equipment in North America are both projected to remain flat to up 5%. End markets for earthmoving and compact equipment remained relatively stable. While the commercial real estate and office segments weakened, the oil and gas sector is leveling and housing starts appear to have bottomed. Headwinds from year-over-year declines in residential and commercial have been more than offset by strong U.S. infrastructure spending and rental inventory restocking.\nImportantly, dealer inventory remains below historical averages. In forestry, we estimate the global industry will be flat as the U.S. and Canada markets continue to soften, while Europe continues to grow. Global road building markets are forecasted to be flat North America remains the strongest market, compensating for sluggish fundamentals in Europe as well as parts of Asia.\nMoving on to the CNS segment outlook on Slide 11. Deere's Construction & Forestry 2023 net sales are now forecasted to be up around 15%. Our net sales guidance for the year considers about 10 points of positive price realization. Operating margin is now expected to be in the range of 18% to 19%.\nNext, we'll shift to our financial services operations on Slide 12. The Worldwide Financial Services net income attributable to Deere & Company in the second quarter was $28 million. The decrease was due to less favorable financing spreads and a higher provision for credit losses partially offset by income earned on a higher average portfolio.\nAdditionally, during the quarter, there was $135 million after-tax correction of the accounting treatment and timing of expense recognition for financing incentives offered to John Deere dealers. The accounting correction is unrelated to the current market conditions or the credit quality of the financial services portfolio, which remains strong.\nFor fiscal year 2023, our outlook is now $630 million, reflecting the less favorable financing spreads, the correction of the accounting treatment for financing incentives, a higher provision for credit losses increased SA&G expenses and lower gains on operating lease dispositions, partially offset by the benefits from a higher average portfolio balance.\nTurning to Slide 13. Credit quality remains well above historical averages with minimal allowances, past dues and write-offs as a percentage of the portfolio. Provisions for credit losses, excluding the portfolio in Russia, is it forecast to be at 17 basis points for fiscal '23 and remains below long-term averages. Meanwhile, write-offs past dues and nonperforming loans all remained stable, reflecting strong credit quality within our portfolio.\nAnd lastly, on Slide 14, we've outlined our guidance for our net income our effective tax rate and operating cash flow. For fiscal year 2023, we are again raising our outlook for net income to be between $9.25 billion and $9.5 billion. Reflecting the strong results for the second quarter, and continued optimism for the remainder of the year. Next, our guidance incorporates an effective tax rate between 23% and 25%.\nLastly, our cash flow from equipment operations is now projected to be in the range of $10 billion to $10.5 billion.\nThat concludes our formal comments. We will now shift to a discussion of a few specific topics relevant to this quarter before we open the line for Q&A.\nLet's start with Deere's performance this quarter, Brent. We saw production in precision ag net revenue up 53% year-over-year, and operating margins expanded 7 points. Small Ligand turf, up 16% on revenue with 6 points of additional operating margin and CNS with 23% top line growth accompanied by 4% operating margin expansion, excluding the nonrecurring items.\nWhat were the primary drivers of the strong quarter?\n\nBrent Norwood\n\nDirector of Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Rachel. I would start by saying the performance came in ahead of our own internal expectations due to 2 primary drivers. From a top line perspective, our factories had their best quarter of execution since the beginning of COVID. Supply chain improvements enabled our factories to hit their line rates and deliver machines at a faster pace. As a result, we were able to pull ahead some of the year's production into the second quarter, which will take some pressure off the back half. So we'd expect revenue to be down sequentially by a bit over 10% in the third quarter. With factories running more smoothly, we experienced fewer production inefficiencies. In fact, the second quarter saw the lowest level of production cost inflation since 1Q 2021. Fewer factory disruptions due to labor and supply chain challenges enabled us to achieve better overhead efficiency and incur lower premium freight costs.\nFurthermore, production costs benefited from better raw material compares relative to last year.\n\nRachel Bach\n\nThat's helpful perspective on the benefits of the improving supply chain in our factories. As we pull production forward, how does that shape the back half of the year? Will the supply chain allow for increased production in the second half?\n\nBrent Norwood\n\nDirector of Investor Relations\n\nSupply chain improvements have enabled our suppliers to deliver towards their volume commitments and improve their on-time deliveries. That said, there are still enough constraints in the supply base that will limit higher levels of production later in the year. Our safety stocks for critical components are still low and our margin of error is relatively thin. Given the existing constraints, we expect to execute to schedule but don't foresee adding a lot more production to the back half of the year.\nFurthermore, we are also laser-focused on managing field inventory as we think about exiting fiscal year 2023. The real benefit of the pull ahead is the return to more seasonal production schedules that are closer to our customers' seasonal use of our products.\n\nRachel Bach\n\nMy next question is for Kanlaya. There are a lot of variables impacting farmer fundamentals this season. Farm net income will be at a second all-time high, albeit down from last year's record. Commodity prices remain volatile, while input prices are coming down. Meanwhile, stocks use remained tight and 2 of the 4 largest export markets for corn remain severely constrained. How are these factors impacting farmers right now?\n\nKanlaya Barr\n\nDirector of Corporate Economics\n\nWell, thanks for the question, Rachel. There are many factors that play here, and there's still a lot of uncertainties, especially as we are in the midst of the growing season. And in the end, it also come down to profitability.\nOn the revenue side, auto commodity prices are volatile grain stocks continue to be tight, bumper crops in Russia, Australia and Brazil are not enough to offset the combined effect of this year's severe losses in Argentina and Ukraine. As some trend yield stock to use will remain below the 10-year average. The USDA forecasts corn and soybean prices to be the third highest in the past decade and read the second highest.\nFurthermore, crop insurance reference price will provide the stint for farmers as well. Now looking on at the cost side, input costs has come down quite a bit. Not all farmers will be able to realize those savings this year, but that could be a tailwind for the next crop. And in the end, we are looking at a lower cost per [indiscernible] this year. Now putting all of this together, we are coming off a really great year last year. Income is going to moderate, but we are still looking at farmers margins that are going to be above the 10-year average.\n\nRachel Bach\n\nAnd how about elevated interest rates globally? How are farmers continuing with this increase in cost over last year?\n\nKanlaya Barr\n\nDirector of Corporate Economics\n\nInterest rate expense is only about 6% to 7% of total ag production expenses, but a little over half of that is tied to mortgages, which are mostly fixed at lower rates. The portion that ties to operating loans that tend to be more variable, it's about 30% and that number is even smaller for roll crop producers. Their interest rate expense is less than 1% of their operating expenses. So this is nothing but the impact of high interest rate is much smaller than the tailwinds from lower input costs and fuel costs.\nWith that said, rising interest rates have also had an impact on real estate while the housing market has been significantly affected by the elevated interest rates, the farmland market has been relatively immune and farmland value continue to hold up through Q2 of this year.\n\nDavid Christopher Gilmore\n\nSenior Vice President of Global Sales & Marketing and Region 3 - John Deere Financial\n\nAnd Rachel, just to add some context from some comments that came from the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City earlier this spring. When you put interest rates in perspective relative to history, roughly $0.12 of every dollar of a Midwest U.S. farm earnings is going to interest costs today versus the long-term average of $0.15.\nAs a result, customers are managing this expense very well. Also, as the Fed reported, the marginal increase in interest costs on operating loans is the financial equivalent of an additional 2.5 bushels of yield for corn. That's why a major component of our smart industrial strategy is focused on helping our customers better manage volatile periods by delivering products and solutions that minimize costs and increase yields. Our goal is to deliver products and solutions that offset and improve the variable cost structure of our farmers.\n\nRachel Bach\n\nThanks, Dave. That really helps paint the picture. Kanlaya, what other tailwinds or headwinds should we think about over the next few years?\n\nKanlaya Barr\n\nDirector of Corporate Economics\n\nWell, that's a great question, Rachel. The volatility and uncertainties will continue to be with us for quite some time. However, we expect a tailwind from growing population and increased income to continue.\nIn addition, biofuels will play an increasingly important part in the sustainability journey by providing a diesel alternative to the Transportation segment. including heavy-duty or off-highway vehicles, long-haul aviation and marine time.\nAnd finally, think about technological improvement in farm equipment, which will continue to drive productivity, reduce cost and provide more economic headroom. So overall, still a large number of positive tailwinds to consider.\n\nJoshua A. Jepsen\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Deere & Company\n\nOne other obvious thing to add here is while we can't control the macro volatility. We can focus proactively on monitoring and staying ahead of shifts and trends to ensure we're helping farmers be more effective and efficient in and out of the field regardless of the end market environment.\n\nRachel Bach\n\nThanks, Josh and Kanya. Let's dig in a little deeper on the global issues you mentioned and focus specifically on the Brazilian market. Dave, Brazil has been one of the strongest markets in the industry over the last 3 years. What's been driving that?\n\nDavid Christopher Gilmore\n\nSenior Vice President of Global Sales & Marketing and Region 3 - John Deere Financial\n\nWell, as you correctly said, Rachel, Brazil certainly has been a great market for us, both in terms of growth and profitability. It's one of the few geographies in the world, adding production area each year. It's also a market that's rapidly adding efficiencies, migrating to higher horsepower and just beginning to adopt precision ag technology, which plays to our strengths. The last few years have seen records both in terms of agricultural yields but also farmer profitability. The combination of record ag production, favorable currency and growing exports has generated excellent profitability for our customers and, in turn, has driven significant demand for our equipment over the last few years.\n\nJoshua A. Jepsen\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Deere & Company\n\nYes, this is Josh. One thing I'd add to Dave's comments. At the onset of our smart industrial strategy, we set a goal to achieve North American like margins or better in Latin America. And so far, we've achieved that, making the region very important to the overall financial profile of the company.\n\nRachel Bach\n\nI guess that leads right into my follow-up question. Dave, how are current market conditions trending? Can you give us an update post the agri show earlier this month?\n\nDavid Christopher Gilmore\n\nSenior Vice President of Global Sales & Marketing and Region 3 - John Deere Financial\n\nAbsolutely, Rachel. I was just down in Brazil for Agri show, which is the largest customer farm show in Latin America. The event produced record attendance and sales, highlighting customer optimism going forward.\nThat said, sales for small ag equipment have been running behind pace this year, leading to increased field inventory. The government-sponsored financing plan typically gets announced at Agri show, but it's been postponed for the time being, which has caused some delay in purchases, especially for small and medium producers who are most reliant on the government-sponsored financing for equipment purchases. Large producers on the other hand, tend to be less reliant on government-sponsored financing, instead utilizing cash, private credit lines or John Deere Financial. The delayed harvest plan has had limited impact for large ag customers. More pressing for large producers right now is exporting the record crop that they grew this year in a timely manner -- given the lack of storage for Brazilian grains. However, demand for large equipment remains stable, though we are monitoring retail activity closely for the back half of the year.\nI would note that we do expect to see higher in-season inventory this year, further reflecting a return to normalcy for the market.\n\nRachel Bach\n\nAppreciate the additional insight into a pivotal market everyone is watching very closely right now. I'd like to transition briefly to John Deere Financial and discuss 2 topics: First, it's been an eventful quarter for many of our nation's regional banks. Josh, can you give us an update on how John Deere Financial is faring in this environment?\n\nJoshua A. Jepsen\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Deere & Company\n\nOf course, Rachel. We're closely monitoring all the challenges in the banking sector as the market is contended with rising rates over the last year. Fortunately, John Deere's financial remains in excellent condition. There's been no change in our ability to fund the portfolio and the credit quality has been outstanding. As we discussed previously, our forecast this year implies past dues, nonperforming loans and write-offs are stable and remain below long-term averages.\nFor our lease portfolio, return rates are near 0 and recovery rates are as strong as they've ever been. Our customers have had 3 very strong years financially, including 2023. So we feel like we are very well positioned here.\n\nRachel Bach\n\nThat's good to hear. And the second question on John your Financial, we saw net income affected by $135 million after-tax correction of accounting treatment. Can you explain what that was related to and what impact that might have, if any, on future profitability?\n\nJoshua A. Jepsen\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Deere & Company\n\nSure thing. It relates to the accounting treatment of dealer loyalty incentive program. Effectively, we've made an accounting correction on the timing of expense recognition moving from when incentives are redeemed to when they're earned, much in line with our methods for our equipment operations incentives. Due to the coincidental timing of broader market concerns, I just want to make it abundantly clear that this is a onetime noncash accounting correction. It is unrelated to the credit quality or performance of GDF portfolio.\n\nRachel Bach\n\nPerfect. Thanks for the clarification, Josh. The next question is related to inventory. The recent AEM data shows a year-over-year increase in large ag inventory for products like combines and 4-wheel drive tractors. Dave, can you explain what's going on with the new field inventory at the moment?\n\nDavid Christopher Gilmore\n\nSenior Vice President of Global Sales & Marketing and Region 3 - John Deere Financial\n\nThe large ag inventory build seen recently is due to the return to normal seasonality in our production schedules. Keep in mind that year-over-year comparisons aren't as relevant because of the challenges we faced in the first half of 2022 from the labor disruption to supply chain obstacles. These challenges caused us to run at low and unhealthy levels during all of 2022, making the year-over-year increase appear somewhat inflated.",
        "content2": "Compared to historic averages, however, we are still well below seasonally adjusted target levels with inventory to sales ratios for 220 plus and 4-wheel drive tractors in the teens as of the end of April. Pre-COVID, both products would have been at least 10 points higher in the second quarter on an inventory-to-sales ratio basis.\nMeanwhile, our combined inventory to sales ratio currently sits at 23% as we were able to pull some of our production ahead into the second quarter. At this time, we expect the second quarter to be the highest production for combines this year. Combined inventory seasonally peaks during the quarter of highest production with historic average IS ratios greater than where we are currently.\nThere are a lot of benefits to returning to normal seasonality and one of which is it contributes to a healthier pace of used trades for our dealers and customers. These were delayed last year due to heavy fourth quarter deliveries.\nLast year, customers were reluctant to allow a dealer to remarket their used trade before the new machine arrived. Being on a more seasonal pace facilitates better used trade planning prior to the harvest season. So we've seen used inventories increase seasonally, keeping up with elevated production of new equipment, which is good for both dealers and customers.\nThe most important takeaway is that by the end of the year, large ag inventory to sales will be lower than both historic and target levels.\n\nRachel Bach\n\nAnd one final question. Brent, how would you characterize the market environment for farm equipment as we progress through the back half of the year and into 2024.\n\nBrent Norwood\n\nDirector of Investor Relations\n\nIt's a great question, Rachel. But first, I think it's best to start with some context on how we got to this point. The current replacement cycle began in 2021 after a 6-year period of historic underinvestment in ag equipment. And since 2021, the entire industry has been severely constrained by labor and the supply base, which kept production volumes relatively modest when compared to prior replacement periods. Inventory for new and used equipment remains below target levels, and the fleet has continued to age out for tractors, even if it's down a bit for combines.\nWhile it's been difficult working through all the challenges in the post-COVID era, these constraints created an unintended benefit of dampening the amplitude of the equipment cycle for the time being.\nTo quantify that, we are producing roughly 20% to 25% less than the average production volumes of prior replacement periods.\nAs we look ahead to the rest of 2023, we see robust demand with our order books providing excellent visibility through the end of the year.\nFurthermore, we expect the ending inventories in 2023 to be below target levels, making for a very good starting position entering 2024.\nWith regards to next year, we'll begin to gain more visibility soon with our early order programs and order books continuing through the summer and fall seasons. As evidence of continued healthy demand levels, we opened Phase 1 of our sprayer early order program in May and are already sold out of our Phase 1 allocation.\nFurthermore, our sprayer early order program included pricing in line with historic averages, pointing to a reversion to normalcy for the industry.\nOverall, the environment continues to be healthy and supportive of a business cycle with a dampened amplitude.\n\nRachel Bach\n\nThanks for the commentary on Insight Brent. And before we open the line for other questions, Josh, any final thoughts?\n\nJoshua A. Jepsen\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Deere & Company\n\nSure. We've had a very strong first half of 2023. This is a testament to the extraordinary efforts of the entire John Deere team. Everyone from our employees, to dealers and suppliers have remained committed to providing customers with the best experience possible.\nAs we move into the second half of the year, we're encouraged by strong visibility through the remainder of the year.\nAdditionally, while we're seeing improvement in the supply chain, which is helping us to deliver product and solutions for our customers, the situation remains fragile.\nOverall, fleet dynamics such as inventory and fleet age and on balance positive fundamentals, put us in a good position to continue to deliver customer value in 2023 and beyond.\nAlthough it's too early to have a firm view on '24, the fundamentals give us confidence as we move into our early order program selling season.\nImportantly, we will continue to invest for the long term to unlock value for customers. And as we do this, we remain dedicated to drive further structural profitability for Deere as evidenced across all our segments the last couple of years. This will include new ways to add value and create more resilient, sustainable businesses for our customers and Deere.\n\nRachel Bach\n\nThanks, Josh. Now let's open the line for questions from our investors. Brent?"

Additional information concerning these measures, including reconciliations to compare GAAP measures is included in the release and posted on our website at johndeere.com/earnings under Quarterly Earnings and Events. I will now turn the call over to Rachel Bach.\n\nRachel Bach\n\nThanks, Brent, and good morning. John Deere completed the first quarter with solid execution. Financial results for the quarter included 20% margin for the equipment operations. While still far from normal levels, fewer supply chain disruptions enabled our factories to operate at high levels of production. Strong ag fundamentals remain, our order [book is] still in allocation are full well into the fourth quarter and, in some cases, full through the balance of the year. Likewise, the construction and forestry division continues to benefit from healthy demand with order books fall into the fourth quarter and orders still on an allocation basis.\nSlide 3 shows the results for the first quarter. Net sales and revenues were up 30% to $12.652 billion, while net sales for the equipment operations were up 34% to $11.402 billion. Net income attributable to Deere & Company was $1.959 billion or $6.55 per diluted share. Taking a closer look at the individual segments, beginning with the production and precision ag business on Slide 4. Net sales of $5.198 billion were up 55% compared to the first quarter last year and up versus our own forecast, primarily due to higher shipment volumes and price realization. Price was positive by about 22 points. We expect price realization to be the highest early in the fiscal year, due in part the model year '21 machines produced and shipped in the first quarter of 2022, effectively including 2 model years when compared to the first quarter of '23. Currency translation was negative by roughly 1 point. Operating profit, $1.208 billion, resulting in a 23.2% operating margin for the segment compared to an 8.8% margin for the same period last year.\nThe year-over-year increase was primarily due to favorable price realization and improved shipment volume and mix. These were partially offset by higher production costs and increased R&D and SA&G. Prior year results were negatively impacted by lower production from the delayed ratification of our labor agreement as well as by the contract ratification bonus.\nMoving to small ag and turf on Slide 5. Net sales were up 14%, totaling $3.001 billion in the first quarter as a result of price realization and higher shipment volumes, partially offset by negative effects of currency translation.\nPrice realization was positive by just over 11 points, while currency translation was negative by nearly 4 points. Operating profit was up year-over-year at $447 million, resulting in a 14.9% operating margin. The increased profit was primarily due to price realization and higher shipment volume, partially offset by higher production costs, R&D and SA&G.\nSlide 6 shows our industry outlook for the ag and turf markets globally. We expect industry sales of large ag equipment in U.S. and Canada to be up approximately 5% to 10%, reflecting another year of durable demand. The dynamics of strong ag fundamentals, advanced fleet age and low field inventory all remain.\nWe expect demand to exceed the industry's ability to produce for yet another year. For small ag and turf, we estimate industry sales in the U.S. and Canada to be down around 5%. Within the segment, order books for products linked to ag production systems remain resilient, while demand for consumer-oriented products such as compact tractors under 40-horsepower has softened considerably since last year. Moving on to Europe. The industry is forecast to be flat to up 5%. Fundamentals continue to be solid, so moderating from recent highs and net foreign cash income remains healthy. In South America, we expect industry sales of tractors and combines to be flat to up 5% following a very strong year in fiscal year '22. Farmer profitability remains high as our customers benefit from robust commodity prices, record production at variable currency environment.\nAnd while the backdrop in a large ag is favorable, demand for low horsepower softened a bit over the first quarter. Industry sales in Asia are forecasted to be down moderately. Now our segment forecasts, beginning on Slide 7. For production and precision ag, net sales are forecast to be up around 20% for the full year. Forecast assumes about 14 points of positive price realization for the full year and minimal currency impact. As noted earlier, we expect to achieve higher price realization in the first half of the year and then see it moderate a bit in the latter half. The segment's operating margin is now between 23.5% and 24.5%.\nSlide 8 shows our forecast for the amall ag and turf segment. We expect net sales to be flat to up 5%. This guidance includes 8 points of positive price realization and less than 0.5 point of currency headwind. The segment's operating margin is projected between 14.5% and 15.5%.\nChanging to construction and forestry on Slide 9. Net sales for the quarter were $3.203 billion, up 26%, primarily due to higher shipment volumes and price realization. Results were better than our own forecast for the quarter. Price realization was positive by over 13 points, while currency translation was negative by about 3 points. Operating profit of $625 million was higher year-over-year, resulting in a 19.5% operating margin due to price realization and higher shipment volumes, partially offset by higher production costs.\nC&F had several miscellaneous items that were positive to the first quarter results. The impact of these positive items was approximately 1.5 points of margin, and we do not expect them to repeat. Prior year results include the impact of the lower production in the first quarter due to the delayed ratification of our labor agreement as well as the contract ratification bonus.\nLet's turn to our 2023 construction and forestry industry outlook on Slide 10. Industry sales of earthmoving and compact construction equipment in North America are both projected to be flat to up 5%. End markets for earthmoving and compact equipment is expected to remain strong. While housing has softened. Infrastructure, the oil and gas sector and robust CapEx programs from the independent rental companies have continued to support demand. Retail sales have remained robust and dealer inventory is well below historic levels.\nGlobal road building markets are forecast to be flat. North America remains the strongest market, compensating for softness in Europe as well as in parts of Asia. In forestry, we estimate the industry will be flat as softening in the U.S. and Canada is offset with strength in Europe. Moving to the C&F segment outlook on Slide 11. Deere's construction and forestry 2023 net sales are forecast to be up between 10% and 15%.\nOur net sales guidance for the year considers around 9 points of positive price realization. Operating margin is expected to be in the range of 17% to 18%. Shifting to our financial services operations on Slide 12. Worldwide financial services net income attributable to Deere & Company in the first quarter was $185 million. The decrease in net income was mainly due to less favorable financing spreads.\nFor fiscal year 2023, our outlook is now $820 million as the less favorable financing spreads, higher SA&G expenses, and lower gains on operating lease dispositions are expected to more than offset the benefits from a higher average portfolio (inaudible). The less favorable financing spreads in both the first quarter results and outlook are a function of the velocity of interest rate increases and the lag and price changes.\nCredit quality remains favorable with very low write-offs as a percentage of the portfolio. Slide 13 outlines our guidance for net income, our effective tax rate and operating cash flow. For fiscal '23, we are raising our outlook for net income to be between $8.75 billion and $9.25 billion, reflecting the strong results of the first quarter and continued optimism for the remainder of the year. Next, our guidance incorporates an effective tax rate between 23% and 25%. Lastly, cash flow from the equipment operations is now projected to be in the range of $9.25 billion to $9.75 billion.\nThat concludes our formal comments. Now I'd like to spend some time going deeper on a few things specific to this quarter. Let's start with farmer fundamentals. The USDA recently updated its farm income forecast. U.S. net cash farm income is forecast to be down in 2023 compared to 2022, but still well above long-term averages and at levels supportive of continued replacement demand. Importantly, crop cash receipts are predicted to be down only 3% and remain at very healthy levels for row crop producers. And while expenses are expected to be up, some key inputs like fertilizers have moderated since peaking in 2022. All in, the 2023 income forecasts are solid and will continue to support equipment demand. This may be specific to the U.S., but the message is similar across our various global markets, right, Brent?\n\nBrent Norwood\n\nDirector of IR, Deere & Company\n\nThat's right. And I would add that global stocks to use remain very tight, keeping grain prices elevated, even if they are down a bit from the highs of last summer. So the story here is one of slightly lower net income, but still quite profitable, which is true in most ag markets globally. As noted earlier, profitability in Europe remains solid. While grain prices have come off peak levels, input costs have also declined, keeping margin at supportive levels there. The relative profitability varies a bit by region with Central Europe, faring a bit better than Western Europe, but overall, still solid across the region. And in Brazil, higher production and favorable FX has kept profitability solid, making the region one of the strongest from a fundamentals perspective. The political transition and rising interest rate environment could result in some softening for smaller ag equipment, but large ag equipment demand is holding steady.\n\nJoshua A. Jepsen\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Deere & Company\n\nThis is Josh. One thing I'd like to add here is that when we meet with dealers, we hear a consistent message from them, too. They're positive on the outlook and customer demand. We even get feedback, they could quote more customers if they weren't on allocation. So we feel good that the demand is out there. Our dealers are also optimistic about the level of tech adoption and demand for precision ag solutions as customers look to reduce expensive inputs, which improve profitability and sustainability. And this is not just a North American theme, but across the globe. I was with our dealers from Latin America earlier in the quarter, and the appetite for increased technology from our customers is very strong, and our dealers are investing heavily to deliver on the value proposition.\n\nRachel Bach\n\nThat's a good perspective on the industry outlook and the dealer feedback. With that in mind, our order books were generally fall into the fourth quarter as we look across the global large ag business. Most orders are retail, so they have a specific customer name associated with them, and we anticipate it will be yet another year where large ag equipment demand outstrip supply. But if we look more closely at our small ag and turf division, the story is more (inaudible) . Can you step through that, Brent?\n\nBrent Norwood\n\nDirector of IR, Deere & Company\n\nSure. if we dissect the segment, around 2/3 of our sales are linked to products tied to ag production systems like dairy and livestock, hay and forage and high-value crops. The remainder is tied more to consumer-oriented products. So hay and forage and lifestyle margins remain above recent historical averages. Additionally, dealer inventory to sales ratio for midsized tractors are below normal levels. So this part of small ag and turf has remained steady. A good proof point here is that the order book for our midsized tractors built in Monheim, Germany is filled well into the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023.\nOn the other hand, turf and utility equipment is more closely correlated with the general economy, specifically housing. So we've seen softening there, particularly in compact utility tractors. This is more in place where we've seen industry inventories build. And to round out the conversation on order books. Construction and forestry is also full into the fourth quarter. Given levels of demand, we do not anticipate any rebuilding -- any rebuilding of channel inventory in fiscal year 2023.\n\nRachel Bach\n\nLet's stay on that topic of inventory building. And going back to your comment, Brent, on turf and utility equipment industry and inventories. Is that increase in channel inventory purely related to the softening in demand or any of that seasonal for turf and utility equipment?\n\nBrent Norwood\n\nDirector of IR, Deere & Company\n\nA mix of both. We are heading into the prime spring selling season for turf and utility equipment. So we normally have some inventory build at this time of the year that will sell off as we go through the spring. But we're monitoring channel inventory closely, so we can react quickly if there is further softening in demand.\n\nRachel Bach\n\nWhat about channel inventory for our other segments?\n\nBrent Norwood\n\nDirector of IR, Deere & Company\n\nYes. For large ag, our dealers remain on allocation as we've mentioned. The vast majority of orders are marked for retail and have a customer name associated with them. So we don't expect to see a restocking of dealer inventory this year. You'll see some channel inventory build seasonally a bit as we ramp up production ahead of the use season, but we don't predict much change in dealer inventory year-over-year by our fiscal year-end. We expect any restocking to be more of a 2024 story. And as I noted, it's the same for our North America construction and forestry business. Dealer inventory is at historic [lows]. Based on retail demand and our production levels, we don't anticipate much increase in dealer inventory. Again, we would expect any build there to occur in 2024.\n\nJoshua A. Jepsen\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Deere & Company\n\nMaybe a couple of things to add here. As mentioned, our dealer inventories remain below historic levels as demand outpaces supply. We've noted a few times that our order books are still on allocation basis. And this continues because while supply challenges have eased, the supply chain is still fragile. It's getting better, but we continue to experience higher-than-normal supply disruptions. We're working with our supply chain and doing our best to try to ensure delivery to our customers. Second, since new equipment inventories remain tight, our dealers are seeing the benefit in used equipment. Deals are turning their used equipment very quickly at a historically fast pace, demonstrating resilient demand for used. As a result, used equipment inventories are at low levels and used equipment prices continue to be strong. This is a positive for customers as it reduces their trade differentials. This is especially true for both large ag and construction and forestry.\n\nRachel Bach\n\nThanks, Josh. Let's shift to pricing. Production and precision ag in particular, benefited some high price realization here in the first quarter. This isn't a normal comparison though, Josh, can you break that down for us?\n\nJoshua A. Jepsen\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Deere & Company\n\nYou're right. It's not a normal year-over-year compare. It's really comparing 2 years' worth of price increases. Last year, during the first quarter, we were still shipping a fair number of model year '21 machine. We were behind on deliveries due to the work stoppage at some of our largest U.S. factories. So for example, a lot of tractors we shipped during the first quarter of 2022 were actually model year '21 machines and model year pricing.\nDuring the remainder of fiscal '22, we experienced significant material inflation, but we also successfully increased line rates to catch up on shipments. So we shipped most of the model year '22 tractors during fiscal '22. So now here in the first quarter of '23, nearly all of the tractor shipments were model year '23. So when one looks at the first quarter year-over-year price comparison is a really model year '23 versus model year '21 or 2 years for the of price.\nWe do believe the price comparisons will moderate in the back half of the year. Our full year forecast contemplates production costs increasing year-over-year due to the impact of labor, energy prices and purchase components. Though we do expect the increases to be at a much lesser extent than we experienced in '22. We expect to benefit from improvements in commodity prices, decreased use of premium freight and increased productivity as our operations run more smoothly. Looking forward though, as inflationary pressures subside, we expect a reversion to our historical averages for price increases.\n\nRachel Bach\n\nThat's helpful. Thanks, Josh. And also a good segue to talk about the rest of the year compared to the first quarter. It was a strong first quarter. However, in the first quarter, we had fewer production days with the holidays and some plant maintenance, model year switch overs and so on. So as we look to the second quarter, we'll have more production days. C&F, as I mentioned earlier, had some miscellaneous positive items in the first quarter that won't repeat as we progress through the year.\nBrent, can you talk through how people should be thinking about our rest of the year forecast?\n\nBrent Norwood\n\nDirector of IR, Deere & Company\n\nAbsolutely. For PPA and C&F, we're confident in the rest of the year demand. And it's likely that our seasonality for the remainder of the year will look more like our historical cadence with the second and third quarters expected to be the highest in revenue for PPA, for example. The supply chain needs to continue to improve, enabling higher production rates. Part delinquencies and delays have abated, but have not returned to pre-pandemic levels or anything we had consider indicative of a healthy supply chain. Our guidance contemplates that we can procure the material we need to continue production at current daily rates.\nSo with respect to top line guidance, we do not see significant demand risk for the rest of the year, but we do need the supply base to continue to execute. When it comes to production costs, there are a few variables to consider. As Josh mentioned, while raw material prices and the need for premium freight have eased, we continue to see inflation on purchase components, labor and energy. So some puts and takes there. If the supply chain continues to improve, we could see some additional productivity gains in our operations.\n\nJoshua A. Jepsen\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Deere & Company\n\nThis is Josh. One, I want to point out that when it comes to costs, we're not just waiting for things to get better. We're working with our suppliers to improve on-time deliveries and manage through inflationary pressures. We continue to look for opportunities to source differently when it makes sense, and we're looking at our own processes as well to continue to improve efficiency and cost we can control. So cost is top of mind and a key focus area.\n\nRachel Bach\n\nOne last special topic. We recently published our 2022 sustainability report. It can be found on deere.com/sustainability, and I would encourage people to take a look at it.\nJosh, any highlights you'd like to point out?\n\nJoshua A. Jepsen\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Deere & Company\n\nYes. A few things here to highlight. We made progress on our Leap Ambitions, including engaged, highly engaged, sustainably engaged acres. Engaged acres give us a foundational understanding of customer utilization of Deere technology, and we continue to enable our customers to use data to do more with less Unlocking economic value, while also improving environmental outcomes. We formed partnerships to accelerate this value unlock for customers.\nOne example is a demonstration farm with Iowa State University, where over several years, we'll be able to test various sustainable farm management strategies and farming practices. We'll be able to collect data that mirrors our customers' applications and decision-making to deliver better solutions. We introduced the ExactShot feature on planters at CES 2023. This is a great example of a solution that enables our customers to do more with less and leverages our tech stack, pulling nozzle technology from sprayers onto ExactEmerge planter to deliver starter fertilizer on the seed and only on the seed when planting.\nWe also introduced prototype of our first fully electric excavator at CES. It's a Deere designed excavator with a Kreisel battery. It shows our focus on electrification in response to customer pull for quieter and safer solutions, while executing jobs in a lower emission manner. It's an example of the team making progress on reducing Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions for which we have validated science-based targets.\nWith our focus on creating value for customers and being organized around their production systems, the solutions shown at CES underpinned the message of real purpose real technology with a real impact in all we do. I also want to highlight the significant progress we made in terms of our operational sustainability goals. For example, Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions, we had a goal of 15% reduction between 2017 and 2022. As we close out 2023, we almost doubled that achieving a reduction of nearly 29% during that time frame. So it's not just our products, but our operations having a positive impact, too.\n\nRachel Bach\n\nThat's good stuff. And before we open the line for other questions, Josh, any final comments?\n\nJoshua A. Jepsen\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Deere & Company\n\nSure. It was a good first quarter. Strong results in start of the year. Fundamentals in demand across -- are solid across most parts of our business. The supply chain is showing early signs of improvement, but remains fragile, so the teams are managing through it. We're proud of the team, of employees, suppliers and dealers as we continue to work together to deliver our products and solutions to our customers. It was also very exciting at CES to reveal new solutions that will unlock value for our customers, not just economic value, but sustainable as well. You can read about it and the progress in the 2022 sustainability report, but to see it at CES and our strategy in action reinforces our belief that we have tremendous purpose and the ability to deliver real value for all those associated with Deere.\n\nRachel Bach\n\nThank you. Now let's open the line for questions from our investors.\n\nBrent Norwood\n\nDirector of IR, Deere & Company\n\nNow we are ready to begin the Q&A portion of the call.

(Operator Instructions)\nI would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Brent Norwood, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.\n\nBrent Norwood\n\nDirector of IR, Deere & Company\n\nHello. Also on the call today are John May, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Josh Jepsen, Chief Financial Officer; and Rachel Bach, Manager of Investor Communications.\nToday, we'll take a closer look at Deere's fourth quarter earnings. Then spend some time talking about our markets and our current outlook for fiscal year 2023. After that, we'll respond to your questions. Please note that slides are available to complement the call this morning. They can be accessed on our website at johndeere.com/earnings.\nFirst, a reminder.

Additional information concerning these measures, including reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures, is included in the release and posted on our website at johndeere.com/earnings under Quarterly Earnings and Events.\nI will now turn the call over to Rachel Bach.\n\nRachel Bach\n\nGood morning. John Deere finished the year with strong fourth quarter, thanks to a 40% increase in net sales. Financial results for the quarter included an 18.5% margin for the equipment operations.\nAcross our businesses, performance was driven by continued strong demand, higher production rates and progress on reducing our inventory of partially completed machines. Looking ahead, ag fundamentals remain positive, continuing to drive healthy demand as evidenced by our order books full into the third quarter of fiscal year 2023.\nThe construction and forestry markets also continued to benefit from solid demand contributing to the division's notable performance in the quarter. Similarly, order books are extended into the second half of '23, providing visibility and confidence in the new fiscal year.\nSlide 3 shows the results for fiscal year 2022. Net sales and revenues were up 19% to $52.6 billion, while net sales for the equipment operations were up 21% to $47.9 billion. Net income attributable to Deere & Company was $7.1 billion or $23.28 per diluted share.\nNext, fourth quarter results are on Slide 4. Net sales and revenues were up 37% to $15.5 billion, while net sales for the equipment operations were up 40% to $14.4 billion. Net income attributable to Deere & Company was $2.2 billion or $7.44 per diluted share.\nLet's take a closer look at fourth quarter results by segment, beginning with our production and precision ag business on Slide 5. Net sales of $7.434 billion, were up markedly at 59% compared to the fourth quarter last year. This was primarily due to higher production rates both year-over-year and sequentially.\nAdditionally, we made progress on clearing partially completed machines from inventory. Both contributed to higher shipment volumes for the quarter. Price realization in the quarter was positive by about 19 points, whereas currency translation was negative by about 3 points. Operating profit was $1.74 billion, resulting in a 23.4% operating margin for the segment. The year-over-year increase in operating profit was primarily due to higher shipment volumes and price realization, partially offset by higher production costs and higher SA&G and R&D spend.\nOperating profit for the quarter was negatively impacted by higher reserves on the remaining assets in Russia, affecting the quarter's margin by about 1 point. The production costs were mostly elevated material and freight. Overhead spend was also higher for the period as factories continue to experience some production inefficiencies due to supply challenges and clearing of partially completed machines in inventory.\nDespite these headwinds, our factories were able to maintain higher rates of production and reduce the number of partially completed machines in inventory, allowing us to deliver more equipment to our dealers and customers.\nMoving to Small Ag & Turf on Slide 6. Net sales were up 26%, totaling $3.544 billion in the fourth quarter due to higher shipment volumes and price realization, which more than offset negative currency translation.\nPrice realization in the quarter was positive by nearly 13 points, while currency translation was negative by over 6 points. For the quarter, operating profit was higher year-over-year at $506 million, resulting in a 14.3% operating margin. The increased profit was primarily due to price realization and improved shipment volumes and mix. These were partially offset by higher production costs, higher R&D and SA&G expenses and unfavorable currency impacts.\nPlease turn to Slide 7 for the fiscal year 2023 ag and turf industry outlook. We expect large ag equipment industry sales in U.S. and Canada to be up 5% to 10%, reflecting resilient demand that continues to be higher than the industry's ability to supply, bolstered by the need to replace aging fleets. Our order books now extend into the third quarter and the dealers remain on allocation for '23. For small ag and turf, industry demand is estimated to be flat to down 5%.\nThe Dairy and Livestock segment remained steady. However, demand for products more correlated to the general economy, such as compact utility tractors and turf equipment is softening.\nShifting to Europe. The industry is forecast to be flat to up 5%. Farm fundamentals in the region are generally stable since small grain prices continue to outpace input inflation. Meanwhile, supply constraints in 2022 are extending the equipment replacement into 2023.\nIn South America, we expect industry sales of tractors and combines to be flat to up 5%, moderated by supply chain constraints. The region remains one of the stronger end markets, especially in Brazil, where they are forecasting record production and strong profitability for the year. Industry sales in Asia are projected to be down moderately as India, the world's largest tractor market by unit stabilizes after record highs in 2021.\nTurning now to our segment forecast on Slide 8. We anticipate production and precision ag net sales to be up between 15% and 20% in fiscal year '23. The forecast assumes approximately 11 points of positive price realization and 1 point of negative currency translation. For the segment's operating margin, our full year forecast is between 22% and 23%.\nSlide 9 shows our forecast for the Small Ag & Turf segment. We expect fiscal year '23 net sales to be flat to up 5%. This guidance includes about 7 points of positive price realization, partially offset by 2 points of unfavorable currency impact. After accounting for the effects of price and FX, the guide implies a slight volume decrease due to softening in certain product segments. The segment's operating margin is projected to be between 14.5% and 15.5%.\nChanging to Construction & Forestry on Slide 10, price realization and higher shipment volumes both contributed to a 20% increase in net sales for the quarter to $3.373 billion. Price realization in the quarter was positive by nearly 13 points. This was partially offset by almost 5 points of negative currency translation.\nOperating profit increased to $414 million, resulting in a 12% operating margin. Favorable price realization and higher shipment volumes more than offset higher production costs during the quarter. Segment quarterly results were also negatively impacted by 1.5 points of margin due to higher reserves on the remaining assets in Russia.\nNow I'll cover our 2023 Construction & Forestry industry outlook on Slide 11. Industry sales of both earthmoving and compact construction equipment in North America are expected to be flat to up 5%. End markets overall are expected to remain steady as oil and gas, U.S. infrastructure spend and CapEx programs from the independent rental companies offset moderation in the residential sector.\nGlobal forestry markets are expected to be flat as stronger European demand continues to be limited by the industry's ability to produce and demand in North America begins to subdue. Global roadbuilding building markets are also expected to be flat. Demand remains strongest in the Americas, while Europe is softening and Asia remains sluggish.\nOur C&F segment outlook is on Slide 12. 2023 net sales are forecasted to be up around 10%. Our net sales guidance for the year includes about 8 points of positive price realization and just over 1 point of negative currency translation. The segment's operating margin is projected to be 15.5% to 16.5%. Note, fiscal year '22 operating margin would have been 14.5%, excluding special items, such as the onetime gain from the remeasurement of the Deere-Hitachi assets.\nLet's transition to our financial services operations on Slide 13. Worldwide financial services net income attributable to Deere & Company was slightly higher in the fourth quarter year-over-year, mainly due to income earned on a higher average portfolio, partially offset by less favorable financing spreads. The provision for credit loss increased, reflecting economic uncertainty in Russia.\nFinancial Services received at intercompany benefits from the equipment operations, which guarantees investments in certain international markets, including Russia.\nFor fiscal year 2023, the net income forecast is $900 million. Results are expected to be slightly higher year-over-year primarily due to income earned on a higher average portfolio. The portfolio has continued to grow in line with growth in the equipment operations. Overall, Financial Services is expected to continue to deliver steady results. Credit loss provisions, lease return rates and past dues all remain in good shape, reflecting sound balance sheets for our customers.\nSlide 14 outlines our guidance for net income, our effective tax rate and operating cash flow. For fiscal year '23, our full year net income forecast is a range of $8 billion to $8.5 billion. We expect favorable price realization and higher volumes to more than offset increased spend. Next, our guidance incorporates an effective tax rate between 23% and 25%. And lastly, cash flow from equipment operations is projected to be between $9 billion and $9.5 billion.\nBefore we transition to Q&A, John, I'd like to thank you for joining us today. Do you have anything you'd like to add?\n\nJohn C. May\n\nChairman & CEO, Deere & Company\n\nYes. Thanks, Rachel. First, I want to recognize all of our dedicated employees, dealers and suppliers. Fiscal year 2022 was another unprecedented year in several ways. We started the year in a work stoppage at some of our largest U.S. factories, but we resolved that with a groundbreaking industry-leading new contract, then supply and logistics hurdles created disruption and constrained our production worldwide. At times, deliveries were delayed as demand simply outstripped what the industry could supply.\nOur operations folks worked tirelessly to get equipment shipped to our dealers and customers. The team overcame disruptions from part shortages and delays to the clearing of partially completed machines to meet our customers' needs.\nIn the last half of the year, and particularly here in the fourth quarter, we executed to our plans, saw a substantial lift in production and outpaced the industry production and retail sales. This resulted in our highest revenue and margin quarter for the year. It proves what we've known all along, that we've got the best factory teams in the industry, and I'm extremely proud of their efforts and resilience.\nAs I look ahead to fiscal year 2023 and beyond, I truly believe our best years are still ahead of us. In the near term, order books across our businesses are full into the third quarter. And it's important to note that not only do the order books continue to fill when we open them, but the velocity of orders has remained strong. We opened North American combine EOP back in August.\nLike our crop care EOP, it was on an allocations, but it filled in 2 months. That's noteworthy because we normally have the EOP open for 5 to 6 months. And since our order books are still on allocation for retail sales, we have yet to begin replenishing dealer inventory. And as we continue to make progress on our smart industrial strategy and Leap Ambitions, I'm even more confident in our ability to unlock immense value for our customers.\nWhen you integrate the industry's best equipment with cutting-edge technology and a world-class dealer channel, it's powerful and it's exciting. We already have solutions in fields and on work sites, and we are bringing more solutions to the market that will make our customers a lot more productive, a lot more profitable and help them do the jobs they do in a much more environmentally sustainable way.\n\nRachel Bach\n\nGreat. Thanks, John. Now we know there are some -- likely some common topics of interest, so let's dig into those before opening the line for Q&A. First, I'd like to take some time to look more closely at the macro environment and some of the fundamentals for each of our segments.\nLet's start with production in precision ag. We're forecasting the industry to be up 5% to 10%. Brent, there's a lot going on there in terms of what is driving that growth. Can you unpack a little for us?\n\nBrent Norwood\n\nDirector of IR, Deere & Company\n\nSure. There's a few things going on, I'd like to point out, Rachel. Stocks-to-use ratios for key grains still remain very, very low, while exports from the Black Sea region are expected to be down about 40%. So it's going to take a couple of growing seasons to ease the tight supply and this should help support commodity prices in the interim. While crop prices may have come down a little bit since the summer, they remain at levels where our customers still have healthy profits despite some of the higher input costs they're facing.\nFinally, the industry has not been able to meet demand due to supply chain constraints and demand continues to outpace supply. And we see that in how quickly our order books fill up and historically low dealer inventory of both new and used equipment. It's also evident in the fleet age, which is well above average.\n\nRachel Bach\n\nAll right. So fundamentals remain solid, but weather, geopolitical tensions and broader economic conditions may be weighing on our customers' minds.\n\nBrent Norwood\n\nDirector of IR, Deere & Company\n\nYes, that's absolutely true, Rachel, and we recognize that. But our order books really serve as the best indicator though. Not only are they extending into the third quarter of 2023, but the velocity in which they feel remains really encouraging for us.\nRecall that our order books are still on an allocation basis. So when those orders ship, they generally retail right away and almost all of those machines have a customer's name on them when they go down the production line.\nRemember that our dealer inventories still need to be replenished. Four-wheel drive inventory to sales ratios are at 10%, while 220-plus horsepower tractors are at 12%. And those numbers might even be a little bit overstated because our dealers are working through all of those fourth quarter shipments right now, and they're still delivering them to customers. Also of note, our guidance does assume that we build to retail demand. So any dealer inventory replenishment will likely be pushed to 2024.\nAdditionally, I would like to point out that the 2023 North America large ag volumes will be 20% to 25% lower than the 5-year average volume from the 2010 to 2014 replacement cycle. This is clear if you look at the AEM data. Our revenues are higher because we've increased our value per machine for our customers through precision ag solutions. But volumes are still rather modest when compared to the entire replacement period of that 5 years of 2010 to 2014.\n\nJohn C. May\n\nChairman & CEO, Deere & Company\n\nYes, Brent, I have a few things to add here. This last year, I've been out meeting with dealers on a regular basis. And I often hear them telling me that they're not able to quote every customer who wants to place an order because we're still constrained by the supply base and on an allocation basis. So clearly, more demand -- there's more demand for our equipment. And this replacement cycle will have an extended duration. I am confident we will produce more large ag equipment in 2023 than we did in 2022. And not just more equipment, but more value per machine. Our production system approach has us laser-focused on the customer and unlocking more value for them. This will increase the value per machine even more.\n\nRachel Bach\n\nAll right. Let's move on now to small ag and turf. This division has the most diverse end markets of any of our segments. Josh, can you elaborate more on how we're viewing those different markets?\n\nJoshua A. Jepsen\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Deere & Company\n\nSure. There are definitely different macro drivers when you break down the segment a bit further. If we begin with small ag, supply of meat and dairy products has remained tight, which has helped prices remain elevated. And as a result, livestock and dairy margins remain above historical averages. Additionally, dealer inventory to sales ratios for midsized tractors are below levels -- below normal levels as demand has continued to outstrip supply. So this part of SAT has remained stable and resilient. A good proof point here is that the order book for our midsized tractors built in Monheim, Germany is about 70% full, taking us well into the third quarter of fiscal '23.\nOn the other hand, turf and utility equipment as well as compact utility tractors are more closely correlated to the general economy and somewhat specifically to housing. So we've seen some softening there. Channel inventory remains low, especially for turf, buffering our shipments to some extent. But we're monitoring inventory closely so that we can react if demand pulls back more. We don't intend to let inventory climb to prepandemic levels here.\n\nRachel Bach\n\nAll right. That's helpful. Thanks, Josh. Let's shift now to C&F. The last few years of demand were largely driven by housing. So how is that segment responding to higher interest rates and lower housing starts. Brent, can you talk through that?\n\nBrent Norwood\n\nDirector of IR, Deere & Company\n\nYou bet, Rachel. So on one hand, we have seen some softening in housing while nonres building projects have continued to decline a little bit. On the other hand, oil and gas CapEx has been very steady with rig counts projected to be up next year. And U.S. infrastructure is beginning to show some promise going into 2023, which is especially important for (inaudible). In addition to that, both dealer-owned rental channel and the independent players have significant refleeting programs going into 2023. So all in all, we're seeing a shift in the composition of demand drivers for that business, less housing, but more than offset by rental infrastructure and oil and gas.\n\nJohn C. May\n\nChairman & CEO, Deere & Company\n\nBrent, I'd like to add that C&F dealer inventory, as with other parts of our business is historically low and needs to be replenished but we're currently focusing on retail demand and our order books are close to 70% full.\n\nRachel Bach\n\nAll good insight into the various industries and market dynamics, and it's all factored into our net sales guidance for the full year. To recap, common themes across our businesses, our order books are strong, but still on allocation. We're focused on meeting pent-up retail demand, and we still need to replenish channel inventory possibly late 2023, but more likely into 2024. Brent, can you talk about what all this means for our '23 production schedule?\n\nBrent Norwood\n\nDirector of IR, Deere & Company\n\nSure. So this past year, we did not have our normal seasonality. And we had the work stoppage at the beginning of the first quarter, and we had experienced the worst of the supply chain issues as we tried to ramp up more during the second quarter. So we played catch up later in the year, resulting in a significantly more back half-weighted 2022.\nIn fact, we ended up producing more in each successive quarter throughout the year with the fourth quarter being the high point. We achieved our highest daily production rates in the fourth quarter, and we plan to keep those higher daily rates going into the first quarter of 2023.\nNow while line rates remain at those higher levels, there will be some key differences in sequential revenue though. First, there are about 15% less production days in the first quarter due to the holiday season. So expect revenue for small ag and turf and C&F to drop by about 15% sequentially in the first quarter of 2023 when compared to the fourth quarter of 2022.\nOur PPA factories will have another 5% to 10% fewer production days due to some model year changeovers, maintenance, training and supplier recovery. So in total, production and precision ag production time will decrease by 20% to 25% in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter of 2022.\nNow also keep in mind that PPA benefited from clearing about $400 million of partially completed machines from inventory in the fourth quarter. So that benefit won't repeat in the first quarter. So we likely won't get back to a similar level of 4Q revenue until the second quarter of 2023.\n\nJohn C. May\n\nChairman & CEO, Deere & Company\n\nYes. This is John. Brent, I want to reiterate something you said. While sequentially, the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter will be lower. However, year-over-year production will be higher in the first quarter. We aren't starting the year out behind, so we'll have more production in the first half of 2023 than we did in the first half of 2022.\n\nRachel Bach\n\nThat's helpful. Let's switch gears now to the supply chain. We've taken steps to try to mitigate risk, but the supply base remains fragile. We do see pockets improving, but at a slow pace and certainly not to prepandemic levels that we would consider to be a healthier supply chain. So our guide does not assume significant improvement or deterioration in 2023. Josh, can you elaborate on our production costs included in the forecast?\n\nJoshua A. Jepsen\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Deere & Company\n\nAs it relates to production costs in '23, there are a few puts and takes. Certain raw materials like hot-rolled coil steel are easing, as you can see in some of the different indices. Also, we expect the need for premium freight to subside next year.\nOn the other hand, labor and energy costs will increase. That's not only impacting us directly but also our suppliers, so we continue to see increased cost for purchase components as well.\nAdditionally, as you mentioned, we're seeing pockets of improvement in the supply chain, but it remains fragile. So we're not assuming that our operations return to normal levels of productivity and efficiency in our forecast. With the different ups and downs, our guide assumes a net increase in production costs in 2023, but we fully expect this to be offset by price realization and anticipate the full year being price production cost positive.\n\nRachel Bach\n\nThank you for that. And before we open the line for other questions, Josh, can you talk briefly about the use of cash priorities and capital allocation in 2023?\n\nJoshua A. Jepsen\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Deere & Company\n\nSure. Simply put, they remain unchanged. We're happy with our liquidity position to maintain our single A credit rating and fund our business. Our guide considers an increase in R&D and CapEx as we continue to progress on strategic projects building upon the tech stack and unlocking more value for our customers.",
        "content2": "Next, the dividend. We increased it 8% in fiscal year '22. And it's worth noting that over the last 2 years, we've increased it nearly 50%. Finally, share repurchase. We purchased over $1 billion of shares in the fourth quarter for a total of $3.6 billion for fiscal year '22, and we have an opportunity to continue that trajectory heading into fiscal '23. So all in all, we're in a great position to grow our business execute on our Leap Ambitions and continue to return cash to shareholders.\n\nRachel Bach\n\nThanks, Josh. Brent, let's see what other questions our investors have.\n\nBrent Norwood\n\nDirector of IR, Deere & Company\n\nNow we are ready to begin the Q&A portion of the call.

I will now turn the call over to Rachel Bach.\n\nRachel Bach\n\nThanks, Brent. Good morning. John Deere achieved higher production rates in the third quarter, resulting in a 25% increase in net sales despite ongoing supply challenges. Financial results for the quarter included an 18% margin for the equipment operations. Ag fundamentals remain solid with our order books beginning to fill for model year '23 products, reflecting continued healthy demand as we look ahead. The construction and forestry markets also continue to benefit from demand, contributing to the division's strong performance in the quarter. Similarly, order books are now extending into 2023, providing visibility into the new year.\nSlide 3 shows the results for the second quarter. Net sales and revenues were up 22% to $14.1 billion, while net sales for the equipment operations were up 25% to $13 billion. Net income attributable to Deere & Company was $1.884 billion or $6.16 per diluted share.\nLooking at results by segment, beginning with our Production & Precision Ag business on Slide 4. Net sales of $6.096 billion were up 43% compared to the third quarter last year, largely due to higher production and shipment volumes. Price realization in the quarter was positive by about 15 points, whereas currency translation was negative by about 4 points. Operating profit was $1.293 billion, resulting in a 21% operating margin for the segment. The year-over-year increase in operating profit was primarily due to price realization and higher shipment volumes, partially offset by higher production costs and higher SA&G and R&D spend.\nThe production costs were mostly elevated material and freight. Overhead spend was also higher for the period as persistent supply challenges continue to cause production inefficiencies. Despite these challenges, factories were able to achieve higher rates of production and made progress on reducing the number of partially completed machines in inventory. Our factories are focused on finishing and shipping the remaining machines in the fourth quarter, which will help our progress toward restoring productivity and efficiencies going into next year. The increased SA&G and R&D spend reflects our continued development of our technology stack and our progress on our Leap Ambitions, both of which will unlock additional value for our customers.\nNext, Small Ag & Turf on Slide 5. Net sales were up 16%, totaling $3.635 billion in the third quarter due to higher shipment volumes and price realization more than offsetting negative currency translation. Price realization in the quarter was positive by 10 points while currency translation was negative by over 4 points. For the quarter, operating profit was down year-over-year at $552 million, resulting in a 15% operating margin. The decreased profit was primarily due to higher production costs, specifically materials, offset by price realization.\nTurning now to the industry outlook on Slide 6. We expect U.S. and Canada industry sales of large ag equipment to be up around 15%. While the industry continues to be constrained by supply, demand remains robust and our guidance assumes a heavier back-end loaded year for industry retail. Relative to the industry, we've had our strongest results in high-horsepower row crop tractors, and we plan to end the year approaching our highest market share on record. Our order books for the remainder of the current fiscal year are full, and we see signs of robust demand into 2023 with some order books already full through the first half of next year.\nSmall Ag & Turf industry demand continues to be estimated generally flat this year. While we see steadiness from our hay and forage segment, consumer products such as contact utility tractors and turf equipment are down due to supply constraints, low turf inventory and moderating demand.\nMoving on to Europe. The industry is forecasted to be roughly flat despite solid demand. While supply constraints and operating challenges are affecting the industry, we expect to finish the year with higher shipments and market share gains. In South America, we expect industry sales of tractors and combines to increase by about 10% to 15%. Despite the low trend in crop yields due to inclement weather, customers are very profitable this year, benefiting from high commodity prices. Industry sales in Asia are still forecasted to be down moderately as India, the world's largest tractor market by unit, has moderated from record volumes achieved in 2021.\nMoving on to our segment forecast on Slide 7. Production & Precision Ag net sales continue to be forecasted up between 25% and 30% in fiscal year '22. The forecast assumes nearly 14 points of positive price realization for the full year, which will allow us to be price/cost positive for the fiscal year. This is partially offset by roughly 2 points of currency headwind. For the segment's operating margin, our full year forecast is between 20% and 21%. The forecast reflects higher costs for material and freight inflation as well as the elevated overheads associated with the supply constraints that have introduced a number of factory inefficiencies this year.\nSlide 8 shows our forecast for the Small Ag & Turf segment. We now expect fiscal year '22 net sales to be up in the range of 10% to 15%. This guidance includes over 9 points of positive price realization, partially offset by 3 points of unfavorable currency impact. The segment's operating margin is now forecasted between 14% and 15%. The margin guidance reflects higher material costs and lower expectations for volume as small engine availability has been especially challenging. Price/cost remains neutral for the year.\nChanging to Construction & Forestry on Slide 9. For the quarter, net sales of $3.269 billion were up 8% due to price realization. Operating profit increased year-over-year to $514 million, resulting in a 16% operating margin. Favorable price realization offset higher production costs during the quarter. The production costs were mainly a result of elevated material and freight as well as higher overhead spend.\nNow let's take a look at our 2022 Construction & Forestry industry outlook on Slide 10. Industry sales of earthmoving equipment in North America are expected to be up approximately 10%, while the compact construction market is forecasted to be flat to down 5%. Though demand remains strong for compact construction products, the downward revision reflects extremely low levels of inventory and supply challenges constraining shipments. End markets for earthmoving are expected to remain strong as oil and gas activities remain steady, U.S. infrastructure spend begins to ramp and CapEx programs from the independent rental companies drive re-fleeting efforts. Housing starts have moderated though still remain elevated versus historical levels. Additionally, record low levels of new and used equipment will dampen any slowdown.\nIn Forestry, we now expect the industry to be flat to down 5%, primarily due to supply constraining the ability to meet demand. Global roadbuilding markets are expected to be flat to up 5%. Roadbuilding demand remains strongest in the Americas while China and Russia markets are down significantly. The C&F segment is on Slide 11. Deere's Construction & Forestry 2022 net sales are forecasted to be up around 10%. Our net sales guidance for the year includes about 10 points of positive price realization and 3 points of negative currency impact. The segment's operating margin outlook remains at a range of 15.5% to 16.5%.\nShifting over to our Financial Services operations on Slide 12. Worldwide Financial Services net income attributable to Deere & Company in the third quarter was $209 million. This is a slight decrease compared to the third quarter last year due to unfavorable discrete income tax adjustments, a higher provision for credit losses and lower gains on operating lease residual values. These were partially offset by income earned on a higher average portfolio. For fiscal year '22, we maintain our net income outlook at $870 million, slightly lower than fiscal year '21 due to a higher provision for credit losses, less favorable financing spreads and higher SA&G. The higher provisions for credit losses are primarily related to Russia. The segment is expected to continue to benefit from income earned on higher average portfolio balance. Overall, Financial Services continues to deliver steady results. Credit loss provisions, lease return rates and past dues are all in good shape, reflecting the solid balance sheet for our customers.\nSlide 13 outlines our guidance for net income, our effective tax rate and operating cash flow. For fiscal year '22, we adjusted our outlook for net income to be between $7 billion and $7.2 billion. The full year forecast is inclusive of the impact of higher raw material prices, higher logistics costs and production inefficiencies caused by supply disruptions. Our forecasted price realization is expected to outpace both material and freight costs for the entire year.\nMoving on to tax. Our guidance incorporates an effective tax rate projected to be between 21% and 23%. Lastly, cash flow from the equipment operations is now expected to be in the range of $5.3 billion to $5.5 billion. The decrease reflects the adjusted income forecast and increases in working capital required through the end of the fiscal year as we expect to maintain higher production levels heading into the first quarter of 2023.\nAt this time, let's discuss a few topics for the quarter in more detail. First, I would like to take a closer look at Production & Precision Ag's third quarter results, an impressive jump in net sales, both compared to the third quarter last year as well as compared to the second quarter this year. Net sales were up 43% year-over-year and up 19% sequentially, which is not our typical seasonality. Cory, can you talk through some of the factors that enabled us to achieve that?\n\nCory J. Reed\n\nPresident of Worldwide Ag & Turf Division, Production & Precision Ag for Americas and Australia, Deere & Company\n\nYes. Thanks, Rachel. There's really several contributing factors this quarter. First is higher production rates. If you look back at the first half of this year, we had a work stoppage in the first quarter and had to ramp up at several of our largest U.S. factories. We also had 2 new product introductions, the 9R 4-drive tractor and the X9 combine. During the third quarter, we ramped up and we achieved our highest production line rates yet this year across several large ag factories.\nSecond, as we started to ramp up through the second quarter, we continued to experience supply challenges, resulting in higher partially completed machines in inventory. We've procured the needed parts and made good progress in both finishing and shipping machines, reducing the number of partially completed machines in inventory. Now we did see overall inventories build slightly again in the third quarter, but that was mostly attributable to higher levels of raw inventory as we expect to maintain higher production rates, both through the fourth quarter and into Q1 of '23, which is different from our typical production wind-down in the fourth quarter.\nIt's important to note, we're focused on not adding more partially completed machines to inventory. We're making progress completing that inventory and getting it delivered to our dealers and customers. We've also been able to increase our parts inventory, which is helping us as we go into the fall to support our customers and their operations.\n\nRachel Bach\n\nGoing back to the higher production rates and even the partially completed inventory, we're seeing some modest improvement in the supply base. But overall, it's still very fragile and deliveries are still choppy.\n\nCory J. Reed\n\nPresident of Worldwide Ag & Turf Division, Production & Precision Ag for Americas and Australia, Deere & Company\n\nYes, that's right. We continue to prioritize getting equipment out to our customers. While past due deliveries from suppliers have declined a bit, they're still at elevated levels. Missing parts and late part deliveries result in rework to complete partially built machines and contribute to production inefficiencies and higher overhead costs. We're able to achieve the higher line rates despite the continued difficulties and constraints within the supply chain. We're proactively working with our supply base to obtain allocations and improve on-time deliveries of parts, looking for opportunities to dual-source or providing resources to address constraints. Again, all so we can get equipment out to our dealers and customers.\n\nJosh Jepsen\n\nThis is Josh. Maybe one thing to add. As Cory mentioned, we've been focused on producing at higher levels in order to get products to customers, which has resulted in higher costs related to supply availability, inflationary pressures, overhead inefficiencies. So maybe for example, we've incurred expedited freight and experienced production inefficiencies. Expedited freight comes at a premium.\nAnd any time we have to touch machines or move them in our factories more than once, it comes at a cost. In that respect, 2022 has been a challenge, given the ramp in demand juxtaposed with the lost production in the first quarter and a challenging supply environment. So we've really been chasing production all year as a result.\nImportantly, we're seeing the benefit of getting those products in the hands of our customers reflected in market share and retail statistics. So we feel like we're broadly outperforming the industry. As we look forward, we'll build at higher levels of production in Q4 and into 1Q '23, which will help with our inefficiencies while also taking actions on costs that we've incurred over the last few years.\n\nRachel Bach\n\nYes, all good points, Josh. You both now mentioned higher production rates achieved during the third quarter are expected to carry forward. It's too early to guide for fiscal year 2023, but let's spend a little more time there. Cory, can you share some insights from our customers' perspective to provide some context as we look ahead?\n\nCory J. Reed\n\nPresident of Worldwide Ag & Turf Division, Production & Precision Ag for Americas and Australia, Deere & Company\n\nSure. Overall, ag fundamentals remain really strong. Corn and soy prices have declined from a few months ago but so have inputs like fertilizer and others. Also when you look at global stocks to use, it's tight and it's expected to decline again, continuing to support elevated crop prices. It may also take a couple of seasons to recover those grain stocks to normal levels. So while profitability may come in a bit from record '22 levels, our customers will still be profitable, and the environment is supportive of replacement demand especially when you consider that farmers haven't been able to replenish their fleets as much as they wanted to this year. The age of the fleet remains above average. Additionally, dealer inventories remain at historic lows since the industry shorted demand the last couple of years due to supply constraints. These factors should help extend the duration of the replacement cycle.\n\nRachel Bach\n\nAnd how has that been factoring into our crop care early order book that opened in June, so sprayers and planters?\n\nCory J. Reed\n\nPresident of Worldwide Ag & Turf Division, Production & Precision Ag for Americas and Australia, Deere & Company\n\nAs you may recall from last year, we basically filled the full year production in the first phase of the EOP. We didn't do a second or third phase like we've done in the past. Then with the work stoppage and supply challenges, we've delivered a portion of those orders after their seasonal use this year. So this year's program is structured differently with 2 phases, both of which are on allocation. These phases are only intended to source orders for pre-seasonal use deliveries. We'll run yet another phase later for post-seasonal shipments. So year-over-year, EOP results won't be comparable due to the different structures we're running this year versus last.\n\nRachel Bach\n\nAnd how about tractors?\n\nCory J. Reed\n\nPresident of Worldwide Ag & Turf Division, Production & Precision Ag for Americas and Australia, Deere & Company\n\nWe're also sold ahead on tractors well into the second quarter next year. And our new and used inventories for all large tractors are sitting at multiyear lows with products like the 9R tractor going through both the work stoppage and new product transition. The momentum for all large tractors coming out of the third quarter on production rates will carry forward through the fourth quarter and well into next year. Demand is strong and still outstripping supply in 2023. Bottom line, we fully expect to produce more large ag equipment next year than we did this year.\n\nBrent Norwood\n\nDirector of IR, Deere & Company\n\nYes. And let me add that these expectations around higher production rates are reflected in our revised cash flow outlook for this year, which we lowered a little bit due to increased working capital. We don't plan to see our normal seasonal reduction in inventory. And to help offset some of the supply challenges and maintain the higher production rates through the fourth quarter and into the next year, we're carrying a little bit more raw inventory heading out of 2022.\n\nRachel Bach\n\nThanks, Brent. That is important to note. The inventory increases are not replacing partially completed inventory but increasing raw inventory as we prepare for that continued higher production rate. This is different than what we've seen seasonally in the past. So Cory, before we move on, what are we seeing on take rates in the model year '23 early order programs?\n\nCory J. Reed\n\nPresident of Worldwide Ag & Turf Division, Production & Precision Ag for Americas and Australia, Deere & Company\n\nYes, it's good across the board. Customers are seeing the value and technology in the advanced solutions that we're offering. We saw increases in take rates for ExactEmerge on our planters to nearly 60%, and ExactApply for sprayers jumped over 10 points to 65% take rate. Tech products like our premium activations for tractors and sprayers are nearing 100% adoption by our customers.\n\nRachel Bach\n\nGreat, thank you. Now I'd like to spend some time on the industry outlook. U.S. and Canada large ag is projected to be up about 10 -- about 15% on a unit basis. It's been a common theme across the industry. AEM retail data is choppy month-to-month and by product and impacted by when the products are able to get shipped, so less reflective of demand right now. Our model year '23 order books reflect that, too. Demand has remained resilient as ag fundamentals remained positive. We've been able to ship more product in the third quarter and are forecasting to outpace the industry for full year, indicating some market share gains in the U.S. and Canada large ag space. Cory, what about Europe?\n\nCory J. Reed\n\nPresident of Worldwide Ag & Turf Division, Production & Precision Ag for Americas and Australia, Deere & Company\n\nYes, Europe is another region where demand continues to outpace what the industry can supply. The industry has seen a lot of production challenges in Europe due to supply chain issues, geopolitical events and other disruptions as well. It's the same story of partially completed machines waiting for parts or even, in some cases, completed machines just waiting on an outbound truck. For us though, despite all of that, Europe has remained a bright spot. The team has executed really well. We've been outperforming the industry, so we're on track to grow high-horsepower tractor, combine and SPFH share there as well.\n\nRachel Bach\n\nAnd what about South America?\n\nCory J. Reed\n\nPresident of Worldwide Ag & Turf Division, Production & Precision Ag for Americas and Australia, Deere & Company\n\nWe're seeing strong profitability for our customers and strong market demand, which has outpaced industry production in 2022, particularly in Brazil, where we're releasing production monthly to maintain tight controls between inflation and pricing. And we're seeing our calendars fill up within hours of releasing them. We fully expect this strong demand cycle in Brazil will continue in 2023.\nOn top of that, our precision ag engagement in the region also continues to accelerate. South America is experiencing the fastest growth in engaged acres of anywhere in the world. And technologies such as ExactEmerge are accelerating across the region. Historically, we've had an objective to put South American profitability on par with Region IV. We're now meeting and exceeding that goal.\n\nRachel Bach\n\nGreat. Thanks, Cory. I think that's helpful insight to how our net sales guides reconcile to the industry guides. Our net sales guide includes not only higher price but also stronger volumes and higher take rates of precision ag solutions. Brent, what about Small Ag & Turf? The industry is expected to be flat compared to our net sales guide of up 10% to 15%.\n\nBrent Norwood\n\nDirector of IR, Deere & Company\n\nYes, I think we really need to parse it out a little bit. If we look at the parts of our business that are linked to the ag economy like midsized tractors versus consumer products like compact utility tractors, there's different stories going on there.\nFirst, with midsized tractors linked more to hay and forage markets, livestock and dairy margins, they've all remained pretty steady. High protein and dairy prices have helped offset some of the higher feed and input costs that we're seeing.\nSo we do see continued demand for our products like the 6 Series tractors, and this is a positive contributor in terms of our mix for Small Ag & Turf. On the other hand, consumer products are beginning to soften as they are more closely linked to the general economy. So equipment inventory -- so while equipment inventories remain well below normal levels, they're starting to see a rise a little bit for small tractors. So we're monitoring these inventory levels closely. But restocking the channel should moderate slowing in the retail demand that we're seeing, especially in turf, which hasn't seen much of any increase in inventories just yet.\n\nRachel Bach\n\nThanks. I touched on C&F industry outlook earlier. Josh, anything to add for C&F?\n\nJosh Jepsen\n",
        "content2": "Sure. In North America, while we're seeing indicators of housing moderate a bit, earthmoving and roadbuilding are helped by steady oil and gas and the U.S. infrastructure beginning to ramp up. In fact, in North America, it's really been a bright spot for roadbuilding. China and Russia are down for roadbuilding, and we're beginning to see some softening in Europe, but North America is offsetting much of that. And that mix is contributing to some really good margins for roadbuilding, which are the best we've seen since the acquisition.\n\nRachel Bach\n\nThanks, Josh. Raj, before we transition to the Q&A portion, any summary comments?\n\nRajesh Kalathur\n\nCFO, Deere & Company\n\nSure, Rachel. A few things. First, I want to acknowledge the extraordinary efforts by our production and operations employees to ramp up factory output while finishing and shipping a portion of the partially completed inventory while continuing to manage through supply challenges. The dedication to getting products to our customers is just phenomenal.\nYes, through the third quarter, we continued to see elevated costs and production inefficiencies, but we also demonstrated higher line rates and those rates will continue through the fourth quarter and into next fiscal year to meet customer demand. Next, I want to highlight the $1.2 billion of shares we repurchased during the third quarter. It's a testament to our use of cash philosophy. We will continue to be proactive with buybacks and opportunistic with volatility in the market.\nAs we look ahead, we plan to continue the momentum we built during the third quarter into the fourth quarter and beyond, which continue to be dependent on supply chain performance. As Josh mentioned, we are taking steps to reduce the impact of a persistently volatile supply chain, allowing us to focus on improving production inefficiencies and managing material costs as we pivot to 2023. Demand remains strong in multiple end markets, and we continue to see strong demand for our technologies and precision solutions. Finally, through our smart industrial strategy and execution of our Leap Ambitions, we will continue to unlock more value for our customers, leaving our best years still to come.\n\nJosh Jepsen\n\nNow we are ready to begin the Q&A portion of the call. The operator will instruct you on the polling procedure. (Operator Instructions) Operator?"

(Operator Instructions)\nI would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Brent Norwood, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.\n\nBrent Norwood\n\nDirector of IR, Deere & Company\n\nHello. Also on the call today are Ryan Campbell, Chief Financial Officer; Josh Jepsen, Deputy Financial Officer; Galia Barr, Director of Corporate Economics; and Rachel Bach, Manager of Investor Communications. Today, we'll take a closer look at Deere's second quarter earnings, then spend some time talking about our markets and our current outlook for the fiscal year 2022. After that, we'll respond to your questions. Please note that slides are available to complement the call this morning.

This call also may include financial measures that are not in conformance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, GAAP. Additional information concerning these measures, including reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures, is included in the release and posted on our website at johndeere.com/earnings under Quarterly Earnings & Events.\nI will now turn the call over to Rachel Bach.\n\nRachel Bach\n\nThanks, Brent, and good morning. John Deere completed the second quarter with sound execution despite being constrained by persistent supply challenges. Financial results for the quarter included a 19.9% margin for the equipment operations. Ag fundamentals remain solid, with our order books largely full through the balance of the year and demand starting to build for our model year '23 products. Furthermore, the construction and forestry markets also continued to benefit from strong demand and price realization, contributing to the division's solid performance in the quarter.\nSlide 3 shows the results for the second quarter. Net sales and revenues were up 11% to $13.37 billion, while net sales for the equipment operations were up 9% to $12.034 billion. Net income attributable to Deere & Company was $2.098 billion or $6.81 per diluted share.\nTaking a closer look at our production and precision ag business on Slide 4. Net sales of $5.117 billion were up 13% compared to the second quarter last year primarily due to price realization and higher shipment volumes. Price realization in the quarter was positive by about 11 points. Operating profit was $1.057 billion, resulting in a 20% -- 21% operating margin for the segment. The year-over-year increase in operating profit was primarily due to price realization and higher shipment volumes partially offset by higher production costs and higher R&D spend. The production costs were mostly elevated material and freight. Supply challenges also contributed to production inefficiencies, driving higher overheads for the period.\nThe increased R&D spend reflects our continued focus on developing and integrating technology solutions into our equipment and unlocking value for our customers. Operating profit for the quarter was also negatively impacted by an impairment of $46 million related to the events of Russia to Ukraine.\nNext, small ag and turf on Slide 5. Net sales were up 5%, totaling $3.57 billion in the second quarter as price realization more than offset negative currency translation. Price realization in the quarter was positive by just over 8 points, while currency translation was negative by about 2 points.\nFor the quarter, operating profit was down year-over-year at $520 million, resulting in a 14.6% operating margin. The decreased profit was primarily due to higher production costs, specifically material, and an unfavorable sales mix. These items were partially offset by price realization.\nTo share more perspective on the current global ag and turf industry and fundamentals, I'm happy to be joined today by Galia Barr, Director of Corporate Economics. Galia?\n\nKanlaya Barr\n\nThanks, Rachel. Turning to Slide 6. I would first like to take a few moments to talk through some points that are influencing the global industry. Global stock for grains and oilseeds have declined over the past 3 seasons, and we expect to see significant less production and export out of the Black Sea region. And on the demand side, there was an increase of imports into China as China's hog herd recovered. So both supply and demand factors are leading to higher crop prices as reflected in the recent WASDE release. Meanwhile, growers are experiencing input cost inflation and availability concerns, most notably with fertilizer. Though row crop producers are experiencing higher input costs, many purchased input in advance of the recent inflation and are marketing their crops at unlimited prices. As a result, growers continue to experience strong profitability and cash flow. While farmers expect another year of high input costs in 2023, global grains and oilseeds prices have risen enough to deliver healthy margin profit into the next season.\nWith respect to farm equipment. 2 consecutive years of industry-wide production constraints have resulted in further aging of the fleet. The higher-than-average fleet age, coupled with low channel inventory, is contributing to pent-up demand and is likely to remain beyond fiscal '22.\nWith this backdrop of continued strong ag fundamentals, we expect U.S. and Canada industry sales of large ag equipment to be up approximately 20%. Order books for the remainder of the current fiscal year are mostly full, and we already see signs of strong demand for model year '23 equipment, with some order books opening in June.\nSmall ag and turf industry demand continues to be forecasted to be about flat this year. We are seeing moderate increases from our hay and forage segment, while consumer products are lower due to supply constraints and low inventory in the channel. Rising interest rates will likely impact home sales and home improvement spending in North America, although we expect them to remain elevated. Equipment inventories remain well below normal and are unlikely to begin recovering until 2023.\nNow moving on to Europe. The industry is forecasted to be up roughly 5% as higher commodity prices strengthen business condition in the arable segment. We expect the industry will continue to face supply-based constraints, resulting in demand (inaudible) production for the year. At this time, our order book extends through the duration of fiscal '22 and even into early fiscal '23 for some product lines.\nIn South America, we expect industry sales of tractors and combines to increase by approximately 10%. Despite low -- the low trend crop yield due to weather, our customers are very profitable this year, benefiting from high commodity prices. Our order book reflects the strong sentiment and are nearly full for most product lines.\nIndustry sales in Asia are forecasted to be down moderately as India, which is the world's largest tractor market by unit, moderates from record volume achieved in 2021.\nI will now turn the call back to Rachel.\n\nRachel Bach\n\nThanks, Galia. Moving on to our segment forecast, beginning on Slide 7. Production and precision ag net sales continue to be forecasted up between 25% and 30% in fiscal year '22. The forecast assumes about 13 points of positive price realization for the full year, which will allow us to be price/cost positive for the fiscal year. Additionally, we expect roughly 1 point of currency headwind. For the segment's operating margin, our full year forecast remains between 21% and 22%, reflecting consistently solid financial performance across all geographic regions.\nSlide 8 shows our forecast for the small ag and turf segment. We expect net sales in fiscal year '22 to be up about 15%. This guidance includes over 8 points of positive price realization and 3 points of currency headwind. The segment's operating margin is forecasted to be between 15.5% and 16.5%. Although price/cost remains positive, for the year, supply challenges as well as higher material and freight costs are expected to continue to put pressure on margins.\nTurning to construction and forestry on Slide 9. For the quarter, net sales of $3.347 billion were up 9%, largely due to price realization and higher shipment volumes. Operating profit increased year-over-year to $814 million, resulting in a 24% operating margin. During the quarter, there was a onetime gain of $326 million investment remeasurement from the Hitachi transaction. Results were also impacted by a $47 million impairment related to the events in Russia and Ukraine. Excluding those special items, operating margin would have been 16%.\nHigher production costs and an unfavorable product mix were detrimental to the quarter results. The production costs were mainly a result of higher material and freight.\nNow let's take a look at our 2022 construction and forestry industry outlook on Slide 10. Industry sales of earthmoving equipment in North America are expected to be up approximately 10%, while the compact construction market is forecast to be flat to up 5%. End markets for earthmoving and compact equipment are expected to remain strong as the U.S. housing market is forecasted to remain elevated.\nOil and gas activities continue to ramp up, and strong CapEx programs from the independent rental companies drive refleeting efforts. Compact construction equipment inventory levels are extremely low due to supply constraints affecting those product lines.\nIn forestry, we now expect the industry to be flat to up 5%, and global roadbuilding markets are also expected to be flat to up 5%. Roadbuilding demand in the Americas remains strong, while China and Russia markets are down significantly.\nThe C&F segment outlook is on Slide 11. Deere's construction and forestry 2022 net sales continue to be forecasted up between 10% and 15%. Our net sales guidance for the year includes 9 points of positive price realization and 2 points of negative currency impact. The segment's operating margin outlook has been revised to a range of 15.5% to 16.5%. The update reflects the onetime gain from the Deere-Hitachi transaction and the impairment related to the events in Russia and Ukraine that occurred in the second quarter of 2022. The normal course of business continues to benefit from increases in price and volume.\nShifting over to our financial services operations on Slide 12. Worldwide financial services net income attributable to Deere & Company in the second quarter was $208 million. This is a slight decrease compared to the second quarter last year, primarily due to the higher reserves for credit losses, partially offset by income earned on a higher average portfolio. For fiscal year '22, we maintain our net income outlook at $870 million as the segment is expected to continue to benefit from income earned on a higher average portfolio balance.\nSlide 13 outlines our guidance for net income, our effective tax rate and operating cash flow. For fiscal year '22, we are raising our outlook for net income to be between $7 billion and $7.4 billion, reflecting the onetime items in the second quarter of this year. The full year forecast is inclusive of the impact of higher raw material prices and logistics costs. At this time, our forecasted price realization is expected to outpace both material and freight costs for the entire year. The first 2 quarters are expected to be our most difficult material and freight inflationary cost compares, while the third quarter comparison to last year should improve slightly.\nAs we progress into the fourth quarter, we expect those material and freight comparisons to improve even further. We also expect shipments to be more back half weighted than we've seen historically as we work through a backlog of partially built inventory waiting for supply parts and while seasonal factories will continue to produce without the typical shutdown periods.\nMoving on to tax. Our guidance incorporates an effective tax rate projected to be between 22% and 24%.\nLastly, cash flow from the equipment operations is now expected to be in the range of $5.6 billion to $6 billion. The decrease in the forecast reflects the increases in working capital required through the year.\nAt this time, I would like to turn the call over to Ryan Campbell, Chief Financial Officer, for comments. Ryan?\n\nRyan D. Campbell\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Deere & Company\n\nBefore we transition to the Q&A portion, I would like to make a few remarks on our results and the opportunities ahead of us.\nReflecting on the second quarter results. As we indicated in our prior earnings call and outlook, the supply chain-related constraints continued through the quarter and will not likely abate during this fiscal year. With respect to our forecast, excluding the special items in the second quarter, our operational guidance remains roughly unchanged.\nI want to commend our employees, dealers and suppliers for their efforts to support customers and deliver products as quickly as possible in this dynamic environment.\nGiven the strong fundamentals in agriculture, coupled with the underlying supply constraints, we do not see the industry being able to meet all of the demand that exists in 2022. While difficult to quantify exactly the impact of this, we expect 2023 to be another strong year of industry demand.\nStrategically, each day that passes gives us more confidence in our smart industrial strategy and our recently announced Leap Ambitions. While we are hard at work managing our operations in this dynamic environment, we are also executing on our strategy. Our production systems teams continue to identify and execute against opportunities to drive both economic and sustainable value for our customers and their operations. This is even more critical in an environment where inputs are significantly increasing in costs and/or hard to come by.\n\nRachel Bach\n\nThanks, Ryan. Now before we open the line for Q&A, I would like to dive deeper into a few important topics for the quarter.\nLet's start with our full year revenue guidance. The top line forecast implies a second half shipment schedule that is higher than the first half. Brent, what factors led to this? And how does Deere plan to deliver on a back half-loaded year?\n\nBrent Norwood\n\nDirector of IR, Deere & Company\n\nYes. First, I'll spend a few minutes talking about some of the factors in the first half of the year. The first quarter was unusually low due to the work stoppage that we experienced. So we expected the delivery schedule would be seasonally different earlier in the year.\nWe also had 2 large new product programs that we're ramping up to full production in the first half, the X9 combine and the 9R tractor. And our production's plans always reflected higher volumes of these products later in the year.\nTypically, we see -- we have some of our seasonal factories that take shutdowns in the second half of the year. However, this year, we'll see some of our PPA, production and precision ag, factories producing through much of the third and fourth quarter. Overall, we expect to have more production days in the second half of 2022 than the previous year, and we expect to grow production progressively from the second quarter through the fourth quarter, meaning we expect Q4 to be our highest revenue quarter for the year.\nAdditionally, supply disruptions led to inefficiencies at factories, resulting in unusually high inventory of partially completed machines. As soon as we get parts, we will be able to complete and ship product, providing confidence in the second half shipment schedule.\nOur guidance does contemplate getting enough parts to fulfill the production schedule. As Ryan mentioned, we are collaborating with suppliers and our factories and are working hard to make sure we get there.\n\nJosh Jepsen\n\nThis is Josh. Maybe one thing to add there. We're seeing some of this play out in the AEM retail data as well where you see some categories down year-to-date but choppiness in the month-to-month retails. The decrease in certain categories is not reflective of changes in demand, but more -- the challenges we're seeing in getting products shipped and not just us, but across the industry, given the current environment in supply.\n\nRachel Bach\n\nGreat. Thank you. Next, let's discuss how margins will progress throughout the year, especially in the context of price and material freight costs. Can you talk a little bit more about how we should think about margins in the second half versus the first half? Brent, how do you expect the rest of the year to unfold?\n\nBrent Norwood\n\nDirector of IR, Deere & Company\n\nSo we experienced the most difficult material and freight compares in the first half of 2022. Lagging contracts on steel means we have seen progressively higher costs since third quarter 2021. Other costs are ramping as well. Commodities such as copper and aluminum, electronics and even things like labor and energy are increasing. We'll begin to anniversary some of these cost increases in the third and fourth quarter. So we'll see easier compares relative to the previous year.\nFreight remains elevated, too. Recent COVID lockdowns in China have caused delays in shipping globally, compounding some of the previous logistics bottlenecks. With the supply chain backed up, we're utilizing significantly more airfreight solutions, and we expect this to continue throughout the second half of 2022.\nIn addition to material and freight, overhead has increased. This has come from the choppiness in the supply base and is particularly evident in the number of partially completed machines in our inventory that are missing parts required to be complete.\nSo while the compare gets easier, we probably won't see much moderation in material and freight costs this year. Fortunately, price realization should get progressively better, potentially making the fourth quarter the highest margin period for us, which is a bit atypical.\nWe have managed our order books differently than we have in the past, enabling us to adapt to changes in inflation. So as noted earlier, we expect our price for the full year will more than offset increases in material and freight.\n\nRachel Bach\n\nThanks, Brent. Let's take a closer look at ag fundamentals. Galia, can you share more insight?\n\nKanlaya Barr\n\nSure. Let's start with the global stock for grain oilseeds, which we have seen decline over the last 3 seasons, and that's driven by both the supply/demand side.\nNow looking at the demand side, we experienced a large increase in Chinese import, and that's starting in the year -- crop year 2021 as China's hog herd recovered from the African swine fever. And now on the supply side, the world experiencing significant damage to crop 2 consecutive years, that was in 2021 crop year and also 2022 crop year as well, and in multiple locations: in North America, South America, parts of the CIS. So together, strong demand and declining supply led to the higher price that we're experiencing over the past 2 years.\nNow expected lower production of crop from the Black Sea region adds to the challenges that the (inaudible) already faces. The region accounts for almost about 1/3 of global wheat exports as well as a notable source of corn exports. USDA forecast production and export for wheat and corn to be almost 50% lower for '22/'23 crop year from the Black Sea region. And in fact, the potential export loss could impact 2 crop years. And as a result, right now, wheat ending stocks among key exporters could fall below 50 million tons, which is the lowest level in 15 years.\nNow looking at the fertilizer prices, which have climbed in some markets or experiencing scarcities of this critical input. Persistent fertilizer constraints and high price will lead the supply chain to adjust, but this is likely going to take some time. If you put these factors together, while row crop producers are experiencing high input costs, many have purchased input in advance of recent inflation and were able to market their crops at a high price, which helped mitigate the higher input costs. And also a tight global supply will likely remain supportive of prices next year, which is helping to sustain some more profitability.\nNow given this backdrop of elevated commodity prices, combined with 2 consecutive years of constrained machinery production, we have older fleet age and low channel inventory, the fundamentals for agriculture machinery remain favorable.\n\nJosh Jepsen\n\nThanks, Galia. And maybe just to punctuate all of that. We're seeing strong demand as we look into model year '23 orders and even begin to take orders in 1Q '23 for certain products in different geographies. So we're expecting continued demand to be a tailwind going into '23.\n\nRachel Bach\n\nAs a follow-up to that, our technology helps alleviate some of the pressure that Galia talked about on the input costs by enabling the customer to use less while still achieving yields.\n\nJosh Jepsen\n\nThat's right. And traditionally, in ag, to boost yields, we've seen an approach that had to be do more with more. Both rising input costs, our customers are looking at how they can do more with less. And they're looking to us and the strategy that we've been talking about over the last few years. Using less inputs, but not losing out on yields, or in some cases, using less input and increasing yields.\nSo for example, we introduced a product called ExactRate last year, which applies liquid nitrogen at the time of planting. This helps our customers get more precise with fertilizer usage, which has been a unit -- input experiencing rapid inflation this year. Not only can this reduce the cost, but also improves our customers' nitrogen efficiencies, unlocking significant environmental benefits as well as helping yield by applying nutrients when the seed needs it most. So not only do we see continued strong demand, but the demand for our precision ag solutions as our customers look for opportunities to do more with less.\n\nRachel Bach\n\nThanks, Josh. And speaking of precision ag and technology, Deere announced a few acquisitions during the quarter. Ryan, can you share more?\n\nRyan D. Campbell\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Deere & Company\n\nSure, Rachel. Consistent with the themes that we've previously discussed of digitization, automation, autonomy, life cycle, electrification and sustainability, we've executed during the quarter to expand our access to talent, technology and business opportunities in these areas.\nI'd like to highlight one investment, GUSS Automation, which is a pioneer in semi-autonomous spraying for high-value crops. GUSS Automation brings an in-depth knowledge of HVC customers and innovative solutions that deal with some of the most pressing issues facing that segment today. We look forward to working together on further collaboration with the Deere sales channel and in other areas that drive value for HVC customers.\nI highlight this investment as it is illustrative of the new smart industrial strategy focused on production systems. Our teams work to deeply understand customer production systems and how to deliver better outcomes, both from an economic and sustainability perspective, then we work to deliver a differentiated solutions.\nSometimes we'll design to deliver that solution organically. Other times, we'll invest, partner or acquire unique capabilities to accelerate that delivery. Overall, you'll see us continue to aggressively expand our capabilities to deliver differentiated customer value, and we will dive deeper into this at our Tech Day on May 26.\n\nBrent Norwood\n\nDirector of IR, Deere & Company\n\nNow we are ready to begin the Q&A portion of the call. The operator will instruct you on the polling procedure. (Operator Instructions)"
