My name is Diego, and I will be your conference operator today. I would like to welcome everyone to the Starbucks Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. I will now turn the conference call over to Tiffany Willis, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Willis, you may now begin your conference.\n\nTiffany Willis\n\nVice President of Head of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Diego. Good afternoon, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today to discuss Starbucks' third quarter fiscal year 2024 results. Today's discussion will be led by Laxman Narasimhan, Chief Executive Officer; and Rachel Ruggeri, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nThis conference call will include forward-looking statements which are subject to various risks and uncertainties that can cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. Any such statements should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements in our earnings release and risk factors discussed in our filings with the SEC, including our latest annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly report on Form 10-Q.\nStarbucks assumes no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements or information. GAAP results in third quarter fiscal year 2024 as comparative period include several items related to strategic actions, including restructuring and impairment charges and other items. These items are excluded from our non-GAAP results.

And lastly, for your planning purposes, please note that our fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2024 earnings conference call has been tentatively scheduled for Wednesday, October 30, 2024. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Laxman.\n\nLaxman Narasimhan\n\nChief Executive Officer - Elect\n\nThank you, Tiffany, and thank you for joining us this afternoon. Let me start by laying out our results for this quarter. Our Q3 total company revenue was $9.1 billion, up 1% year-over-year and 6% over Q2. We -- our global comparable store sales declined 3% year-over-year, driven by a negative 2% comp growth in North America and a negative 14% comp growth in China and partially offset by strong performance in Japan.\nOur global operating margins contracted by 70 basis points to 16.7% and overall earnings per share for the quarter was $0.93. And -- our total company results were in line with guidance, but international performance, particularly in China, was challenged. We are not satisfied with the results, but our actions are making an impact. Leading business and operational indicators are trending in the right direction ahead of our financial results, and our runway for improvement is long.\nWe see green shoots in our U.S. business driven by the 3-part action plan outlined last quarter. First, meet and unlock capacity for new demand through a relentless focus and improvements to our U.S. store operations and on elevating the experience we create for our partners and customers; second, attract new customers and drive transaction growth by launching and integrating more exciting new products with relevant marketing, while maintaining our focus on core coffee forward offerings; and third, reach new customers and demonstrate our value by making sure customers believe that Starbucks Experience is worth it every time.\nFirst, our largest opportunity, meet and unlock capacity for new demand, a relentless focus on improving operational execution across our nearly 10,000 U.S. company-operated stores is the cornerstone of our near-term plan. While it is early days of progress, our plan is working. If you walk away from today's call with 1 thought, let it be the significant changes and long-term upside potential taking place within our U.S. stores and across our end-to-end supply chain to unlock growth, enhance the customer experience and drive cost efficiencies.\nWithin our stores, we've seen material positive momentum across core store health and performance metrics with notable improvements in partner scheduling and turnover, critical store issues and inventory management. Stores ranked in our top 2 operational performance quartiles reached a new high during the quarter, a 28% upwards shift from Q2, but we have more opportunity.\nOur focus on operational excellence, driven by our reinvention plan has led to a multi-second year-over-year improvement in out of the window times. The nearly 50% reduction in calls received by a customer contact center for my order took too long and Mobile Order & Pay and delivery uptime rates of 99%. These are key indicators of our work to drive growth by addressing customer wait times, product availability and the customer experience.\nThis quarter, we also introduced Phase 1 of our Siren Craft Systems, which includes several process and partner-driven enhancements to our U.S. store operations. Changes include a new peak time play collar role, strategic investments in partner hours, training, new routines, simple enhancements to technology and an evolved beverage build process.\nEarly deployment across 1,200 stores demonstrated a material incremental improvement across key performance, throughput, efficiency and reliability metrics. Encouraged by this, we fully deployed Siren Craft System's process improvements across our entire portfolio of U.S. company-operated stores this week.\nLater this quarter, we will begin rolling out a simple refit to our espresso machines, which we expect to improve espresso throughput by up to 15% without compromising quality. And with a minor software change in our store production systems, we have a similar ability to improve food throughput. When paired with Siren System equipment announced as part of our reinvention plan, these new processes become a force multiplier that we expect to drive a true step change improvement. Early assessments demonstrate the capability to drive a 10 to 20 second wait time reduction and a resulting comp opportunity range of 1% to 1.5%.\nLeveraging our Deep Brew analytics platform, we have identified customer experience outlier stores, approximately 10% of our network and have developed targeted plans to address and improve them, including accelerated Siren System deployment. Similarly, we are accelerating the pace of our new store builds and renovations with 580 net new bills and more than 800 renovations planned in North America for FY 2024.\nWe -- Store development efforts are focused on Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities, where we see population growth and forecast both underserved demand and high incrementality. Increasingly, these new store builds and renovations also include Siren system equipment. In line with prior guidance, we remain on track to deploy equipment in less than 10% of company-operated stores by the end of FY 2024 and about 40% by the end of FY 2026.\nBuilding on our pilot, Starbucks and Gopuff have agreed to terms for an expanded relationship to open 100 delivery-only kitchens across the U.S. We're also accelerating the rollout of digital story boards with target deployment across most U.S. stores in the next 2 years, a year earlier than originally anticipated.\nLastly, we're working on other ways to enhance the cafe experience. This includes new and expanded seating options that elevate many stores while upholding a safe and inviting place for partners and customers.\nA key outcome of our operational efforts has been material and sustained improvements to the partner experience. Driven by precision partner-centric staffing and scheduling efforts, we ended the quarter with a new post-pandemic low partner turnover rate. The best shift completion rate in 2 years and a 13% improvement in average hours per partner, now the highest on record. These initiatives create more stability in our stores, provide more predictability for our partners and sustain our experience flywheel.\nLooking beyond our stores, we continue to realize new efficiencies, cost savings and performance improvements across our end-to-end supply chain, thanks to strong support from our suppliers, and we see even more headroom. We have a structured process to realize significant continued improvements across our end-to-end supply chain. We are ahead of plan on productivity. We expect our productivity to drive efficiency and unlock capital from areas that don't touch the customer.\nIn turn, these savings will enable us to target investments that drive value for our customers beginning later in Q4, reigniting our North America flywheel for growth. We're early days on this journey, building both our strategic sourcing and revenue management capabilities.\nOur second priority is to drive demand through relevant product innovation of coffee at our core. We've seen meaningful improvement here as well. This quarter, we drove traffic into our stores through an engaging and innovative pipeline of products, supported by integrated marketing campaigns. Core share was up 1% year-over-year, representing 76% of our beverage mix through the quarter. Our newly formulated iced coffee received positive feedback. Our strength in cold espresso innovation continued to drive the platform's growth, up 4% year-over-year. And we launched Starbucks Milano Duetto whole bean coffee in Milan ahead of a global launch this October.\nBeyond coffee, our new Summer-Berry Starbucks Refreshers, beverages with Pearls drove the highest week 1 product launch in our history. Their success buoyed the entire Starbucks Refreshers beverage platform to an all-time high during the quarter. As mentioned in Q2, we continue to build out our 24-month product pipeline while accelerating our pace of innovation.\nFor example, recognized the growing appeal and opportunity created by the energy category, we launched a new handcrafted Iced Energy beverages across our U.S. stores in just 3 months compared to a normal 12 to 18.\nLooking forward, we believe our Q4 product offerings, including the return of Pumpkin Spice, combined with supporting marketing activities and offers provides the right formula to drive customer interest, demand and deeper engagement with both new and existing customers.\nOur third and final near-term priority is to reach new customers and demonstrate the value we offer by ensuring the Starbucks experience as worth it every time. Recognizing the premium position of our brand we've been measured in our use of offers.\nDuring this quarter, only 14% of our transactions were driven by offers compared to a competitive average of 29%. And of offer-driven transactions, 10% was star-based offers targeted to Starbucks Rewards members. Only 4% were driven by price-based offers. Our best offers are in the app. Together offers and other integrated marketing activities were paired with exciting product innovation successfully grew Starbucks Rewards membership, reactivated many lapse towards members and drove customer traffic on promotional days and product launch weeks.\nActive U.S. Starbucks Rewards members grew to 33.8 million during the quarter. Members across every decile increased the frequency of their visits. We're focused on the continued growth of the program because the average active member spends materially more annually and drives a higher lifetime value for the business than a nonmember.\nResearch also tells us that the most inactive Starbucks Rewards members don't realize they've lapsed. This demonstrates a continued opportunity to drive return visits, active member growth and deeper customer loyalty. Looking forward, we will continue to use more targeted offers coupled with select pricing actions, funded by efficiency initiatives to drive traffic and conversion.\nWe plan to leverage a mix of paid media, acquisition and retention offers to stop to signage and partner education to drive transactions and increase the frequency of visits with a focus on product launches and continued Starbucks towards member growth.\nIt's worth remembering the ubiquity of the Starbucks brand and our ability to intercept customers. For instance, our business is up 13% in airports and up 9% in hotels, pointing to these trends, leveraging our brand and our ability to intersect customers while demonstrating value, not just in price, but with the premium experience, remains a sizable opportunity across our entire store portfolio.\nMoving on to digital. As part of our action plan, we made continued improvements to our Starbucks app, including wait time algorithm enhancements that have improved order ready accuracy by nearly 50 percentage points. This combined with in-app offers helped drive a 10% year-over-year growth in mobile order and pay revenue, and a 7% year-over-year increase in MOP transactions. Looking deeper, our data shows that 1 in 4 non-Starbucks Rewards members want the ability to use mobile order pay. Nearly 80% of those customers don't want to join a rewards program or create an account to do it. In response, we opened MOP for all to provide those customers the convenience they see while removing perceived barriers to entry.\nWe believe these enhancements to the digital experience, coupled with more effortless ordering will continue to drive Starbucks towards membership over time with customers increasing frequency and spend. Once customers are in our digital ecosystem, they're more likely to remain engaged across channels and drive greater lifetime value.\nIn summary, our plans are beginning to work. We're recovering our brand from its perceptions. We're rebuilding the operational foundation of our stores and supply chain. We're reducing costs to support investments with sustaining partner experience improvements and we're working to make the Starbucks experience worth it every time. While it's early days, I'm confident in the trajectory of our U.S. business and the operational improvements we're making and I'm reassured by the impact our work is expected to deliver in FY 2025 and beyond.\nLooking outside the U.S., we continue to see weakness in parts of our international business and strength in others. Headwinds persist in the Middle East, Southeast Asia, parts of Europe, driven by widely discussed misperceptions about our brand. In some European markets, consumers are stretched. At the same time, we see significant strength in markets like Japan and parts of Latin America.\nChina is one of our most notable international challenges and an area I'd like to talk about in more detail. The competitive market dynamics in China are reflected in our recent results. We've continued to face a more cautious consumer spending and intensified competition. In the past year, unprecedented store expansion and a mass segment price war at the expense of comp and profitability have also caused significant disruptions to the operating environment. Still, we have made progress in important areas.\nThrough Q3, metrics like average daily transactions, weekly sales and operating margin improved sequentially quarter-over-quarter. Starbucks Rewards members grew by 1.6 million to a record-high 22 million active members. And customer connection scores reached a new high, while partner turnover reached a new low. We've built an amazing business in China over the past 25 years, a business for China built by an outstanding local team. We've pioneered the growth of the premium coffee industry in market with our Starbucks and Starbucks Reserve brands and brand equity remains distinctive.\nWe are incredibly committed and expert partners with an unmatched depth in coffee and craft. Our stores are distinctive and industry-leading, and our supply chain is world-class. New stores have expanded our presence to more than 900 county cities and continue to drive exceptional cash-on-cash returns and a payback of less than 2 years. We're looking beyond near-term challenges and towards long-term opportunities in the market.\nWe built Starbucks in China around 3 principles. A great customer experience is grounded in a great partner experience. Our coffee will always be distinctive and high quality, with low penetration relative to other markets, which provides continued headroom. Our beautiful stores will celebrate the culture and traditions of China and their local communities.\nEven in a challenging market, we have stayed true to these principles and our relative premium positioning. This is reflective in the competitive margins we have sustained in the face of price competition. Over the past 25 years, we've gone through different phases of growth in China and have relied on different strategic partnerships to grow our business and capabilities, like joint ventures and strategic partnerships in technology, real estate and supply chain.\nAs we look forward, we see higher growth and margin opportunities in China. We're building the next generation of Starbucks, grounded in our premium brands and with a business that is even more digital innovative and locally relevant. To do so, as our strategy evolves, we are in the early stages of exploring strategic partnerships to further enhance our competitive position to accelerate growth and innovate to win in the long term in China. We remain completely committed to our business and our partners in China, for the next 25 years and beyond. The long-term opportunity for us is significant.\nBefore I close, I would like to confirm that Elliott Management is a shareholder in our company, and our conversations to date have been constructive. On the business, my continued confidence is rooted in the focus, energy and effort of our partners across the business and around the globe. Our growing culture focused innovation and relentless execution continues to enhance our capabilities, operational muscle and executional discipline, driving forward our action plan and our long-term Triple Shot strategy while helping return the business to sustainable algorithmic growth.\nAnd with that, I'll turn this over to Rachel.\n\nRachel Ruggeri\n\nExecutive VP, CFO & Principal Accounting Officer\n\nThank you, Laxman, and good afternoon, everyone. As Laxman shared, we're seeing progress against our 3-part action plans. Additionally, our efficiency efforts, which are tracking ahead of expectations, partially offset investments associated with the cautious consumer environment. With continued focus on our action plans, efficiency efforts and disciplined operational execution, we expect progress as we close out the year. With that, let me turn to our results.\nOur Q3 consolidated revenue was $9.1 billion, up 1% from the prior year, demonstrating sequential revenue growth quarter-over-quarter, consistent with what we guided. Revenue growth over the prior year was driven by 8% net new company-operated store growth, partially offset by a 3% decline in comparable store sales from a 5% decrease in transactions and a 2% increase in average ticket as we continue to navigate through a value-driven consumer environment.\nU.S. led the average ticket increase of 4%, driven by pricing and multi-beverage orders. The increase in average ticket in the U.S. reflects how our innovative products and thoughtful promotions resonated with customers in our quest to offer enhanced value, indicating that our action plans are starting to take hold.\nShifting to transactions. U.S. posted a comparable transaction decline of 6%, primarily driven by non-SR members. Across SR customers, as Laxman shared, we saw improved frequency across all deciles. Mobile Order and Pay in the U.S. remained strong in the quarter with positive year-over-year total transaction growth of 7%, and -- as customers continue to value both the experience and convenience of the Mobile Order & Pay channel. As we open our app for all with MOP guest checkout, which launched earlier this month, we expect to create and deliver value across a broader population, expanding our universe of known customers to deepen engagement, driving increased frequency and spend.\nIn addition to strong SR program growth in the U.S., we saw strong SR program growth in China. SR members grew to a record 22 million 90-day active members in China, and in June, we also enhanced the program through extending rewards and introducing new diamond tier, which provides exclusive benefits to our most loyal SR members. We're pleased with the SR member growth across both the U.S. and China and expect to see the benefit from this growth in future quarters as new members provide a longer-term benefit.\nShifting to margin. Our Q3 consolidated operating margin contracted 70 basis points from the prior year to 16.7%, primarily driven by increased promotional activities, investments in store partner wages and benefits as well as deleverage. The contraction was partially offset by pricing and our continued execution against reinvention-related in-store operational efficiencies and -- as well as out-of-store efficiencies, which primarily center around our supply chain.\nAs you've heard Laxman discuss, we're focused on improving operational execution and efficiencies, and -- which is now more important than ever as we build resiliency in our business. Our efficiency efforts are built on creating sustainable improvements in our operations and end-to-end supply chain, allowing us to both reinvest in our business and drive margin expansion. A testament to these efforts includes the achievement in excess of 200 basis points in year-over-year efficiency gains as of Q3 and -- across both in-store and out-of-store areas, manifesting through our business and reduced store operating expenses and product and distribution costs, respectively. Collectively, these line items represent approximately 85% of our annual spend.\nOur in-store focus, a combination of efficiencies and staffing and scheduling as well as enhancements in our store equipment and new store format design, has fueled a reduction in partner turnover, creating greater stability in our stores. We believe that stability not only creates opportunity to nurture stronger connections with customers, but also increases productivity, which translated to roughly 110 basis point improvement in store operating expense in the quarter.\nOur efficiency focus also extends outside of the store, as we've been taking a hard look across our supply chain and other areas, including G&A. As Laxman shared, we're working collaboratively with suppliers to identify opportunities to leverage our scale for cost reductions without compromising product quality or distribution timeliness, which led to meaningful savings in the quarter of approximately 100 basis points between rebates and rate savings.\nIn addition, we believe our end-to-end supply chain focus gives us the opportunity to increase inventory availability with the right products at the right time, enhancing the customer experience while reducing waste. As we've shared g&A was elevated at more than 7% of revenue through Q2, we -- as we have deliberately invested in resources to continue to grow our technology capability.\nWe have, however, reduced G&A in Q3 and -- and expect it to remain closer to 6% of revenue in the second half of this fiscal year as we balance investments for our long-term growth. When considering our progress this fiscal year, our in-store and out-of-store year-to-date efficiency efforts collectively amounted to nearly 300 basis points of margin improvement.\nOur significant efficiency runway coupled with sales growth, gives us confidence to drive margin expansion over time. Given this, we have ample opportunities to deliver above our initial goal of $3 billion, driving to $4 billion in efficiencies over the next 4 years. Q3 EPS was $0.93, down 6% from the prior year. The decline was driven largely by the cautious consumer environment, which in response drove increased promotions and marketing in the quarter, partially offset by our efficiency efforts.",
        "content2": "Additionally, our higher effective tax rate had a $0.03 unfavorable impact driven by fewer discrete items relative to the prior year. With segment results being discussed in detail in today's Q3 earnings release, I'll now touch on our capital allocation and financial resilience and then move into guidance.\nAs a reminder, our disciplined approach to capital allocation continues to drive financial flexibility, allowing us to continue to make the necessary investments in our business to drive long-term growth. Our new stores continue to be a meaningful part of our growth equation with approximately 85% of our CapEx allocated to our stores, both new stores and renovations. These high-return growth-oriented investments have superior economics while adding incrementally to our business.\nEven with over 16,700 stores across the U.S. and another 7,300 in China, we have abundant white space ahead, particularly as populations continue to move to more suburban and rural areas.\nTake a Tier 3 market in U.S., for example. a place like Joplin, Missouri. A drive-thru in that market boasts a year 1 ROI in excess of 65%, with cash margins approaching 30% and a payback period of less than 2 years. Year 1 AUVs reach approximately 2 million with opportunity ahead as we build out the trade area. Importantly, our new store revenue is highly incremental, adding an average of nearly 90% to the trade area attained by our world-class store development partners and the rigorous work that leverages AI assisted strategic site selection process.\nWe see that in China as well. Take a New County City, for example. We're in only about 900 of the nearly 3,000 across the market. Today, we see year 1 ROI as high as 70% with cash margins averaging over 30% as we've successfully managed both store development and operating costs even in the current macroeconomic backdrop. We believe this is a great investment and accretive to shareholder value, building out the long-term opportunity.\nWith our disciplined approach to capital allocation, underpinned by our strengthening store portfolio, we are reinforcing our financial resilience, while remaining committed to our compelling dividend. We continue to target an earnings payout ratio of approximately 50%, near the top end of growth companies of our size and scale, resulting in a significant portion of our earnings going directly back to our shareholders.\nAnd currently, we have maintained a leverage target below 3x lease adjusted EBITDA, ensuring a strong financial foundation and consistent with our investment-grade credit rating of BBB+, which allows us to continue to access capital efficiently. Collectively, our disciplined approach enables us to preserve both balance sheet strength and flexibility, positioning us to successfully navigate through the current macroeconomic environment.\nMoving to our fiscal year 2024 guidance. We are encouraged with our progress this quarter, and we're pleased to reaffirm all metrics of our full year 2024 guidance. Our confidence is underpinned by the result of our action plans, coupled with the continued efficiency unlock both in and out of store.\nIn summary, here are key takeaways from my discussion today. First, we are seeing progress against our action plans. Second, our efficiency efforts partially offset investments associated with the cautious consumer environment. Third, we believe our financial fortitude and disciplined capital allocation strategy positions us well for the long term. And last, our full year 2024 guidance remains intact.\nBefore I close, I want to acknowledge all of our partners across the globe, working tirelessly each and every day to elevate the Starbucks experience in our stores, at our roasting plants and in our support centers, you are and always have been our superpower. Thank you, partners.\nAnd with that, we'll open the call for questions. Operator?"

Our performance this quarter was disappointing and did not meet our expectations. Our Q2 total company revenue was $8.6 billion, down 1% year-over-year. Our global comparable store sales declined 4% year-over-year, driven by a negative 3% comp growth in North America, led by declining traffic and a negative 11% comp growth in China. Our global operating margins contracted by 140 basis points to 12.8%, and our overall earnings per share declined by 7% to $0.68. While these results do not reflect our strengths, our capabilities or the opportunities ahead, we confront these challenges from a position of enduring strength. We have led the industry for more than 50 years because we have built a different kind of company, one that exceeds our partner expectations, one that delivers a distinctive and unique experience for our customers and one anchored in the love and craft of coffee.\nAs a result, our worldwide brand equity remains resilient and strong. Our leadership in coffee remains unmatched. Our global base of customers remains loyal. Our experiences are differentiated and elevated, our partners are talented and engaged. Our forward-looking product pipeline is highly appealing. Our distinctive store development capability continues to perform incredibly well. Our network of stores is healthy and robust. Our stores are executing better than ever with a stronger operating foundation. Overall, partner engagement is very strong. Our triple shop with 2 pumps reinvention strategy continues to deliver, and our possibilities as a company remain limitless, Still we face a challenging operating environment. Headwinds discussed last quarter have continued in a number of key markets, we continue to feel the impact of a more cautious consumer, particularly with our more occasional customer and a deteriorating economic outlook has weighed on customer traffic and impact felt broadly across the industry. In the U.S., severe weather impacted both our U.S. and total company comp by nearly 3% during the quarter. The remainder of our challenges were attributable to fewer visits from our more occasional customers.\nTurning elsewhere. We still see economic volatility in the Middle East, but we remain confident in the region's long-term growth opportunities. In China, we still see the effects of a slower-than-expected recovery, and we see fierce competition among value players in the market, but we are strengthening our premium position and our team in China continues to execute with terrific rigor and heart as the market shakeout continues and as demand recovers and matures.\nNone of these realities are excuses, some like weather are transitory. Others like a more cautious consumer may persist longer, but much is within our control. There are 3 execution opportunities in our U.S. business I want to expand on: First, meet the demand we have across dayparts to drive future growth; second, launch even more exciting and relevant new products while maintaining our focus on core coffee forward offerings; and third, reach and demonstrate more value for our occasional and non-Starbucks Rewards customers. We understand how to do this and we have what we need to deliver against our plans. So as we look to the second half of the fiscal year and beyond, we're accelerating our work on the underlying execution engines that power our business to realize these opportunities.\nLet me talk you through each: First, meet the demand we have in the U.S. across dayparts. The morning daypart is likely which you think off when you think of Starbucks. It is our peak, and it represents about half our business. It's coffee forward, heavily routine-based and driven by strong loyalty. At our [indiscernible], we bring in customers with distinctive coffee and a great experience. We convert them to Starbucks Rewards members. We build interest with new coffee innovations, and we encourage more frequent visits and food attached. But we currently have a challenge meeting our peak morning demand in the U.S. For example, more than 60% of our morning business in the U.S. comes from Starbucks Rewards members who overwhelmingly order with a Starbucks app. What's interesting though, despite strong Mobile Order & Pay sales, we saw a mid-teens percent order in completion rate within the order channel this past quarter. In other words, customers using MOP put items into their cart and sometimes chose not to complete their order, citing long wait times of product and availability, here lies opportunity.\nWe're intensely focused on actively working on improving operational throughput by providing our partners with the right processes and tools and on giving our customers a better sense of when the order will be ready. Rollout of our equipment-driven siren system is on track, but we're also fine-tuning the store processes that underpin this new equipment. We have been working for the past 6 months with the Toyota Production System Support Center to unlock additional capacity at our peak. And what we saw through store tests was a real near-term opportunity to fundamentally improve how we operate our stores. The siren craft system, as we're calling it, requires no capital.\nThe technology solutions are relatively straightforward. And we are working to roll it out in North American stores over the coming months. In stores where we've used the siren craft system to optimize operations, we have already seen an increase in peak throughput, which we estimate to be worth nearly 1 comp point annually. The siren craft system also bolsters the highly incremental returns we expect from our equipment-driven siren systems as it is deployed in stores.\nTaken together, these new processes and new equipment systems act as complements and amplify efforts to unlock capacity at peak. Additionally, we are revamping and investing in our Deep Blue technology to improve wait time estimates and provide more transparency for customers. Their efforts we began last quarter and build on the many improvements we've made to the Starbucks app over the last 12 weeks with introductions now on a 4-week upgrade cycle. Another reason customers choose not to complete their order is product availability. For example, our potato cheddar and chive bakes were a big hit with customers. But demand was so strong that we are currently only able to offer them in 2,000 of our U.S. stores. We are ramping up supply chain investments to further improve availability with an initial focus on our customers' favorite items.\nIn summary, we are working to increase throughput and improve product availability to enhance the customer experience, improve convenience and better capture existing demand. Over time, we believe these improvements will attract a larger subset of customers. I also want to talk about unmet overnight demand. We see it as a tremendous and untapped incremental opportunity. Last quarter, we mentioned we were conducting a pilot program to serve customers overnight between 05:00 p.m. and 05:00 a.m. when our stores are traditionally closed.\nDuring this pilot test, we doubled our business. Building off that success, we are aggressively pursuing options to build a $2 billion business over the next 5 years. Overnight opportunities are incremental and create a complement to our existing delivery business, which grew by double digits in the U.S. this quarter with both ticket increase and transaction growth. In addition to the overnight, we have unmet weekend demand potential. Starbucks attracts routine customers all week through the morning and the afternoon.\nWhile the weekend continues to attract our routine customers, we also see more families and kids. We are working to realize this demand potential to new product offerings, collaborations, marketing and enhancements to the store experience. As you can see, there is significant demand in the morning and even more potential during afternoon, overnight and the weekend, we have yet to realize. And we are accelerating our execution engines to meet it.\nSecond, launch more relevant and exciting new products for our U.S. customers while maintaining our focus on core coffee forward offerings. We are the leader in coffee, we are overwhelmingly focused on our coffee forward products. Coffee continues to perform strongly. And for example, 63% of our beverage sales in the quarter were cold, up 1% from a year ago driven by innovation. And beyond our core, there is more. We know we are challenged to bring new innovations with frequency and strong appeal across other dayparts. This winter, we brought back Pestachio Latte, rolled out Oleato nationally and launched a new core iced-shaken espresso. Our beverage is prepared with new breakfast products like our Potato Cheddar and Chive Bakes, some of our new products did well and drove positive customer buzz, but not all met our expectations.\nThat reality, coupled with what our customers have told us, points to opportunity across both coffee and non-coffee, and by that, I mean, refreshers, Matcha and Chive and across food to drive greater attach.\nLater in the quarter, we saw improvement. Our Lavender platform was extremely successful, including our Lavender Matcha, and it compares to some of the most successful launches we've ever had. But to cut through, we're working to drive even more buzz-worthy products and on strengthening the supply of products that become popular. These efforts take time, but our team is working with great energy and speed to make both happen. We also invested in our brand over the past quarter to address recent misinformation.\nThe work was effective in driving brand metrics and our overall brand equity and affinity remains strong. As we look ahead, we have an opportunity to better amplify our new products and to drive more awareness and excitement for those products, particularly among our more occasional customers. As we will detail, we are accelerating the execution engines to help us drive more frequent and exciting product innovations, both in the core and beyond.\nThird, reach and demonstrate more value for our occasional and non-Starbucks Rewards customers. We have loyal customers in the U.S., and they stay truly loyal in terms of frequency, transactions and the level of customization they sought with their purchases. We are a brand known for the premium value we provide. Our one-of-a-kind experiential Starbucks Reserve Roasteries, which elevate our brand and create lasting value had strong transactions, fueled by innovation across our coffee platforms, other beverages and food. Throughout the quarter, brand perception of value for what I get, on average, remained strong, and our pricing decisions have been measured.\nBut in this environment, many customers are being more exacting about where and how they choose to spend their money, particularly with similar savings mostly spent. We saw this materialize over the quarter as customers made the trade-offs, but being food away from home and food at home. Against that tide, we need to be able to reach and communicate with our customers in a way that demonstrates our value, particularly through Starbucks Rewards and the Starbucks app. We are accelerating back-end work on the Starbucks app to ensure we better connect with our more occasional customers.\nStarting in May, we will add new and exclusive in-app offers that create additional value for our customers. We'll also launch upgrades to the app that includes significant improvements to our wait time algorithms. Then in July, we will begin opening the Starbucks app for all while making MOP available in more places outside our app. Following the milestone, more of our customers will be able to see our offers, including those that use guest checkout and more customers will discover the strong value we provide, value that they will not see otherwise, more on that later.\nThese opportunities show that much is within our control. We are confident in our accelerated plans to strengthen the execution engines that power how we serve our customers, how we create and amplify a pipeline of new products and how we reach our customers through the Starbucks app. But let me be clear, it will take time to fully realize these opportunities. Our triple shop with two-pump strategy is the way we will drive these plans forward over the long term. So let's talk about our progress [indiscernible] strategic pillar. Our first strategic pillar is to elevate the brand. We do this by driving compelling product innovation, building great stores and operating great stores. Over all, we maintain our leadership and innovation in coffee. In fact, just last week, we announced several steps to reinforce our leadership position to the lens of our partners, our customers and our farmers.\nThese include new investments in coffee farms to further scale open agronomy practices, new and exclusive whole bean coffees coming to our core and reserve stores and new pop of experiences in cities around the world to engage Gen Z and millennial customers in the craft of coffee, which they love. Further, we are scaling the rollout of our Clover vertical brewer to deliver the world's finest top-quality browned coffee. The low vertical provides customers choice between 6 separate coffee roles and blends, including TCAP, brewed fresh on-demand any time of the day and its rollout is paired to the global launch of our new Starbucks Milano Duetto light and dark growth lens in stores later this year. As mentioned, we are also driving more frequent and exciting product innovation, both coffee and non-coffee.\nOur team has been working with remarkable speed and agility to create a product innovation pipeline that includes new flavors, textures and functional benefits. Investments in product development are already showing benefit. Our new lab and platform performed nearly as well this past quarter as the PSL. More recently, too, our new Spicy refreshers and reserve hot honey beverages show that relevant product innovation can exceed expectations. And our new Roastery and Reserve stores, we are now introducing new products with more agility and speed. Notably, we're also making strides to cut our average product development cycle in half from our current time table of 12 to 18 months.\nLooking to our innovation pipeline for the second half of the year, I'm excited by the number and types of products we're bringing to market. For summer, we are launching our first texture innovation pearls. This is the first of more text-based innovations that our customers can expect in the coming years. And we're launching a new functional product, a 0 to low-calorie handcrafted energy beverage, both build on our coffee heritage and open entirely new vectors for additional future innovation. And later this year, we will add up to 5 sugar-free customization options to our menu in response to both partner and customer requests.\nThis will provide a lower calorie option for approximately 80% of our beverages. Our product innovation pipeline will also include more plant-based options as well, like our new plant-based ready-to-drink Frappuccino beverage that recently launched in U.S. grocery stores. Beyond our beverage development pipeline, we're also focused on enhancements to food. As an example of the investment we're making in food quality, we recently launched a reimagined premium blueberry muffin. And for summer, we're launching a new egg pesto and Mozzarella sandwich. It combines protein with outstanding taste. We're also expanding grab-and-go choices available in our store lobbies to include more vegan, vegetarian and gluten-free options as well as kid-friendly options.\nTaken together, our partner experience, unique customer experience and our core products are what differentiates us. Our pipeline is significantly stronger than last year and product builds are being developed with partners and simplicity in mind. We're also investing in our supply chain to lower cost, and ensure products are available and in-store for our customers. Lastly, we continue to grow our global store footprint. Our store development capability is a core strength. This year, we will design and build more than 3,000 new stores globally, and we continue to do so in a financially accretive manner. Our new store openings continue to realize strong unit economics. AUVs and ROIs across our portfolio continue to drive strong returns and high incrementality. We're also leveraging learnings from international markets to meaningfully lower breakeven points for store formats scalable in emerging markets.\nMoving on. Our second strategic pillar is further strengthening and differentiating our leadership position in digital. As mentioned, Starbucks Rewards and the Starbucks app pay a central role in driving value for our customers. Our MOP set another record in the U.S., representing 31% of all transactions in the quarter. Our Starbucks Rewards members in the U.S. also grew by 6% over the prior year to nearly 33 million members.\nThe stickiness and evolution of our digital position provides a structural advantage. Building on this strength, we are mapping additional ways to engage customers as we work to double SR members over the next 5 years. As mentioned, we will begin opening the Starbucks app for all in July. This addresses the current gap in our ability to reach non-Starbucks Rewards members allows us to deliver more value for the occasional customers and improves our ability to convert them to SR members.\nIt drives a better experience for our customers and is core to our growth. We know that SR customers visit more often and spend more. Upgrades in our queue include a guest checkout feature and sequential improvements that make our app an even more appealing gateway for all customers. We also plan to invest $600 million over the next 3 years to further digitize our stores and better target customers in more personalized ways. This includes the installation of digital menu boards across the footprint of all our company stores in the U.S. and China. And we're making additional investments in our Deep Brew AI and machine learning platforms to further digitize and fine-tune how we operate our stores while delivering an improved digital customer experience and more personalized customer offers. Offers that are timely and relevant and flexible to location, inventory availability and weather. These investments, including a new revenue management system are foundational to successful execution.\nIn the near term, we continue to provide increasingly compelling offers like marketed pairings, including both beverage and food that make occasions like lunch even more appealing. We continue to encourage and reward routinized behaviors across the day with exclusive offers for SR members. To better communicate the value we provide, we are working to drive offer awareness with omnichannel marketing. This campaign will remind customers that the best offers are in the app and will target more occasional and non-SR customers. Our third strategic pillar is becoming truly global. Our international business remains an important part of our long-term growth strategy.\nAcross the Middle East, we continue to work with the Al-Shire group to support the well-being of our partners and customers. Last month, the Starbucks Foundation and Al-Shire Starbucks donated $3 million to the World Central Kitchen and their humanitarian efforts to provide food aid in Gaza. Last week, we also announced that every bag of whole bean Starbucks Odyssey Blend Coffee sold at participating North American stores through June will benefit World Central Kitchens efforts to address hunger around the world.\nTurning our attention to China. Macro pressures resulted in traffic contraction this quarter. Performance was impacted by a decline in occasional customers, changing holiday patterns, a high promotional environment and a normalization of customer behaviors following last year's market reopening. Like the U.S., our decline in occasional customers was most noticeable in the afternoons and evenings.\nStill, there are many bright spots. Starbucks remains the Chinese consumers' first choice and away from home coffee across city tier and age group. Our morning daypart in China registered growth fueled by coffee routines we've cultivated. Mornings are now larger than before the pandemic. Delivery also achieved positive comp. Starbucks Rewards membership expanded with active members now reaching a record $21 million.\nWe're investing further to grow our SR members and their loyalty to drive greater engagement and lifetime value. Beverage innovation is also strong and validates the opportunity we see to further drive the strength of our product pipeline in China. Through the quarter, we unveiled 27 new products fueling brand excitement and meaningful customer engagement and monthly customer connection scores are at their highest ever as its partner engagement.",
        "content2": "Our robust operating muscle led to sequential margin expansion amidst revenue headwinds, and we sustained very healthy and profitable unit economics and a double-digit store operating margin for a total store portfolio, including new stores. While recovery will remain choppy, our business has shown great resilience, and our fundamentals are very strong. We will win and lead in the premium market. We have built a strong and expanding customer base, a strong brand, a strong portfolio of highly profitable stores and strong capability to drive margin expansion. We continue to execute on the 3 key elements of our China strategy, offering more coffee forward, locally relevant product innovations, making significant investments in technology to increase omnichannel capability and digitize our stores and increase the percentage of new store openings in lower-tier markets and new county cities where we see stronger new store economics.\nWe will weather through this dynamic and transitory period as the industry shakeout continues. Our confidence in the market opportunity and our ability to deliver remains unwavering as we play the long game in China. Elsewhere, we saw growth in many parts of our international segment, highlighting the resilience and diversity of our business portfolio. Excluding China, our International segment grew revenue and comp in the quarter bolstered by strength in Latin America, Asia Pacific and Japan. The Latin American region continued its strong momentum with double-digit system sales growth.\nOur Asia Pacific region drove revenue growth despite headwinds in the Indonesian and Malaysian markets and revenue from our Japan business grew by double digits. Across our International segment, we opened 230 net new stores this quarter. In total, our store count outside of North America is now more than 20,800 reflecting a year-over-year growth of 9%. We opened our 400th store in India, our 600th store in Indonesia and a 1,900th store in Korea. We are on track to operate 1,000 stores in India by 2028, translating one new store opening every 3 days.\nAs we expand to Honduras and Ecuador, our global footprint will grow to more than 39,000 stores across 88 markets, putting us well on the path to 55,000 stores by 2030. Our fourth strategic pillar one of our 2 pumps is unlocking efficiencies. In the quarter, our triple shot strategy continued to unlock meaningful efficiencies across the North American business, driving 150 basis points of store operational efficiencies. Additionally, we saw meaningful reductions in product and distribution costs, driven by supply chain improvements in procurement, transportation and sourcing. Specifically in our U.S. stores, we're focused on creating a more stable environment for partners through investments in equipment innovation, process improvements, staffing, scheduling and waste reduction, all things our partners value and prioritize, creating a more satisfying work environment in our stores while derisking our business.\nToday, our stores are running better than ever before, underpinned by the strong fundamentals our team has built. For example, we see meaningful improvement in drive-thru window times without adding more work for our partners with even more to come as we layer in our siren craft system. We are rebuilding and refining our supply chain and to unlock efficiencies in our factory in the back we are leveraging technology in new ways. We have significant above the store opportunity to realize efficiencies in our supply chain. They are significantly higher than we initially thought and we are ahead of plan and savings. Through work to date, we have the confidence we need to extend our goal from $3 billion in added efficiencies over 3 years to $4 billion over the next 4. As a result of our investments and focused efficiency efforts, partner turnover reached a new low in the quarter. Store manager turnover has also improved, and both beat industry benchmarks by a wide margin. Average [indiscernible] partner continues to improve by double digits year-over-year, increasing engagement and their take-or-pay. That brings me to our fifth strategic pillar, reinvigorating our partner culture.\nFrom the beginning, Starbucks set itself apart as a different kind of company. Our unique culture is anchored in our mission promises and values of craft, results, courage, belonging and joy. And at the heart of our business are our partners. They are central to the Starbucks experience and are delivering on our promise to uplift the every day for customers around the world. I see this every day and through my regular work in stores. We continue to work to restitch the fabric of the Green Apron for our partners.\nJust last week, we gathered together to celebrate our first ever Starbucks Promises Day. And next month, we will celebrate the tenth anniversary of our Starbucks College Achievement Plan with Arizona State University. Following commencement, more than 13,000 partners will have earned the bachelor's degree through the program bringing to life our partner promise of a bridge to a better future. What's more, over 25,000 partners across more than 90% of our U.S. stores are currently enrolled in the program and are pursuing a bachelor's degree.\nTo close, we had a tough quarter. We need to do better, and we will. As I look forward, I'm confident we have the right strategy. We have terrific partners and a strong executive team that is deeply engaged and continues to lead. I thank each of our 460,000 green apron partners around the world for their remarkable work. We have real opportunity, and we are taking swift action to accelerate investment to the execution engines that will address the near term and drive our long-term success. These actions are funded by a highly profitable operations and productivity initiatives and is captured within our guidance. As these actions take hold, we expect our business to return to algorithmic growth and to achieve its long-term opportunity.\nAnd with that, I will turn it over to Rachel to discuss our results in greater detail. Rachel?\n\nRachel Ruggeri\n\nExecutive VP, CFO & Principal Accounting Officer\n\nThank you, Laxman, and good afternoon, everyone.\nAs Laxman shared, our performance this quarter did not reflect what we're capable of as a company. We have an incredible brand, loyal customers globally, a strong portfolio of highly profitable stores and in connection with our partners and customers that's unlike any other in our industry. We know that we can and we will do better. While it was a difficult quarter, we learned from our own underperformance and recognize the onus is on us to execute. We've sharpened our focus and with our comprehensive road map of well-thought-out of actions, the path forward is clear.\nWith that, let me turn to our results. Our Q2 consolidated revenue was $8.6 billion, down 1% from the prior year due primarily to a 4% decline in comparable store sales driven by lower transactions, partially offset by 8% net new company-operated store growth over the prior year. Q2 consolidated operating margin contracted 140 basis points from the prior year to 12.8%, primarily driven by deleverage, partner wages and benefit investments as well as promotional activities, partially offset by pricing and our continued execution against reinvention related in-store operational efficiencies, which drove approximately 150 basis point savings in the quarter. Q2 EPS was down -- was $0.68, down 7% from the prior year, primarily due to the contraction of operating income in both the North America and International segments as a result of lower revenue.\nI'll now provide segment highlights for Q2. North America revenue was $6.4 billion in Q2, flat to the prior year as 5% net new company-operated store growth was mostly offset by a 3% decline in comparable store sales driven by a 7% decrease in transactions partially offset by a 4% increase in average ticket. Our U.S. company-operated business posted a 3% comparable store sales decline in Q2, driven by a 7% decrease in transactions.\nConsistent with Q1, the traffic decline was pronounced among more occasional customers with a more cautious consumer environment as a backdrop, and also included an estimated 3% adverse impact from extreme weather, including some store closures. Partially offsetting the decline was a 4% increase in average ticket reflecting pricing as well as the continued mix shift into cold beverages such as ice-shaken espresso and Matcha Tea Latte, which resonate with our customers. Additionally, our new store performance remains strong, with both year 1 AUV and cash margin of recently opened stores projected to be in line with last year's newly opened stores, preserving high incrementality even with our expanding footprint. North America's operating margin was 18% in Q2, contracting 120 basis points from the prior year. The contraction was primarily driven by deleverage, partner wage and benefit investments as well as promotional activities, partially offset by pricing and reinvention related in-store operational efficiencies.\nWhile deleverage drove the overall contraction in the segment's margin, efficiencies generated through our reinvention efforts meaningfully countered the deleverage we experienced in the quarter. While our reinvention plan is intended to provide a more balanced growth model and margin expansion, we're pleased to see the benefits counterbalance, broader headwinds in our business as our partner staffing and scheduling investments continue to unlock in-store efficiencies. The benefits continue to expand outside of stores as well, resulting in meaningful reduction in the segment's product and distribution costs as a percentage of revenue, partially driven by supply chain savings. We believe our strategies related to reinvention are working, creating more streamlined operations and tangible financial benefits across our business with more opportunity to come.\nMoving to international. The segment delivered $1.8 billion in revenue in the quarter, roughly flat to the prior year, primarily as 12% growth in net new company-operated stores was offset by a 6% decline in comparable store sales driven evenly by transactions and average ticket. Revenue was also impacted by a decrease in licensed store revenues, largely resulting from the negative impacts to our business in the Middle East. Although our revenue was impacted, our long-term aspirations in international has not wavered as there was revenue and comp growth across the International segment when excluding China. This speaks to the strength of our broader international portfolio, driven by markets like Japan, Asia Pacific, Latin America and the Caribbean.\nShifting to China. In Q2, China's revenue declined 3%, driven by an 11% decrease in comparable store sales, consisting of 8% and 4% decline in average ticket and transactions, respectively, partially offset by a 14% net new store growth. The market continued to recover slower than expected, with further impacts from the timing of holiday related travel trends. Despite the complex environment, the market opened 118 net new stores in the quarter, while sustaining double-digit store operating margin for both new stores and the total portfolio, demonstrating the health and resilience of our brand in the market positioning us well in the market long term.\nTotal International segment operating margin was 13.3% in Q2, contracting 340 basis points from the prior year, primarily driven by promotional activities, partner wage and benefit investments as well as sales mix shift, partially offset by pricing in certain markets.\nShifting to channel development. The segment's revenue of $418 million in Q2 declined 13% from the prior year, largely in line with our expectations given the sale of Seattle's best coffee and SKU optimization. Importantly, we maintained the #1 share position in both U.S. at-home coffee and U.S. ready-to-drink. As an example of innovation in China, we launched our Starbucks Refreshers platform with 2 flavors, the pink drink and the purple drink, to drive our much-desired cool portfolio beyond our stores, particularly among Gen Z. The segment's operating margin was 51.7% in Q2, expanding 1,610 basis points from prior year, driven primarily by growth in our North America coffee partnership joint venture income as well as lapping prior year impairment charges against certain manufacturing assets. The segment's operating margin is progressing in line with our original expectations continuing to target the full year range of high 40% to low 50%, a very attractive financial model.\nNow moving on to our guidance for fiscal year 2024. Given what we shared today, we're revising our fiscal year guidance, and I'll walk through both: one, what changed; and two, what remains the same in comparison to our previous guidance.\nSo first, what changed? Broadly, in the second quarter, our business underperformed as revenues in the U.S., China, Middle East and other markets were impacted more deeply than anticipated by the continued multifaceted headwinds. In addition to the second quarter performance, our exit rates of both revenue and comp growth across our key markets reflect continued headwinds. To manage these headwinds, we have focused actions both to unlock capacity and track demand in the spirit of uplifting traffic as well as to further implement our triple shop strategy. Leveraging our learnings from the second quarter, and as Laxman discussed in detail, we're working to further elevate our brand through an integrated focus across product innovation and marketing, including strengthening our digital capabilities delivering more value for our customers.\nFor instance, first, to unlock demand in the morning day part in the U.S. We're working to improve store-related processes, leveraging our siren craft system while also increasing product availability through improved inventory management. Second, to attract demand, particularly in the afternoon daypart, we're implementing a new and more frequent innovation cadence integrated with a broader multi-crane marketing approach, inclusive of highly targeted personalized offers.\nThis shift is geared towards are more occasional customers to attract and inject them to our stores and apps. Now some of these actions will take time to fully materialize. However, through our investments in our customer experience and focused execution, we do expect to deliver some benefit in the current fiscal year. As a result of what has changed, our revenue and comp guidance as well as the related flow-through to margin and earnings is impacted. In addition, the continued headwinds impacted our global store growth expectations.\nNow before I share the details of our revised fiscal year 2024 guidance, I'll share what remains the same: first, we have confidence in the effectiveness of our proven triple shop strategy. as our biggest opportunity lies in our execution. Second, our efficiency efforts are tracking slightly ahead of our expectations. Year-to-date, we achieved 170 basis points of in-store operational efficiencies along with great progress out of store, positioning us to deliver our $3 billion savings target through fiscal year 2026 with line of sight to even more opportunity beyond that.\nThird, while our Channel Development segment is the smallest of our segments, it complements our portfolio, capturing customer occasions beyond our stores and our performance in that segment continues to deliver. Lastly, we must continue investing in the fundamentals and competitive moat of our business, our partners, our stores and our customers as we believe these investments will drive long-term growth and industry leadership beyond these transitory headwinds.\nBased on these facts, we are revising our full year fiscal 2024 guidance; two, global revenue growth of low single digits from our previous range of 7% to 10%. Global and U.S. comps of low single-digit decline to flat both from the previous range of 4% to 6% growth, China comp of single-digit decline from the previous expectation of low single-digit growth in Q2 through Q4. Global net new store growth of approximately 6% from our previous expectation of approximately 7%. We continue to expect our U.S. store count to grow by approximately 4% and now anticipate approximately 12% store growth in China from our previous expectation of approximately 13%. Operating margin growth approximately flat from the previous expectation of progressive expansion.\nFinally, we expect EPS and non-GAAP EPS growth of flat to low single digits from the previous range of 15% to 20%. As a reminder, our guidance does not include any impact from foreign currency translation and assumes constant currency. As an additional insight into our fiscal year 2024 guidance, we expect sequential revenue growth from Q3 to Q4 with pressure on margin and earnings easing in Q4 as our action plans take hold. We continue to expect our full year effective tax rate in the mid-20% range.\nLastly, we continue to expect approximately $3 billion in CapEx, most of which is [indiscernible] expense for our direct investment in our global store portfolio, which as we have shared, continues to drive highly attractive returns.\nIn summary, here are key takeaways for my discussion today. First, Q2 was a challenging quarter for us as headwinds consistently persisted throughout the quarter leading us to revamp our actions and response plans to both unlock and attract demand. Second, our triple shot strategy continues to deliver efficiencies even in the face of headwinds reinforcing that we have the right strategy at the right time. Next, our fiscal year 2024 guidance has been revised to reflect our Q2 performance, year-to-date results as well as the near-term headwinds we're experiencing. We, however, remain confident in our long-term growth opportunity and thus, committed to our strategy and the related investments. And finally, our disciplined approach to capital allocation drives our financial fortitude reflecting shareholder commitment underpinned by our best-in-class dividend. This allows us to preserve both balance sheet durability and flexibility, positioning us to successfully navigate this complex and dynamic environment.\nBefore I open the call to Q&A, I want to share my sincerest gratitude for my partners, both in and out of stores across the globe who show up every day, living our values to deliver the differentiated customer experience that makes Starbucks so special for all of us. Thank you, partners. Operator, you can now open the call to Q&A."

I will start by sharing an overview of our business performance in our first quarter of fiscal 2024. I will then turn it over to Rachel Ruggeri to walk through the detailed segment results.\nWe saw strong momentum in a highly successful holiday in the quarter with record revenue and expanded margins. We saw strong growth in our loyalty programs, sequentially increased in frequency and record spend among our loyal customers, positive traction from new product innovations, exciting momentum in China with our focus on premium and progress on the execution of our Triple Shot strategy. We also saw some unexpected headwinds, which impacted the rate of growth. We feel very confident about our robust plans to address these challenges. While we are already seeing traction, there was an impact in the quarter, and it will take some time to normalize.\nLet me walk you through the details. Our performance in the quarter was fundamentally strong. Our Q1 total company revenue was a record $9.4 billion, up 8% year-over-year. Our global comparable store sales grew 5% year-over-year, supported by a 5% comp growth in North America, driven by 4% ticket growth and 10% comp growth in China. Our global operating margins expanded by 130 basis points to 15.8% and our overall earnings per share grew 20% to $0.90. This speaks to the continued successful execution of our reinvention plan and the durable business we are building.\nWe are fortunate to have built 1 of the strongest brands in the world, and we continue to benefit from customer loyalty. Throughout the quarter, we saw our most loyal customers around the world coming into our stores more often. Specifically, in the U.S., we set new records with our 90-day active Rewards members growing 13% year-over-year to a record 34.3 million, with tender reaching an all-time high of 59% demonstrating increased engagement. Importantly, the frequency of our most loyal customers increased sequentially and spend per member reached a record in Q1 fueled by our holiday promotion, which significantly exceeded our expectations.\nOur cold and Gingerbread platforms drove a record high ticket in the U.S. in the quarter. We also had the highest sales of Starbucks Gift Cards in our history, making us #2 in gift cards sold. In total, we have an incredible $3.6 billion preloaded onto our cards in the U.S. in the quarter. In short, our growing Starbucks Rewards members are visiting our stores more frequently and increasing their spend each time that they come.\nWe also saw great momentum in China. We aim to be the best in the premium market in China. Our brand equity across Starbucks and Starbucks Reserve is second to none. Based on our latest brand tracker, Starbucks continues to be the first choice in away-from-home coffee, including among the Gen Z consumers. We continue to lead in brand affinity and have the highest awareness, brand familiarity and purchase intent scores. We have the most outstanding partners in our stores with very strong customer connection and the highest retention rates in our industry. We offer distinctive global and locally relevant product innovation anchored on superior coffee with food attachments and a morning daypart that now have surpassed pre-COVID levels.\nOur loyal customers, a major part of tender, are coming more often and our loyalty program is growing. We're doing all of this while offering premium physical and digital experiences delivered across our distinctive store portfolio across other physical channels and through our digital connection and doing so at a commensurate value. This ambition of being best in premium in China is in line with our long-term growth ambitions for China.\nLet me now talk about the headwinds and our response. We entered the first quarter very strong globally. We had great momentum in August and September, and that continued into October, which exceeded our expectations across every measure. Beginning in mid-November, while our business continued to grow, the growth rate was impacted by 3 unexpected factors.\nFirst, we saw a negative impact to our business in the Middle East. Second, events in the Middle East also had an impact in the U.S., driven by misperceptions about our position. Our most loyal customers remain loyal and in fact, increased their frequency and spend in the quarter. But we did see a softening of U.S. traffic. Specifically, our occasional U.S. customers, who tend to visit the afternoon, came in less frequently. I will speak in a moment as to how we quickly responded with an effective action plan. Finally, we experienced a slower-than-expected recovery in China, driven by a more cautious consumer. While we had a relatively very strong Double 11 holiday, the overall market weakness led to significantly increased pricing competition.\nWe responded quickly to these headwinds. In the U.S., we implemented targeted offers aimed at bringing our occasional customers into our loyalty program. As we've seen over time, Starbucks Rewards members develop a routinized long-term relationship with our brand that increases both ticket and transactions. Additionally, we activated new capabilities within our proprietary Deep Brew data analytics and AI tool to identify and incentivize specific rewards members cohorts. Finally, we are leaning further into our brand, marketing and factual narrative and social media to engage these audiences where they are.\nWe've already seen the positive impact of these new initiatives with our more occasional customers beginning to rebound in December. However, we continue to see further opportunity to welcome back our very occasional customers. We feel good about the trajectory over the course of the quarter, but it will take time for our plans to be fully realized.\nIn China, we remain very confident in the long term. The market is going through a transition as we see an increase in mass market competitors, which we believe will shake out over time, and the market will emerge looking fundamentally different than what we see today. We expect a much larger and tiered market as per capita consumption continues to increase and the market matures. There are 3 key elements in our China strategy.\nFirst, we are offering more coffee forward, locally relevant product innovations and we're increasing engagement in social media channels to influencers and partnerships, which are highly effective in China. These actions are increasing awareness and have led to greater customer frequency. Second, we have made significant investments in technology, increasing our omnichannel capability, allowing us to serve more customers through new occasions. These investments have also led to a more digitized store environment, increasing efficiency of our supply chain and stores while enhancing the partner experience and strengthening our unit economics in both existing and new stores.\nFinally, we're increasing the percentage of new stores opening in lower tier markets and new county cities where we see meaningfully stronger new store economics. As you can see, we moved quickly to respond and implement a plan to address these unexpected headwinds. It will take time for these action plans to be fully realized. That said, we remain confident in our Triple Shot strategy and our long-term growth. So let me share some of the progress in the quarter.\nOur first Triple Shot Reinvention priority is to elevate our brand by operating great stores and driving product innovation. The best lever for elevating our brand is our store experience. We continue to raise the bar on running great stores with a focus on enhancing both our partner and customer experience. One example is the continued rollout of our Siren System cold and food stations. We remain on track to have approximately 10% of our stores equipped with a Siren System by the end of this year. We are a coffee company, and we will continue to lead with coffee innovation. We're continuing the installation of our Clover Vertica in nearly 10% of our U.S. company-operated stores in the quarter.\nWe are on track to have on-demand single-cup brewers installed in nearly 60% of our U.S. company-operated stores in fiscal year 2024. This will continue to elevate our coffee offering while also making partners more productive by reducing waste and creating efficiencies in store, allowing them to spend more time doing what they do best, connecting with our customers. Just imagine a perfectly brewed on-demand cup of coffee at any time throughout the day, even decaf. This quality and the offering are like no other in the industry.\nWe also continue to offer coffee blends, which are distinctive and remind people of the romance of coffee. Our Verona blend is anchored in the essence of Verona, Italy. It was our tribute to the city of romance in Italy. In celebration of our 5 years in Italy, we will introduce a new coffee, Starbucks Milano Roast inspired by the art and culture of Milan. Milan's Me Art, an international modern and contemporary art fair, is the perfect backdrop to a launch in our Milan Roastery that will then scale globally. The moment will capture a love of coffee, the passion of our partners and the dynamism of Milano.\nToday, we are excited to launch the Oliarto platform with Oliarto customizations across the U.S. In the coming weeks, we will also launch a chocolate-covered strawberry Crem Frappuccino and a chocolate hazelnut cookie, cold brew in time for Valentine's Day. Starting this week, and continuing over the next few months, we will be introducing 3 new beverage platforms, each of which is squarely aimed at our Gen Z and millennial customers across the range of coffee and core beverages and compelling for the afternoon. These product innovations are examples of how we continuously elevate the brand and welcome customers back with a unique Starbucks experience.\nWe're also offering new and exciting options beyond coffee, including food that appeals to different dayparts, especially the afternoon. In January, we added new menu items, including the potato Cheddar and chive bakes and the Chicken Maple butter and egg sandwich. These are products that tide our customers over between lunch and dinner. Importantly, our digital experience makes attaching food to afternoon drink orders easy and convenient. We've seen a very positive customer response to these new items, and we are expanding inventory to meet the strong demand.\nWe're also pleased with the pace of our new store openings and strong unit economics. Our most recent age of class of company-operated new stores in the U.S. is average unit volumes of approximately $2 million with ROIs of approximately 50%. And as we continue to open more stores, growing by approximately 4% this year in the U.S. on a base of over 16,000, including licensed stores, we will further invest in purpose-built stores to meet our customers where they need and want us to be. This includes drive-throughs, which have grown by over 500 stores since Q1 of last year.\nEven in the U.S., we see abundant greenfield opportunity ahead. Our second strategic priority is further strengthening and differentiating our leadership position in digital. We saw our mobile order and pay surpass a record high 30% of all transactions in the quarter, and we reduced downtime of mobile order and pay by half as we continue to find ways to deliver better customer experience. We'll continue to make the Starbucks app even better, including adding the ability to use a personal cup in ordering through the app and the rollout of more accurate order wait times. We're also laser-focused on ensuring our customers can personalize their orders in whatever way they want. One example is helping customers find products based on dietary needs.\nWe saw record results in our U.S. delivery business with growth of nearly 80% year-over-year, aided by our expanded partnership with DoorDash. We see significant growth for continued incremental growth as delivery represents only 2% of our transactions. Our purpose-built stores optimized for delivery and fulfillment help seize this opportunity. Additionally, we are conducting a pilot with GoPast targeting a fully incremental opportunity for overnight orders between 5 p.m. and 5 a.m. In this pilot, Starbucks trained Barista's proper handcrafted Starbucks drinks and food inside GoPos micro fulfillment centers, delivering to the customer's door in about 30 minutes.\nTo further expand the reach and impact of mobile ordering and rewards, we now offer Starbucks connecting over 40% of our more than 6,700 U.S. licensed stores, with further expansion planned for this year. We're also pleased to share that Bank of America will be our next Starbucks Rewards partner, delivering even more value to our most loyal customers. This opportunity builds the great success of our partnership with Delta Airlines that has deepened connection and engagement with our members and is one of 2 new Starbucks Awards partnerships we told you we would roll out this year.\nOur third strategic priority is becoming truly global. Our international business represents an important growth opportunity for us over the long term. If you look at our business, excluding the headwinds, we had a strong quarter, demonstrating the momentum and resiliency across the portfolio. We opened over 420 net new stores in the quarter, a growth of 10% year-over-year, bringing total store count to over 20,600 stores with nearly 14,000 of those stores outside of China and the U.S. In Japan, we reached a milestone of 1,900 stores across the market with much opportunity ahead.\nLet me address our business in the Middle East. I am deeply distressed by the violence shaking the region. As I have shared, Starbucks condemns violence against the innocent, hate and weaponized speech. We are intensely focused on supporting our partners and the many other stakeholders affected by what is taking place. We have seen a significant impact on traffic and sales in the region and we are working with our licensees during this time to ensure the safety and well-being of our partners and our customers.\nI shared earlier in my remarks how we are addressing the near-term situation in China. Overall, our business and brand in China remains strong. Our revenue in the quarter grew 20% in constant currency underpinned by a 10% increase in comparable store sales growth as the market lapped prior year mobility restructurings. As we strengthen our position in the premium market in China, let me point to a few accomplishments of the quarter. We launched 12 new coffee forward beverages in the quarter, including Intenso, which was incredibly popular with our customers, including Gen Z, fueling the morning daypart, which is now larger than pre-COVID levels.\nOur digital channels accounted for a record 52% of sales, up 4 percentage points quarter-over-quarter. Our Starbucks Rewards gold member frequency increased by nearly 10% over the prior quarter, with total member engagement setting a record 73% of tender, demonstrating the stability of our most loyal customers. Our new stores continue to deliver attractive returns on both the top line and profitability with further strengthened unit economics in stores opened in new county cities. And our turnover amongst full-time store partners reached a record low in the quarter, coupled with an all-time high partner satisfaction score.\nEarly this month, we celebrated our 25th anniversary in China. With nearly 7,000 stores, we have built a durable business. We have built a terrific brand, and we are well on track to hit our 9,000 store target by 2025 and continue to have full confidence in the market opportunity. We continue to see enormous potential in China's premium market, and no one is better positioned to lead in this space.\nEven as we navigate a dynamic environment, we remain confident in our long-term growth in our International segment. As part of elevating our brand across the International segment, along with a second Reserve store in India, we will open 2 additional Starbucks Roasteries that celebrate coffee, art and design in markets outside the U.S. and China. We will announce these locations and opening timings in due course.\nTurning to our fourth priority. We're focused on unlocking $3 billion in efficiencies, and I'm pleased to say that we're making steady progress. Our Triple Shot Reinvention efforts delivered 130 basis points of margin expansion in the first quarter of the fiscal year. As you heard me say often, the key to our success is the experience that our partners create for our customers. We're investing in a better experience for our partners to advance our business to a more balanced growth model as we unlock efficiency. In the quarter, we have seen the effectiveness of the Reinvention driven investments we have made in in-store operational efficiencies such as standards, equipment innovation and scheduling improvements, leading to a more stable environment for our partners.\nTurnover has decreased by 5% year-over-year and is now well below pre-COVID levels. Average partner hours increased 10% leading to a 14 percentage point increase in partner sentiment related to scheduling, specifically preferred hours, which we know is important to partners. We are listening to our partners and investing to make their experience better. Of course, we have more work to do, but we are proud of the progress we have made today. Outside of our stores, we're working to drive efficiencies across our supply chain and expenses. I am pleased with the progress, and we remain on track to unlock $3 billion dollars of efficiencies over the next 3 years.\nOur final priority is reinvigorating our partner culture. In addition to the investments in partner experience, we're focused on partner culture. Our leadership team and Board of Directors have been deeply engaged in putting the partner experience at the heart of the business. An independent assessment found that our strategic investments, greater on-the-ground support, a dedicated labor relations team and more bespoke management trading are having a tangible impact on the commitments we have made to our partners. The assessment was also clear that there has been no Union busting playbook at Starbucks.\nI want to be clear in my view on the matter of unionization at Starbucks. We believe in a direct relationship with our partners. Adding the 4% of our stores in the U.S. where our partners have chosen to be represented by a union, we are committed to finding a constructive path forward with those unions. I care deeply about our partners, their experiences and safety at Starbucks and their futures. Our partners remain core to the success of our business, and I am proud to be restitching the fabric of the green apron for all partners. Going forward, we plan to continue to focus deeply on reintegrating our partner culture. It's a priority for me, and I'll continue spending time each month working up close shoulder to shoulder with partners in stores.\nI did this during my visit to India earlier this month, and I will continue doing it to stay grounded in the realities of the business, good and not so good. I'm also proud to have earned my Coffee Master Black Apron along with my executive leadership team. A deep connection to partners and to coffee is a top priority for me and for every leader at Starbucks.\nAs we look ahead to what is brewing for Starbucks in 2024, I had great optimism. We have a strong strategy, our refreshed mission, values and promises are underpinning everything we do. We have many strengths to build on and a clear plan to navigate this dynamic environment. While it will take time, we are confident we have significant headroom to further grow top line and bottom line in the long term and invest in our partners and the business by delivering strong shareholder returns.\nFinally, before I turn this over to Rachel, I want to remind everyone that Starbucks is focused on human connection. We stand for belonging. We stand for joy. We stand for humanity. That is what differentiates our brand and our business and has for the last 52 years. We believe this has never been more important in the world. And with that, Rachel?\n\nRachel Ruggeri\n\nExecutive VP, CFO & Principal Accounting Officer\n\nThank you, Laxman, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me start by saying that I am so proud of the significant margin expansion and double-digit earnings growth we delivered in our first quarter despite the top line headwinds we experienced. Our strong focus on reinvention continued to unlock efficiencies driving a balanced outcome where both revenue growth and margin expansion drove our earnings growth. As we have shared, we are unlocking multiple paths to support our earnings growth over the long term, creating a more durable business and this quarter proves testament to that durability.\nOur Q1 consolidated revenue reached a record $9.4 billion, up over 8% from the prior year even with the confluence of factors adversely impacting our business as Laxman discussed in detail at the top of our call. The revenue increase was driven by 5% comparable store sales growth, 8% net new company-operated store growth as well as a 6% increase in our global licensed store revenue over the prior year, underscoring the strength of our broader portfolio and our execution.\nQ1 consolidated operating margin expanded 130 basis points from the prior year to 15.8%, primarily driven by sales leverage and Reinvention related in-store operational efficiencies, partially offset by our continued investments in our partners. Our Reinvention has successfully driven resiliency in our business with our North America margin expanding a notable 280 basis points in the quarter, which I will discuss in further detail in a moment.",
        "content2": "Q1 EPS was $0.90, up 20% from the prior year. Our strong double-digit EPS growth in the quarter demonstrates multiple paths to drive growth and profitability. I'll now provide segment highlights for Q1.\nNorth America delivered another quarter of record revenue in Q1 was $7.1 billion, up 9% from the prior year, driven by a combination of a 5% increase in comparable store sales inclusive of a 4% and 1% increase in average ticket and transactions, respectively, as well as net new company operated growth of 4% over the prior year. Our U.S. licensed store business also contributed to the segment's growth from increased travel and further rollout of our Starbucks Connect program.\nOur U.S. company-operated business delivered 5% comparable store sales growth in Q1 driven by 4% ticket growing from pricing, mix and customization. This led us to having our highest average ticket in our 50-plus-year history as our successful holiday innovation and complementary product offerings, including our new Chai Tea Latte and Sugar Plum Cheese Danish resonated with customers. Comparable transactions for the quarter increased 1% as traffic was pressured to negative single digits in November before it started to rebound in December.\nIn light of the pressured traffic, and as Laxman mentioned earlier, customers showed strong loyalty through our Starbucks Rewards program with record engagement and the highest ever spend per member. North America's operating margin was 21.4% in Q1, expanding 280 basis points from the prior year, driven by 240 basis points from Reinvention related in-store operational efficiencies as well as sales leverage and pricing, partially offset by continued investment in our partners. This substantial margin expansion in the quarter reflected the meaningful labor staffing and scheduling improvements we made as part of our reinvention. We unlocked significant stability by focusing on staffing and scheduling hours based on partners' preferred shifts, which enhanced both our partners' experience and subsequent store performance.\nWe saw store efficiency increase as items per labor hour reached its highest level in the quarter. Outside of stores, we reaped the benefits of enhancing -- enhanced sourcing and waste reductions in the first quarter, as seen by improvement in the segment's product and distribution costs. When you think about the operational efficiencies that continue to manifest both in and out of stores, we expect to continue delivering progressive margin expansion.\nMoving to International. The segment delivered $1.8 billion in revenue in the quarter, up 12% from the prior year. The revenue growth was driven by a 12% increase in net new company-operated stores year-over-year as well as a 7% increase in comparable store sales driven by 11% transaction growth, partially offset by a 3% decline in average ticket. As Laxman mentioned, the pace of recovery in China was slower than expected. That, coupled with a negative impact to our business in the Middle East, pressured our international segment as a whole. However, we continue to see these headwinds as transitory and remain committed to our long-term growth ambitions in the segment.\nIn Q1, China's revenue grew 20% driven by 15% new store growth as well as a 10% increase in comparable store sales growth, including 21% transaction growth, largely related to the market lapping prior year COVID impact. Comparable ticket, however, declined 9% due to mix shift, including lower sales of merchandise and increased promotional environment. The market opened 169 net new stores and entered 28 new county cities in the quarter, serving as a proof point that our commitment to expanding our premium position in the market has not wavered.\nTotal International segment operating margin was 13.1% in Q1, contracting 110 basis points from the prior year. The contraction was primarily driven by investments in partner wages and benefits, business mix shift as a greater portion of the segment's revenue was generated in our company-operated markets versus the prior year and strategic investments, partially offset by sales leverage.\nShifting to channel development. The segment's revenue of $448 million in Q1 declined 7% from the prior year, largely in line with our expectations given the sale of Seattle's Best Coffee. Our business continues to resonate with customers as Starbucks maintained the #1 share position in both U.S. at-home coffee and U.S. ready-to-drink in the first quarter as our holiday offerings such as Peppermint Mocha and Gingerbread were among customer favorites. The segment's operating margin was 46.8% in Q1, down 60 basis points from prior year, driven by product cost and Global Coffee Alliance, partially offset by business mix shift. Although there was contraction in the first quarter, we continue to expect the segment's full year operating margin to expand to the high 40% to low 50% range and be accretive to our total company margin.\nNow moving on to our guidance for fiscal year 2024. We are confident that the business pressures we experienced in the first quarter are transitory. With that, our guidance shared at our Reinvention update in November remains unchanged related to our global store growth, operating margin and EPS. However, given the collective magnitude of headwinds on our first quarter revenue and the time it will take for our action plans to be realized, we are revising our full year outlook for revenue and comp to reflect our Q1 results, as well as account for recent trends, including a softer-than-planned January, which we expect will impact our Q2 performance.\nWith that, we now expect our full year global revenue growth in the range of 7% to 10%, revised from our previous range of the low end of 10% to 12%. Full year global and U.S. comp growth in the range of 4% to 6%, both revised from the previous range of 5% to 7%. China comp growth of low single digits for the balance of the year, revised from the previous range of 4% to 6% in Q2 through Q4 with higher comp in Q1. Just to be clear, we continue to expect to deliver full year global store growth at approximately 7%, progressive operating margin expansion on a full year basis, full year EPS and non-GAAP EPS growth in the range of 15% to 20% as we have multiple paths to such earnings growth as we demonstrated in the first quarter.\nAs an additional insight, here are a few clarification items related to guidance. As a reminder, our guidance does not include any impact from foreign currency translation and assumes constant currency. In terms of quarterly shape, we expect growth rates for our global revenue comp, operating margin as well as GAAP and non-GAAP EPS to be the lowest in Q2 and meaningfully below our full fiscal year guidance ranges due to the pressures we discussed in today's call. These metrics are then expected to rebound and stabilize in the second half of our fiscal year.\nWhile we continue to expect our effective GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates in the mid-20% range, they are expected to be meaningfully higher than our fiscal year 2023 tax rate of 23.6%, which benefited from certain discrete nonrecurring tax items.\nFinally, our disciplined capital allocation approach continues to deliver significant results. The combination of revenue growth, margin expansion and improved working capital, underpinned by the disciplined capital allocation, increased our Q1 cash from operations to a record $2.4 billion. Our strong cash generation, together with our leverage and investment grade rating, creates exceptional shareholder returns while maintaining balance sheet flexibility to fund our critical investments, creating a competitive advantage.\nIn summary, here are key takeaways from my discussion today. First, our Triple Shot Reinvention is continuing to unlock our greatest potential, evidenced by the strong operating margin performance and balanced earnings growth in the first quarter in spite of the pressured environment. Next, our revenue and comp guidance has been revised to reflect our Q1 results and expected near-term and transitory headwinds. But importantly, despite these headwinds, we remain committed to our full year fiscal 2024 EPS growth in the range of 15% to 20%. Further, we have robust plans to navigate through the complex and dynamic environment and recognize our plans will take time to materialize, but remain confident in our long-term growth. And finally, our focused and disciplined approach to capital allocation drives our financial fortitude and balance sheet optionality, keeping us in a position of strength.\nBefore I close, I want to thank all the partners across the globe who consistently find ways to create joy and foster connection to and with our customers. You give me the confidence that our best days are yet to come. So thank you, partners.\nWith that, I'll turn it back to Tiffany.\n\nTiffany Willis\n\nVice President of Head of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Rachel. Before we open the call to Q&A, we request that your questions today be focused on the quarterly performance that we just discussed, as this call is not to address questions related to recent proxy filings.\nWith that, Diego, let's take the first question."

Welcome to Starbucks' Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Thank you in advance to those who will join us this afternoon where we will share an update on our long-term strategies and celebrate the launch of holiday at Starbucks.\nBefore we get started this morning, I'd like to express my deepest gratitude to our Starbucks partners around the world for a very successful fiscal year 2023. I've learned through connecting with so many of you how our reinvention plan has continued to be well executed, giving us great momentum in this age of our transformation at Starbucks. I have discovered how our brand is uniquely delivered in our stores and digitally through our extraordinary partners and the tremendous headroom we see for our global business.\nTurning now to our business performance. Rachel and I will share details of our strong results delivered in the quarter and fiscal year 2023, and we will also share our confidence in the company's long-term opportunity with guidance for fiscal year 2024. What you will take away from this call today is that we have great momentum, fueled largely by our reinvention plan. We are seeing the work pay off through improved partner and customer experiences, as well as captured improvements in efficiency and margin. We believe this bodes well for this next year and for years beyond.\nTo deliver our long-term sustainable growth, we are focused on 5 areas. You will hear more on what we call our triple shot reinvention and our continued momentum this afternoon. The discussion will provide a more detailed outlook on our 3 core and 2 enabling priority areas. First, we will elevate the brand through our stores. Second, we will strengthen and scale in digital. Third, we will become truly global. Fourth, we will unlock efficiencies, including outside stock. Finally, we will reinvigorate the partner culture at Starbucks.\nIn the fourth quarter, our total company revenue reached a record $9.4 billion, representing an 11% increase year-over-year. Full year revenue reached a record of $36 billion, representing 12% growth year-over-year for fiscal 2023, or 14% when excluding the 2% impact of foreign currency translation, aligning our revenue growth at the high end of our guidance range. Equally impressive, our global comparable store sales increased 8% year-over-year, both for the quarter and the fiscal year 2023, driven by a healthy mix of ticket and transaction growth.\nWe grew earnings per share by 31% to $1.06 for the quarter and by $0.20 to $3.54 for the fiscal year, again, aligning to the top end of our guidance range. Importantly, we grew margin by 310 basis points for the fourth quarter and 100 basis points on a full year basis. And we did all this while growing our global store count to over 38,000, in line with our store growth guidance of 7% in fiscal year 2023.\nDemand for stocks remains Starbucks around the world. Here in the U.S., our largest market, we saw momentum sustain throughout the quarter. Revenue for the quarter was up a record 12%, underpinned by 8% comps. We had a remarkable fall launch that led to record-breaking average weekly sales. Our 90-day active Starbucks Rewards members reached a new record this quarter of nearly 33 million 90-day active members, and setting records in spend per member and total member spend.\nCustomers remain loyal to their favorite 4 menu classics that have stood the test of time, including the Pumpkin Spice Latte, which celebrated its 20th anniversary. In addition to very strong performance in our core offerings, we also have strong performance with new offerings, including our Apple-inspired beverages and food items.\nThe results from the quarter, including the dynamic way we are driving ticket growth, give us great confidence in our menu innovation on both an individual product overall portfolio level. We have proven that complementary yet competing products and flavors can successfully coexist, such as pumpkin and Apple, with the right menu innovation, marketing mix and strategic pricing strategies.\nAs customer demands have evolved, we've delivered more beverages, food and personalization and customization across existing and new formats to meet their expectations and grow the business. Our continued investments in our partners, equipment, supply chain and technology are paying off, evidenced by a margin expansion across North America to 23.2% this past quarter.\nTimed with our busiest cold foam promotion of the year, the recent rollout of our new portable cold foamers to all U.S. company-operated stores, enhanced productivity in the fourth quarter. and lessened the trade on our partners, while continuing to meet the high cold beverage demand. In support of the continued growth in cold beverages, we delivered over 550 new Nugget ice machines and remained on track with installation prioritized for our most ice-constrained stores in fiscal year 2024.\nClover Vertica, our on-demand single-cup brewer, is now installed in over 600 of our stores across the U.S., and we continue the on-schedule rollout of the Siren System cold and food stations, prioritizing new stores and renovation locations. Our portfolio and pipeline management of new equipment design and rollout plans are robust and enabled us to deliver our results.\nWe have created a more stable environment in our stores. Hours per partner increased in the quarter by 5% as we continue filing schedules that fit our partners and customers' needs. Total was down in the fourth quarter by 10%, while barista tenure increased by 16% for the quarter. Customer connection scores also improved in the quarter relative to this time last year. We did all of this by investing over 20% of this year's profits back into our partners and stores through wages, training, equipment and new store growth. All this is further evidence that our strategy is working.\nTurning to International. In the fourth quarter, we saw record store growth of nearly 600 stores across the segment, with International store count remaining higher than that of the U.S. We also experienced record double-digit revenue growth internationally in the quarter, with continued growth on every key market around the world.\nOur comparable same-store sales in our company-operated markets for both the U.K. and Japan remained well above historical averages in fiscal year 2023, with growth attributed to higher profitability and higher productivity store formats, as well as elevated digital and partner experiences. We saw strong customer demand for our beverage and food offerings around the world with record global demand for our pumpkin platform.\nAnd in our international license markets, Starbucks Rewards programs grew by 4 million 90-day active members, now contributing to 30% of total sales, up 9 percentage points in just 1 year, driven by the growth for Starbucks Digital Solutions. Supported by our strong brand globally, outside of China, our International segment is well ahead of the growth pace we indicated at last year's Investor Day, with focused growth in our company-operated markets and motivated business partners powering our licensed stores.\nTurning to China. We were pleased with our performance in the quarter. delivering revenue growth of 8% from the prior year or up 15% when excluding approximately 6% impact of foreign currency translation. This has further supported by a comp of 5% squarely in line with our expectations. Full year revenue grew to $3 billion, up 3% from the prior year or up 11% excluding approximately 8% impact foreign currency translation with comp of 2%.\nOur performance in China improved sequentially quarter-over-quarter, with revenue in the second half of the year 20% higher than the first half, reflecting our growth momentum. These results underscore the strength of beverage and food offerings, the success of our market strategies and the powerful execution unleashed by our partners in China as we capture the abundant opportunities in front of us.\nWe continue to see strength from coffee-forward innovations, delighting our customers with locally relevant product innovation like the Moose Espresso and the smaller-sized Intenso range, a first in the world. We're also seeing higher food sales with tremendous headroom in this area, driving both transaction and ticket opportunities.\nIn Q4, we saw continued momentum across the omnichannel experiences of Starbucks in China with strength in store through Mobile Order & Pay, Mobile Order Delivery, E-commerce and in channels. China now has over [ 21 million ] active loyalty members, representing 22% year-over-year growth, with many members skewing younger to build our next generation of customers.\nIn the quarter, we opened a record 326 net new purpose-driven stores in China, reaching 13% net new store growth over the prior year to over 6,800 stores at the end of fiscal year 2023. The outstanding financial returns of new stores give us confidence we will reach our goal of 9,000 stores by 2025, opening nearly 1,000 net new stores every year.\nFinally, the September opening of the China Coffee Innovation Park, designed to be our most energy-efficient and sustainable coffee manufacturing and distribution center in the world, further signaled our commitment to the largest consumer market in the world and the growth of our business in China for China. We look forward to sharing more on the headroom we see in China later today.\nThe momentum against the backdrop of headwinds in China this past year gives us optimism in our position and affirm our distinctive competitive advantages for our business. These advantages include our uplifting partners, including our China leadership team, our distinctive stores, our vertically integrated and highly digitized efficient operations, and our relevant innovation. We will maintain our leading position in the premium market as we continue to grow in scale across our current portfolio and through new tiers of cities in this growing market of coffee drinkers.\nFinally, our channel business continues to elevate the Starbucks brand around the world at home and on the go, creating Starbucks moments for consumers outside of our retail stores. We're the #1 ready-to-drink brand around the world. Notably, in the fourth quarter, we celebrated our 5-year partnership with the Global Coffee Alliance with Nestlé.\nThis Nestlé relationship, which includes We Proudly Serve Food service locations as well as additional partnerships, such as our Nova Mera channel partnership with PepsiCo and international partners like Tingyi and Arla have helped us grow our customer touch points, and is now in nearly 90 markets around the world.\nFor fiscal year 2023, we saw notable growth in our leading channel market position as well as accretive brand equity as we continue to be recognized for our innovation. Some notable accolades include awards in China Ready Select, in the Europe, Middle East, Africa multiserve business as well as achieving 1 billion in servings in Korea and selling out of Grab & Go in Japan.\nIn closing, while navigating an environment of unprecedented volatility throughout fiscal year 2023, we finished our fourth quarter and full year strong delivering on our guidance. Our reinvention is moving ahead of schedule, fueling revenue growth, efficiency and margin expansion. Notably, we continue to see the positive impact of our reinvention on our partner and customer experiences, proof points that we can continue to innovate, grow and strengthen our business while creating value for all.\nLooking ahead, we remain fully optimistic about our headroom across the U.S. and internationally, and we see limitless possibilities across all areas of the business. While the global business environment remains uncertain, we are confident in our ability to adapt and innovate to meet evolving consumer needs. We will continue to invest in our partners to expand upon our reinvention and to deliver on our sustainability and social impact initiatives, all while driving long-term growth.\nWe feel very good about the business momentum for next year, the continued strength of the brand and the opportunity for growth in the years ahead. I look forward to sharing greater detail around these strategies for growth with you later this afternoon. Our performance this past year and the plans ahead give us great confidence in the multiple paths we have in front of us to achieve our long-term results.\nI will now hand the call over to Rachel to walk you through further details of the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2023 results, as well as our fiscal year 2024 guidance. Thank you all for joining us this morning, and we look forward to seeing you this afternoon. Rachel?\n\nRachel Ruggeri\n\nExecutive VP, CFO & Principal Accounting Officer\n\nThank you, Laxman, and good morning, everyone. I'm very pleased to discuss our strong Q4 and full fiscal year 2023 performance, which delivered on our full year guidance shared at the 2022 Investor Day. Our fiscal year 2023 double-digit earnings growth was a direct result of both double-digit revenue growth and margin expansion, as our focus and disciplined execution of our reinvention delivered tangible financial results.\nOur Q4 consolidated revenue reached a record $9.4 billion, up 9% from the prior year or up 12% when excluding a 1% impact of foreign currency translation. As Laxman mentioned, the U.S. business delivered strong performance with record breaking average weekly sales from an overwhelmingly successful fall launch, and our International business was also strong, with China performing in line with our expectations. Combined, this resulted in our consolidated comparable store sales growth of 8% and net new company-operated store growth of 7% globally over the prior year, as well as sustained momentum in our global licensed markets.\nQ4 consolidated operating margin expanded 310 basis points from the prior year to 18.2%, exceeding our expectations, primarily driven by increased efficiency throughout our U.S. stores as our strong execution on reinvention amplified results even greater than we anticipated, coupled with sales leverage and pricing. Margin expansion continued to be partially offset by our investments in store partners as well as higher G&A costs and support of reinvention.\nQ4 EPS was $1.06, up 31% from the prior year, driven by strong performance across our segments, especially the U.S., as its results were bolstered by the amplified success of our reinvention. For fiscal year 2023, our consolidated revenue reached a record $36 billion, up 12% from the prior year or up 14% when excluding approximately 2 percentage impact of foreign currency translation.\nConsistent with our guidance, our revenue growth included 8% comparable store growth and 7% net new company-operated store growth over prior year, as well as ongoing contributions from our global licensed store businesses. Our fiscal year 2023 consolidated op margin was 16.1%, up 100 basis points versus prior year. And EPS of $3.54 was up 20% over prior year. above our recent guidance of 16% to 17%. I'll now provide segment highlights for Q4.\nNorth America delivered another quarter of record revenue with $6.9 billion in Q4, up 12% from the prior year, driven by a combination of an 8% increase in comparable store sales, consisting of 6% and 2% growth in average ticket and transactions, respectively, as well as net new company-operated store growth of 4% over the prior year and contributions from our licensed store business, which continues to benefit from increased travel. When considering growth from all stores, comp new and licensed, we were pleased to see more than 2/3 of our growth came from transactions, mix, attach and customization, which we collectively call demand.\nOur U.S. business delivered 8% comparable store sales growth in Q4, primarily driven by strong ticket performance with 6% comp growth, which benefited from volume, mix, attach, customization and pricing. Our customers continue to favor more premium beverages, creating a new normal as it relates to mix and customization. To fuel this, we continue to lean in with innovation, offering our Iced Pump Cream Chai Tea Latte, which boosted tea cells; as well as Pumpkin Cream Cold Foam, which become a customization favorite with our customers.\nIn addition to our beverage success, we also had another record quarter of food attached, driven by both our core breakfast sandwiches and promotional items, such as our Baked Apple Croissant. The success we're having in driving incremental spend gives us confidence that we're delivering meaningful value and a differentiated experience to our customers.\nTransaction comparable sales growth in the quarter was 2%, which, combined with another quarter of a record ticket, drove multiple record average weekly sales, including delivering our sixth highest sales weeks ever, driven by our successful fall launch. Demand continued outside of our promotion windows, which translates to future opportunity as we leverage targeted offers to our most loyal customers, increasing efficiency as we create a more personalized experience.\nAs it relates to demand, it was another record-breaking quarter for key aspects of our Starbucks Rewards program, active members, spend per member and total member spend, which all surpassed previous highs. To further illustrate the strength of demand, we saw total customer growth among our occasional customers as well. Collectively, this demand speaks to the stickiness of our business. That, coupled with increased customer connection scores and growth across transactions, mix, customization and attach, all leads to a durable and growing business.\nU.S. licensed store revenue remained strong in Q4, up 18% from the prior year, benefiting from consumers adopting pre-covid routines of summer and business travel and expanded digital offerings, such as MOP and airports and curbside at select retailers, enabling us with more ways to meet our customers where they are, supporting increasing demand. North America's operating margin was 23.2% in Q4, expanding 420 basis points from the prior year, driven by increased efficiency in our stores, largely from reinvention, sales leverage and favorable impacts of pricing, partially offset by continued investment in our partners.\nMoving on to International. In the quarter, the segment delivered $2 billion in revenue, up 11% from the prior year or up 15% when excluding approximately 3% impact from foreign currency translation. Our revenue growth momentum continues off of a remarkable prior quarter and stems from double-digit growth in the majority of our international regions demonstrating global strength.\nThe segment delivered a 5% increase in comparable store sales driven by a 6% transaction growth, as store traffic increased and digital engagement continued with an increasing Starbucks Rewards member base. In addition, the International segment delivered 12% net new company-operated store growth year-over-year, with China contributing a significant portion of store growth as they had their highest store openings this year, equating to almost 4 new store openings daily in Q4, exceeding our expectations. Collectively, the segment surpassed the 20,000 store mark with ample headroom for growth across markets in the years to come.\nShifting to China. As Laxman shared, China's revenue in the quarter and on a full year basis grew by double digits driven by strength in our new stores and comparable store sales growth of 5%. Importantly, China's average weekly sales grew quarter-over-quarter, in line with our guidance of low to mid-single-digit growth. Comparable store sales growth of 5% was driven by strong transaction growth of 8% over the prior year, reflecting the strong brand affinity we create with locally relevant food and beverage and the consistent experience our partners deliver with every visit, differentiating us in the market.\nWe continue to see long-term growth in China with significant opportunities in dayparts, digital offerings and store format, and accordingly, continue to make investments for the future of our partners, stores and local community. Notably, in the quarter, as Laxman shared, we opened the Coffee Innovation Park, our largest roasting plant outside of the U.S., demonstrating our unwavering commitment to our business in China.\nOperating margin for the International segment was 15.2% in Q4, expanding 70 basis points over the prior year, driven by sales leverage partially offset by digital investments. We are pleased with our margin, reflecting the strength of business and enabling us to unlock capital to reinvest back in the business to fuel growth.\nShifting to channel development. The segment's revenue was $486 million in Q4, essentially flat over the prior year, in line with our expectations. This was driven largely by at-home coffee, while probably holding the #1 share position in the category at 16.1%, as well as the #1 position in ready-to-drink achieving our highest share in 2 years. Our fall launch in conjunction with our North America coffee partnership drove our performance resulting in the segment growing better than overall category.\nSegment's operating margin was 55.8% in Q4, up an impressive 520 basis points from prior year and exceeding our expectations, driven by ongoing strong performance in the North America coffee partnership. This segment continues to be highly margin accretive to our business and we're excited by the significant profit growth we're seeing in this channel.\nShifting to our fiscal year 2024 guidance. Our guidance accounts for the macroeconomic and geopolitical environment as we see it today. Additionally, our guidance does not include any impact from foreign currency translation. First, let me start with the foundation of our growth, comparable sales growth.\nWe expect fiscal year 2024 global comp growth to be 5% to 7%. While this is a change from our prior year global comp guidance of 7% to 9%, our comp range, coupled with our strong new store performance and momentum in our licensed business, drives a broader and more durable growth narrative supporting our attractive consolidated revenue growth.",
        "content2": "For color, our fiscal year 2024 U.S. comparable store sales are expected to grow in the range of 5% to 7% as our business continues to have substantial headroom spurred by our leading innovation and technology, increasing customer loyalty and strong digital engagement as evidenced by the U.S. finishing fiscal year 2023 with strong performance of 9% comp growth.\nAnother positive driver of our fiscal year 2024 5% to 7% global comp growth is the performance in China, with comp expected to be in the range of 4% to 6% in Q2 through Q4, with a higher comp in Q1 as we lap prior year mobility restrictions. Such growth is fueled by our increasing digital capability, coupled with the local opportunity we see stemming from our relevant product innovation and purpose-designed stores, which are resonating with customers and driving engagement. Our new store performance, combined with our strong China comp guidance, will give another year of double-digit revenue growth in the market, delivering on our momentum.\nNext, in thinking of our global new store growth, we expect global new store growth of approximately 7%, with approximately 75% of the growth still coming from outside of the U.S. as we continue to focus on our strategic global expansion, reaching nearly 41,000 stores globally by the end of fiscal year 2024. We -- of the approximate 7% growth, we expect our U.S. store count to grow by approximately 4% in fiscal year 2024, driven by our dynamic portfolio format, expanding our white space opportunity.\nWe anticipate China will continue its rapid growth of approximately 13% in fiscal year 2024, given the attractive unit economics of our new stores. We expect the remainder of our growth will be driven by the robust development in our other markets around the world that are leveraging the strength of our brand internationally and becoming more global.\nThe combination of our global comp growth that I discussed a few minutes ago and our global store growth as well as continued growth in our licensed business, sets the foundation of our consolidated revenue growth. For fiscal year 2024, we expect our consolidated revenue growth to continue in the range of 10% to 12%, albeit at the low end of the range. This does not include any impact from foreign currency translation.\nWe expect the foundational elements of our growth will be partially offset by an expected high single-digit revenue decline in our Channel Development segment largely related to the sale of Seattle's Best Coffee and broad optimization. Absent those impacts, Channel Development revenue is expected to be flat year-over-year. We're proud to reinforce yet another year of double-digit revenue growth at the low end of a 10% to 12% range, building on a very strong fiscal year 2023 performance, all of which reinforces the confidence we have in our business and opportunities we see ahead.\nShifting to operating margin. We expect progressive margin expansion in fiscal year 2024 as we continue to deliver efficiency both in and out of our stores, inclusive of approximately $1 billion in incremental high-return, growth-oriented investments balanced across our partners, stores and customers across wages, new store equipment and enhancements, digital and product innovation and supply chain modernization.\nWe will also continue our focus and discipline in unlocking strategic efficiencies across our business, and have multiple work streams underway to support approximately $1 billion in incremental leverage opportunity. These efficiencies, paired with sales leverage and strategic pricing, support continued investment in our business even as we expand margin and grow earnings over the long term. We will provide greater detail around our efficiency work streams in our strategy meeting later today.\nIn addition, we expect our Channel Development segment to continue to be accretive to overall operating margin, with operating margin expanding to the high 40% to low 50% range from their favorable portfolio mix.\nMoving on to capital allocation. Through a very disciplined approach to capital allocation, our return on invested capital in fiscal year 2023 approach 25%, a meaningful improvement from prior year. Equally important, we expect this upward trajectory to continue in fiscal year 2024. We expect our CapEx in fiscal year 2024 to be approximately $3 billion, with over 85% of our CapEx directly invested in our global store portfolio.\nWe also expect to continue our stable dividend approach and remain committed to targeting an approximate 50% dividend payout ratio, displaying our confidence in our long-term growth and attracting a broad investor base, which benefits all stakeholders. As one of the highest dividend payers among high-growth companies, we are proud to have recently commemorated our 13th consecutive annual dividend increase with a CAGR of 20% over such period.\nOur capital allocation strategy has positioned us well to be able to continue significant business investments while retaining financial flexibility and maintaining our BBB+ investment grade credit rating. Regarding tax rates in fiscal year 2024, we expect our effective GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates to be in the mid-20% range. This is higher than our fiscal year 2023 GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates of 23.6%, which benefited from certain discrete tax items that are not expected to reoccur in fiscal year 2024.\nIn closing my guidance comments, we continue to expect fiscal year 2024 GAAP and non-GAAP EPS growth to be in the 15% to 20% range. Proudly, we expect our double-digit EPS growth will be a result of a balanced plan, compromised of both revenue growth and margin expansion.\nOverall, we are pleased with the durability of our business and strong foundation fiscal 2023 has set for fiscal year 2024, and our guidance is a product of our confidence in our continued long-term growth. We look forward to telling you more about our limitless opportunities in our afternoon strategy meeting.\nBefore I close and turn it over to Tiffany, I want to thank the more than 450,000 partners who wear the green apron across the globe for their tireless contributions to create the experience that makes Starbucks such a meaningful place for all of our customers. It's because of you that I have such great confidence in the opportunity ahead. Tiffany?\n\nTiffany Willis\n\nVice President of Head of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Rachel. At this time, we'll proceed with our normal Q&A session, which will last until the top of the hour. Just for clarification, this Q&A session shall be focused on our fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2023 results and fiscal year 2024 guidance. Questions on topics outside of either of those should be held into our afternoon strategy meeting.\nKevin, please open the call for questions."

My name is Diego, and I will be your conference operator today. I would like to welcome everyone to Starbucks Third Fiscal Year 2023 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Tiffany Willis, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Willis, you may now begin your conference.\n\nTiffany Willis\n\nVice President of Head of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Diego, and good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Starbucks' third quarter fiscal year 2023 results. Today's discussion will be led by Laxman Narasimhan, Chief Executive Officer; Rachel Ruggeri, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. And for Q&A, we will be joined by Belinda Wong, Chairwoman and Chief Executive Officer of Starbucks China.\nThis conference call will include forward-looking statements, which are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. Any such statements should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements in our earnings release and risk factors discussed in our filings with the SEC, including our latest annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly report on Form 10-Q. Starbucks assumes no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements or information.\nGAAP results in third quarter fiscal year 2023 and the comparative period include several items related to strategic actions, including restructuring and impairment charges, transaction and integration costs and other items. These items are excluded from our non-GAAP results. All numbers referenced on today's call are on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted or there is no non-GAAP adjustment related to the metric.\nFor non-GAAP financial measures mentioned in today's call, please refer to the earnings release and on our website at investor.starbucks.com to find reconciliations of those non-GAAP measures to their corresponding GAAP measures.

Also for your planning purposes, please note that our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2023 earnings call has been scheduled for Thursday, November 2, 2023. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Laxman.\n\nLaxman Narasimhan\n\nChief Executive Officer - Elect\n\nThank you, Tiffany, and thank you all for joining us this afternoon. In a few moments, Rachel Ruggeri will walk you through the detailed results of the third quarter, and Belinda Wong would then join us for Q&A.\nTo start, our strong third quarter results point to all-around momentum in the business. This quarter, we grew consolidated revenue by 12%, up 14% when excluding more than a 1% impact in foreign currency translation to a record $9.2 billion. Importantly, earnings growth of 19% outpaced revenue growth with margin expanding by 50 basis points to 17.4%. Our strong performance reflects the strengthened foundation of our business, resulting from the significant progress we are making against our reinvention plan.\nSince stepping into the role, I have now traveled to every region, working directly with partners. I left each interaction impressed by the differentiated global appeal of the Starbucks brand powered by innovation and anchored in our unique ability to deliver human connection. These experiences give me great confidence in the significant growth and margin opportunities in front of us, positioning us well to strengthen the brand and create outsized long-term shareholder value.\nIt was this time last year when Howard and the team identified the must-win opportunities and investments for our foundational reinvention plan. While Rachel will walk you through detailed results, I will now outline the momentum we have from the quarter in 5 key priority areas while pointing out where we see further headroom. Our first priority, we will elevate the brand by running great stores. This comes to life in the strengthened execution in North America.\nOur North America team delivered record revenue in the quarter, with a growth of 11% underpinned by 7% comparable same-store sales growth, leading to the highest average weekly sales in our history. Our ticket growth was driven by pricing, customization and food attach. Additionally, we continue to see improvements in items sold per labor hour. Operationally, we are seeing evidence that we are executing better. Barista attrition, where we are already industry-leading, has improved further by 11% year-over-year.\nThrough scheduling and staffing improvements, we are beginning to increase the number of hours per partner in store, critical to running great stores and improving partner engagement while also improving productivity. Innovation in beverage and equipment continues to drive our business. In fact, our cold business reached 75% of U.S. beverage sales this past quarter. As the leader in premium coffee, we are particularly encouraged to see cold espresso beverages were up 13% year-over-year.\nAdditionally, we continue to elevate the premium coffee experience in both cold and hot. For example, the rollout of our Clover Vertica brewer continues as planned, delivering a larger variety of high-quality hot coffee, including decaffeinated on demand. Our innovative equipment rollout remains on track, are faster and easier to use portable handheld cold form blenders continue to have an outsized impact for both the partner and customer experience. The cold foam blenders are now rolled out to all U.S. company-operated stores in time to meet the summer demand for Starbucks Refreshers' frozen beverages. The new blenders support the additional growth of cold foam, the fastest-growing customization at Starbucks. Modifiers such as cold foam now contribute to over $1 billion in revenue annually.\nThe Mastrena 2 espresso machines and new warming ovens are also now in all U.S. company-operated stores. Taken all together, our equipment investments that we began last year are supporting labor efficiencies, allowing us to increase capacity during our busiest day parts. These investments are both elevating the Starbucks Experience and further differentiating us from competitors.\nIn this past quarter in North America, we once again saw our unit volume outpace pre-COVID levels by double digits with high attach rates across dayparts, the mornings as well as the afternoons. Also in thinking about dayparts, our Starbucks Refreshers platform, which skews to [indiscernible] occasion has seen double-digit growth this past quarter in every daypart. With this success, we are leaning in even further with a systematic pipeline of innovation across dayparts. This includes this summer's launch of our Starbucks Refreshers frozen beverages, customization in our Oleato beverage platform as well as with our cold-pressed Cold Brew, which enters a testing phase across a few dozen stores this fourth quarter with a rollout across U.S. company-owned stores expected by the end of fiscal year 2024.\nFood is also fueling growth. This past quarter, we saw all-time high food attach and sales of breakfast sandwiches. As an attached business, food drove a higher ticket in the quarter, improving volume growth and contributing to the record average weekly sales. Overall, we are excited about the significant opportunity in food as we explore new, elevated and convenient food offerings. We will share more of this in time.\nWe also continue to grow and diversify our store portfolio. We see significant headroom for new store growth in underpenetrated areas in the U.S., including smaller cities as well as new formats in larger metros. New stores and remodels are where we are first prioritizing our Siren System equipment rollout, and we plan to move all stores to brand-forward digital menu boards over the next couple of years to further sharpen personalization and daypart activation.\nWe are seeing strong growth in delivery. In fact, we are close to creating a $1 billion incremental leg in our delivery business from minimal presence a few years ago. And now we are operationally setting ourselves up for this channel in major markets, starting from a position of strength.\nAs a second strategic priority, we're looking ahead at how we will further strengthen and differentiate our leadership position in digital. In the third quarter, we continued to grow our digital universe. Our 90-day active Starbucks Rewards customers grew to nearly 75 million globally, growing more than 25% in the quarter. This was driven by a record 90-day active user base of 31.4 million Starbucks Rewards customers in the U.S., an approximate 15% growth or 4 million new customers from the previous year.\nStarbucks Rewards members in the U.S. drove 57% of tender for the second consecutive quarter, up over 3 percentage points from the prior year. In China, we hit the highest number of 90-day active users we have ever had at over 20 million Starbucks Rewards customers. This is further evidence of our brand strength, relevance and customer engagement in the market.\nStarbucks has had a long track record of industry-leading digital innovation. As we approach the fundamental platform transformation underway with AI, we intend to invest to lead in this area using a foundational Deep Brew capability as the launching pad. Our focus in these investments will remain on improving the partner experience while elevating the customer experience and delivering productivity gains. We are revamping our approach to further accelerate digital innovation, including order, including payment and delivery enhancements, in terms of speed and personalization, which we believe leads to greater habituation by our customers. This includes developments in the U.S. mobile app user experience as well. Additionally, we plan to make significant investments in China to further enhance our digital capabilities in the market.\nOur third priority is global growth. As a company with over 100 million customer occasions each week, more than 37,000 stores and operating in 86 markets around the world, the runway for global growth is limitless. For the quarter, we again saw double-digit top line growth across the International segment. The segment delivered record system sales for the second consecutive quarter as well as the highest revenue and operating margin since the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021. Excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange, we continue to see double-digit growth in the company-owned markets of Japan and the U.K., while the geographic license partners across the rest of the world all reported very strong performance. Our international store growth was 10% year-over-year. New stores are bringing attractive unit economics for the business while we benefit from strong growth in returns on invested capital in these markets.\nTurning to China. I am encouraged by our performance in the quarter. I had the opportunity to spend time in the market recently. I can now fully appreciate the extraordinary strength and resilience of the Starbucks brand, which is known as Xing ba kè. Looking at our third quarter results, our China revenue grew 51% from the prior year or up 60% when excluding a 9% impact of foreign currency translation. Additionally, we sequentially grew our revenue 8% from the prior quarter or up 10% when excluding a 2% impact of foreign currency translation, underscoring the robust long-term health of our business.\nDespite these early days in our recovery journey, stores that opened in fiscal year 2019 or earlier achieved full sales recovery in the routine morning daypart while other dayparts reported sequential monthly improvement. A strong recovery in the third quarter was amplified by the many distinctive competitive advantage that set us apart in China. The first and foremost advantages are in comparable partners who honor the heritage of our company, bring sophisticated appreciation for our high-quality coffee and passion for delivering the Starbucks Experience in ways that are relevant to our Chinese customers.\nOur second advantage is our vertically integrated operations. We start with a locally relevant and increasingly greener store footprint. Our distinctively designed stores across formats celebrate the Chinese culture in a unique Xing ba kè manner, reflecting local arts, crafts and calligraphy. In the fall, we plan to open our Coffee Innovation Park, our single largest and most sustainable manufacturing investment outside of the U.S. This next-generation facility with state-of-the-art supply chain operations will also include a unique customer immersion center.\nThird, our locally relevant innovation in China for over 20 years has won over customers in what has historically been a tea-drinking culture. Today, we have nearly 6,500 stores and another nearly 2,400 points of customer connection through our We Proudly Serve program in China. And yet, there is so much more opportunity ahead in underpenetrated areas within this market.\nSome growth facts to think about. The average person in China drinks 12 cups of coffee each year. That significantly lower coffee consumption than in Tier 1 cities like Shanghai, where we first entered the market and now have nearly 1,100 stores. And we still have more room to grow in Shanghai. Compare this also to Japan where our per capita is 200 cups versus the 12 cups in China and the U.S., where the per capita is closer to 380.\nWe are still in our early days in China, one of the largest consumer markets. With our locally-based investments in R&D and locally relevant offerings like our Dragon dumplings, which had an amazing quarter. We have built a brand that is highly relevant for China, in China. And we believe our unique approach has us well positioned to play the long game and win.\nFinally, another advantage in China is digital. This will be further demonstrated with highly digital supply chains we run and in the way we engage our customers. We are reshaping our business models, leaning into the remarkable loyalty of our Starbucks Rewards members as well as convenience offerings, including delivery and curbside for our On-The-Go business.\nA comment on our international business beyond the U.S. and China. We have seen very strong growth and strong unit economics in these markets. It is becoming an important third leg for us. Looking outside the stores in the third quarter, our Channel Development segment revenue was $449 million, down 6% year-over-year, while delivering operating margin of 46.3%, up 630 basis points year-over-year, reflecting SKU rationalization as well as the shifts taking place with a more on-the-go customer.\nWe continue to see the opportunity for growth in channel-through innovation, as evidenced by the highly successful ready-to-drink Starbucks Pink Drink and Starbucks Paradise Drink introduced last quarter and the Grab and Go series launched in Japan in partnership with Suntory. We saw unprecedented sales during the first month of the launch in Japan, just as we did with our cream cheese lattes in China.\nOur fourth strategic priority is fueling productivity. We think of our business as a theater in the front and a factory in the back. We have a clear opportunity to maximize efficiencies and effectiveness while reducing waste by focusing on a vast opportunity in stores and also above stores. We have focused on meaningful improvements in staffing and scheduling to ensure that we have the right combination of the right partners in the right roles with the right hours to fuel both engagement and productivity. We also closed the third quarter on target with our waste reduction goals as we strive to make operations as efficient as possible while preserving the Starbucks Experience.\nThis is just the beginning of the productivity journey at Starbucks. We have broadened the areas beyond our initial reinvention plan to include our end-to-end supply chain, direct and indirect procurement, how we design and build stores as well as opportunities across technology and our supporting processes. Arthur Valdez, Jr., who joined us recently as the Chief Supply Chain Officer, brings 3 decades of supply chain and logistics leadership to Starbucks and will be critical in these efforts. Along with sales leverage, what I could see in opportunities with future productivity gains gives me real confidence in long-term progressive margin expansion.\nFinally, the DNA of Starbucks is nothing without our culture. This is inherent to the company and something I was quick to learn through my immersion and experience working in stores. Our fifth strategic priority is reinvigorating our culture of human connection. We will measure our success on our business performance through the lens of humanity, just as we always have. And that requires us to reinvigorate our culture. Our partners are the heart of our business for me.\nWe will continue to invest in the overall partner experience through compensation and benefits as well as through in-store improvements. At Starbucks, we strive to be a different kind of company, but we do recognize that we are operating in a different kind of world. It is through that lens we have spent the last several months rolling out a new unifying mission for the company, new promises for all our stakeholders and soon, a new set of values that will reground the culture of Starbucks in our heritage and a more modernized workplace.\nBefore I turn the call over to Rachel, I want to leave you with this. It is an honor to be driving such a stellar branded company in one of its best chapters. While we continue to navigate in an environment with a heightened level of macro uncertainty around the world, we will execute with discipline and rigor on our priorities. After all, Starbucks is a strong, resilient brand delivering to customers what the world needs most right now, human connection.\nAs I look at the runway in front of us, the possibilities to deliver that connection are truly limitless. What I see is a durable iconic business with multiple paths available for us to deliver on our long-term revenue growth of 10% to 12% and earnings growth of 15% to 20%. I look forward to discussing our strategies and plans for fiscal year 2024 and beyond in greater detail in November in an extended investor call organized in a hybrid media format. We would share more details in the coming weeks. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Rachel to talk more about our remarkable third quarter financial performance of the quarter. Rachel?\n\nRachel Ruggeri\n\nExecutive VP, CFO & Principal Accounting Officer\n\nThank you, Laxman, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm very pleased to discuss our Q3 performance, which beat our expectations as our innovation and our brand continues to resonate with our customers around the world, fueling demand across our stores and digitally. Our U.S. business delivered record-breaking performance on many fronts, and our China business continued to recover in line with our expectations. It's clear we have abundant opportunity ahead.\nOur overall performance was bolstered by the progress we're making against our strategies, specifically our reinvention plan and it's unfolding into tangible financial results. As a reminder, when we set guidance at the beginning of the year, we said that the benefits from our reinvention plan would amplify at the back half of this fiscal year, and that is exactly what we're seeing, highlighting our ability to effectively reinvest in our business for the benefit of all stakeholders.\nOur Q3 consolidated revenue reached a record $9.2 billion, up 12% from the prior year or up 14% when excluding more than 1% impact of foreign currency translation. The strength of the brand, loyalty of our customers and innovative products fueled strong sales resulting in double-digit consolidated comparable store sales growth of 10%. In addition to the 10% comparable store sales growth, revenue also benefited from 7% net new company-operated store growth globally year-over-year as well as continued momentum in our global licensed market.\nQ3 consolidated operating margin expanded 50 basis points from the prior year to 17.4%, exceeding our expectations, primarily driven by sales leverage, pricing and productivity improvement from increased efficiency in our U.S. stores. Margin expansion was partially offset by investments in store partners as well as higher G&A costs in support of reinvention. Q3 EPS was $1, up 19% from the prior year, driven by strong performance across our business segments, demonstrating the power of a broad global portfolio.\nI'll now provide segment highlights for Q3. North America delivered another record quarter of revenue with $6.7 billion in Q3, up 11% from the prior year, primarily driven by a 7% increase in comparable store sales, consisting of 6% and 1% growth in average ticket and transactions, respectively, as well as net new company-operated store growth of 4% year-over-year. Our results were further strengthened by the continued momentum from our licensed store business.\nOur U.S. business delivered 7% comparable store sales growth in Q3, primarily driven by solid ticket performance with 6% growth, which benefited from a combination of pricing, food attach and customization. Our customers have relatively adopted the practice of customizing their beverages, allowing for a more personalized and differentiated experience while contributing to a growing higher-margin ticket with abundant opportunity ahead. In Q3, over 60% of beverages were customized, representing a 9% growth when compared to just 5 years ago. Cold Foam, for example, continues to be a customization favorite. This quarter's all-time high food attach was driven by 2 of every 5 customers attaching food with their orders, up over 25% from just 5 years ago, driven by our delicious breakfast sandwiches leading to an all-time high ticket in the quarter.\nTransaction comparable sales growth in the quarter was 1%, which combined with record ticket drove the highest average weekly sales in our company's history, surpassing the all-time high set during holiday in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023. We are seeing more customers come into our stores with customer counts up 5% year-over-year, in line with the record high set in Q1 of this fiscal year. Our growing tech-enabled convenience capabilities are driving our customers to engage more deeply with Starbucks as evidenced by the growth in customization, attach and mix shift towards more premium beverages, leading to record demand and incremental higher-margin revenue.\nAnother proof point of our continued demand is the ongoing success of our Starbucks Rewards program, which ended the quarter achieving records on many fronts, a record number of active members, spend per member and total member spend. These records alone reflect the stickiness of our business, but we are most pleased by the consistency of our customer connection stores, which highlights customer satisfaction and the delivery of the Starbucks Experience.\nU.S. licensed stores revenue continued its momentum this quarter, up 21% from the prior year with strength across the portfolio and [indiscernible] from increases in post-COVID travel, especially return of business travel, which benefits from Starbucks Connect, our digital offering, now rolled out across all major U.S. airports. North America's operating margin was 21.8% in Q3, contracting 40 basis points from the prior year as expected, primarily driven by the timing of productivity-focused labor investments as part of our reinvention plan. For color, the reinvention investments included partner wages and benefits as well as an increase in targeted partner training. The contraction was partially offset by favorable impacts of pricing coupled with labor productivity and sales leverage largely from the ramping benefits of the reinvention plan.\nMoving on to International. In the quarter, the segment delivered $2 billion in revenue, the highest revenue since Q4 of fiscal year 2021, up 24% from the prior year or up 30% when excluding more than 5% impact from foreign currency translation. Our revenue growth reflects double-digit growth in all major markets, including China, which benefited from lapping prior year mobility restrictions. The growth is attributable to a 24% increase in comparable store sales, which was driven by 21% transaction growth as customers continued returning to our stores, largely in China as well, as remarkable digital engagement through the increasing Starbucks Rewards member base.",
        "content2": "In addition, the International segment delivered 11% net new company-operated store growth year-over-year, with China contributing a significant portion of store growth as we continue to invest ahead of the curve in China, supporting our long-term ambitions for the market. Excluding China, our international markets combined continued their strong momentum with revenue growing 11% year-over-year in Q3 or up 14% when excluding a 3 percentage impact from foreign currency translation. The meaningful growth was a byproduct of our successful innovation and digital engagement across various markets.\nExcluding China, International had 8% store growth year-over-year and approximately 35% of our new stores year-to-date were drive-thru, resulting in approximately 15% of total store count having the drive-through channel furthering our ability to create new occasions and serve new customers globally.\nShifting to China. China had a strong quarter, delivering their highest beverage sales for Q3 over the last 5 years, underpinned by comparable store sales growth of 46% in Q3, in line with our expectations. Comp growth was driven by strong transactions, which benefited from the lapping prior year Q3 mobility restrictions. As the market continues to recover, we're pleased with the consistency of demand fueled by new product innovation, increasing digital capability, record sales of our Dragon Dumpling Festival food and an acceleration of new store openings amounting to nearly 3 stores per day.\nAverage weekly sales in China grew quarter-over-quarter and we expect this to continue into Q4 with average weekly sales growth of low to mid-single digits, resulting in similar-sized comp growth for the quarter. With the current demand and the long-term opportunity we see in China, we continue to invest in our stores, partners and communities. And we'll have our largest roasting plant outside of the U.S., the Coffee Innovation Park opening this fall. Our unwavering investments have contributed to our healthy recovery and performance, positioning us well for the long term.\nOperating margin for the International segment was 19% in Q3, expanding an impressive 660 basis points from the prior year, mainly driven by sales leverage from lapping prior year mobility restrictions in China, partially offset by investments in digital and partner wages as well as inflationary pressures.\nShifting to Channel Development. The segment's revenue contracted 6% year-over-year to $449 million in Q3, driven largely by at-home coffee while proudly holding the #1 share position at 15.1%. Despite the softening of revenue, the segment remained strong due to the breadth and depth of the portfolio. We are particularly proud of our North American coffee partnership, which continued to see category-leading sales and share growth outpacing the total category. Our innovation continues to distinguish us while benefiting the segment overall with strong performance.\nA perfect example of this is the award-winning ready-to-drink Starbucks Pink Drink and Starbucks Paradise Drink that Laxman mentioned earlier. The segment's operating margin was 46.3% in Q3, up a resounding 630 basis points from prior year, driven by strength in the North America coffee partnership and sales mix shift. As previously shared, operating margin has returned to the segment's normal mid-40s range, a testament of our strong partnerships and the benefits of a diversified portfolio.\nNow moving to guidance for the balance of fiscal year 2023. Given we're in the final quarter of our fiscal year with clear visibility into full year results, combined with the momentum we've built, the pace of reinvention plan unfolding and the strength of our global portfolio, we have the confidence to move our full year earnings growth from the plans we shared in November of the low end of the 15% to 20% growth range to a growth of 16% to 17% for full year fiscal year 2023.\nDespite the macroeconomic environment variables, we are poised to move our earnings growth guidance as it reflects the strength of our brand globally and the long-term durability that we are building through our reinvention plan. As it relates to our remaining guidance, we are pleased to reaffirm full year guidance on all other measures. As a reminder, that includes revenue growth of 10% to 12%, global comp growth near the high end of 7% to 9% and solid margin expansion. Store growth, capital spend and tax rate guidance also remain unchanged from what we shared previously. As a reminder, we expect an unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation of approximately 2 to 3 percentage points on fiscal year 2023 revenue and earnings, respectively.\nWith that, let me provide further detail around our Q4. First, in regard to International. Looking ahead to the balance of the year, we expect our International segment Q4 margin to expand year-over-year but to be meaningfully lower than Q3 due to seasonality along with accelerated digital and store renovation investments. Second, in regard to China, as I noted earlier, we expect China's average weekly sales to continue to sustain the growth quarter-over-quarter, resulting in average weekly sales growth of low to mid-single digits in Q4, with similar sized comp growth as the market is lapping government stimulus for customers and favorable discounting from prior year coupled with the timing of difference of the Mid-Autumn Festival, which all contributed to prior year transaction growth.\nWe continue to expect a low to mid-single-digit comp on a full year basis, consistent with our prior guidance as well as record-breaking year of net new store development. Finally, as it relates to Channel Development, we expect revenue pressures to continue in Q4, driven largely by the at-home coffee business as customer behavior shift with revenue expected to be largely flat to prior year. However, we expect margins will continue to be above the mid-40s range, driven by seasonality, leveling to a strong mid-40s margin business for the full year.\nIn summary, here are my key takeaways from my discussion today. Our momentum is in full swing and our strong brand, successful product innovations and financial and operational performance across the globe is a testament to our focus and our discipline. Our reinvention plan investments are unfolding and providing tangible returns throughout our business. As a result of our solid performance, our full year fiscal year 2023 guidance including revenue has been reiterated and we are confident to move our earnings growth to 16% to 17% for full year fiscal 2023.\nFinally, I want to say thank you to our partners around the globe for showing up every day and making customer's day brighter by extending active kindness. It's because of you that the future is truly limitless. With that, we'll open the call to Q&A. Operator?"

But we thought it would be beneficial to give Laxman, ample time to provide his observations as our new CEO. And now with that, I'll turn the call over to Laxman.\n\nLaxman Narasimhan\n\nChief Executive Officer - Elect\n\nThank you, Tiffany, and good afternoon, everyone. It's both a great privilege and responsibility to serve as Starbucks CEO. On behalf of the Board of Directors and our Starbucks partners, I'd like to thank Howard Schultz for his leadership of the company over the last year. Howard's return in April of 2022, and came at a pivotal moment for the company and with great personal and family sacrifice. And I want to personally thank Howard for his over 40 years of ingenuity, creativity, service and enduring love for our company and the iconic Starbucks brand and for his willingness to always lean in, in service of our partners and customers.\nSince joining in September, the company has given me a uniquely designed program to fully immerse myself in all aspects of our business. The program involves spending time in our stores, distribution centers, roasting plants, support centers and on our own coffee farm in Costa Rica. And I have traveled to meet our partners and business leaders in several international markets across Asia, Latin America and Europe. While Howard formally ran the company through the second quarter, my emotion exposed me to all aspects of day-to-day leadership responsibilities and well-prepared made transition into the CEO role on March 20, a few days ahead of our Annual Meeting of Shareholders.\nI have learned about the company through the eyes of our founder, customers, farmers, partners and the community and through listing meetings with our shareholders. Perhaps most importantly, I've been actively listening and learning from our partners, working side-by-side to earn my Barista certification and developing the deepest level of respect for coffee and Barista craft. In my time with the company, I have also been working closely with the executive leadership team. I have been impressed with the great progress and forward momentum of the company, and I am optimistic about our long-term growth headroom and the margin improvement potential.\nWe also see great opportunity to further strengthen the business, elevate the brand and do everything we can do to make this a great place for partners to work. We will continue to build our reinvention plan with additional opportunities, and we will update you with these additional plans in due course.\nLet me start with this call by sharing my overarching observations, the progress and momentum from our reinvention and the opportunities ahead for Starbucks. Rachel will then walk you through the details of our second quarter fiscal year 2023 performance. We will then open the call for Q&A. What you can take away today is confirmation that we are well positioned to continue to unlock value for all our stakeholders.\nMy first observation is that Starbucks is uniquely in the business of human connection. Since our earliest days, we have been a brand that brings people together from the vantage points of serving customers in stores and in drive-through windows. Many are coming to us for connection with others. There is no doubt, Starbucks has conventionally been the mainstay meet-up spot. At the same time, nearly 2/3 of U.S. consumers are by themselves when seeking a beverage or food occasion. As a world in a crisis of disconnection, where loneliness, division and polarization have become far too common, the everyday ritual of coffee is a powerful way to make connection happen with others and with yourself. Starbucks delivers connection no matter how you visit us, in stores, drive-throughs or digitally, we are there to provide this connection, any place, any time.\nThat brings me to my second observation. Our performance is strong, but our health could be stronger. I've worked side by side with our partners in our stores and have experienced firsthand how our stores and our operations are still evolving to meet the demands of our customers. There is more work to do to tailor our stores on the demand that we see, advance our technology, enhance how we innovate our equipment and also more fundamentally, how we get back to focusing on fundamental operations and executing better, a priority that is evident with my deep engagement over the last several months across supply chain, technology, reinvention, store development, store operations, marketing and product.\nTake, for example, the Siren System that we showcased at Investor Day. This is one example of how we can continue to do more to better support our stores and in turn our partners. It is also about the operating processes that we have in our stores and how we make them even more robust. To strengthen our health, we need to think of our business as having theaters to the front with a factory in the back. Our theaters aware our store partners are focusing on their craft and delivering an elevated experience to our customers. To simplify the store partner experience and drive greater productivity within and beyond the store level, we see significant efficiencies in our supply chain, support systems and processes. This is what I mean by our opportunity to strengthen our factory in the back.\nLet me give you a few examples. Today, our store deliveries involve a high-touch one-size-fits-all model. We are out of stock in more items than we would like. Through segmentation and a format-specific approach, we will be able to lower costs while creating a better experience for our partners and ultimately for our customers. We also have abundant opportunities to optimize what we buy across several areas as well as opportunities in how we buy it. Currently, we have over 1,500 cup and lid combinations across our network. As we streamline, we will create a portfolio of fewer, more sustainable and less costly hubs while further simplifying operations in our stores. All of these opportunities will deliver top line growth and margin expansion and create long-term value.\nMy third observation is that we are a company that strives to be different, and we are now operating in a different kind of world. One thing that has stood out to me here at Starbucks is our culture. Since my first it has been clear that Starbucks' cultures like that of no other company. There is a strong partner-first mentality that is both top down and bottom up. At the same time, the world in which we operate is evolving. There is clear opportunity to build stronger capabilities, drive even deeper engagement and adapt a global mindset. With that in mind, as a leadership team, we fully acknowledge the need to evolve and modernize our brand, our business, our capabilities and our culture to meet the needs of an ever-changing world. We are, therefore, refounding the company. And as part of that, we are getting back to its basics.\nYou already know about a reinvention. We've also just recently introduced a new mission in set of promises as a contemporary expression of our mutual success. Our mission is this. With every cup, with every conversation, with every community we nurture the limitless possibilities of human connection. The rollout of this work across the globe is well underway. It is driving conversations at all levels within the company and is being met with overwhelmingly positive reception. As we evolve, what differentiates us will remain. We will modernize, yes, and we will straight through to who we are at our core, much like our promises say. We are a company that at its best works to build bridges to a better future for our partners. At our best, we uplift the every day for our customers. At our best, we ensure the future of coffee for all. At our best, we make positive contributions to our communities. And at our best with the environment, we give back more than we take. And as a result, we generate enduring long-term returns for our shareholders.\nThese have been my 3 overarching observations. We are in the business of human connection. Our performance is strong, but our health can be stronger, enable the fearless in the front by strengthening the factories in the back, and we continue to strive to be a different kind of company that is now operating in a different kind of world. Through this lens, we will be disciplined in delivering against what has been limiting us in our journey towards the limitless future. We are seeing great progress in the work underway with our reinvention plan and the capacity for much more.\nWe've only just scratched the surface of what we can accomplish with this iconic brand and company. We see significant growth headroom and the opportunity to further separate Starbucks from others. We also see opportunities to expand margins while continuing to invest in the business for the long term.\nWith that, let me turn to our second quarter performance. The company exceeded expectations in Q2 fiscal year 2023 by nearly all measures, delivering strong results across the broader Starbucks portfolio. Our performance, including continued success in the U.S. and international markets as well as the recovery we've been seeing in China can be attributed to the strength of the global brand, relevant innovation in our product and stores and powerful execution by our partners.\nLet me first start globally and then with both America and the U.S. Our Q2 revenue was $8.7 billion, up 14% for the prior year and up 17%, excluding more than 2% impact of foreign currency translation. North America delivered revenue growth of 17% in Q2, growing to $6.4 billion. We captured a remarkable 11% comp growth globally with 12% comp growth in both North America and the U.S. for the second quarter, driven by mid-single-digit growth balanced between transactions and ticket. Our North America growth comes on top of 12% comp growth in the prior year. We expect this demand to continue as we push the envelope with innovation.\nA recent example is the highly successful launch of Oleato, an innovation Howard identified and is personally led for us. In fact, we have already reached an audience of 5 million people since our announcement of the February global launch, Starbucks Oleato beverages, making this 1 of the top 5 product launches in the last 5 years in terms of brand awareness and excitement. The new innovative beverage platform is currently available in 650 stores across 3 markets: Italy, Japan and the U.S. Given the success we are seeing, we look forward to bringing this exciting new offering to more stores and more markets around the world this year.\nScaled profitable innovation is one of the things that was our performance and is a continued area of focus. Our performance is the result of a near perfect intersection of 3 things: one, our successful innovative beverages suggests our Pistachio Cream Cold Brew, that inspires the expanded use of Two, our food portfolio, which resulted in record sales of our egg bytes and breakfast sandwiches. And three, our attractive convenience capabilities, Mobile Order & Pay, drive-thru and delivery, we saw sequential improvement and now accounts for 74% of Q2 U.S. company-owned revenue. You can expect us to lean strongly on purposeful innovation to further capture the tremendous opportunity, both in what we do and in how we do it.\nSpeaking of channels, our 90-day active Starbucks Awards membership added more than 400,000 members in the quarter in the U.S., bringing our total membership to 30.8 million members. In addition, we've increased membership by 4 million year-over-year in the U.S. representing 15% growth. Rewards and members account for 57% of U.S. company-operated revenue in Q2, which marks the highest contribution on record and represents growth of 3% on a year-over-year basis. We are excited about our growth in active Rewards members as it's a contributing factor and consistent demand. We have been at vanguard in this area, and you can expect us to further invest and lead.\nAn example of that investment is Starbucks Connect, which is now in over 1/3 of our U.S. licensed stores, giving our customers even more opportunities to engage with our brand. With such a diverse portfolio across our U.S. license locations, such as hotels, airports and other retailers, coupled with increasing offerings of convenience, we were able to capture further demand evidenced by revenue in the quarter, up 25% year-over-year supporting our strategy to meet and serve our customers wherever they are.\nMoving on to reinvention. We are making great progress. The investments we made in our partners, stores and technology are already producing a return whether through productivity gains or partner satisfaction. We are pleased with the multifaceted progress to date. For example, Barista turnover reduced by over 9% from a high in March Q2 fiscal year 2022, leading to fewer newer highs per store. We've been able to increase the average hours per Barista per week by 4% year-over-year, a metric we know is one of the many meaningful inputs in achieving the desired compensation of our partners. Clearly, partners scheduling is a real opportunity for us, and we are laser-focused on it.\nAdditionally, items per labor hour, a metric which reached a record high in December 2022, continued strong pace into and throughout Q2 despite seasonal trends. This demonstrates increased productivity in the midst of strong volumes, all by partner engagement and customer connection scores stabilized. The rollout of handheld cold foam blenders supporting customization demand commenced in the quarter with completion targeted for third quarter, just in time to support our summer demand as the desire for cold foam customization continues to grow. The Clover vertical brewers also began to roll out in this quarter, and we'll be in nearly 40% of our company-operated stores across the U.S. by the end of this fiscal year. The vertical offers our customers our freshest Clover brewed coffee, while driving efficiencies in time and waste across our network. This is yet another example of how innovation amplifies what we do best, in this case, coffee served even better.\nThe ultimate proof point of innovation and the progress against our reinvention is our Q2 margin in North America of 19.2%, a 200 basis point expansion year-over-year. We have more to do to reinvent our business. Though we have further opportunity ahead, we are proud to see that our strategies are working and momentum is building.\nMoving on to International. We are pleased with the strength and growth across our broader portfolio. Q2 revenue was $1.9 billion, up 9% for the prior year and up 19% excluding 10% impact of foreign currency translation, representing our third highest quarterly revenue due largely to China's faster-than-expected recovery. We also achieved the highest ever quarterly system sales internationally, and we delivered a company-operated 7% comp, driven by transaction growth, spotlighting demand. Strong comps were also captured across the regions outside of China with markets like Japan and the U.K., both posting double-digit comps for the eighth consecutive quarter.\nWe're very pleased to see our International store strategy is working. In the quarter, our net new stores grew by 363, representing 8% growth year-over-year. As we look ahead to the end of the fiscal year, we will reach 20,000 stores across the International segment on pace with a growth strategy we outlined at Investor Day.\nWe expect China to remain on track to achieve our 13% net new store growth target for this year. Additionally, Asia Pacific, EMEA and Latin American markets, are also expected to contribute meaningfully, becoming an area of further emphasis and a more significant contributor to our overall global growth.\nMoving on to China. Q2 marked a significant turning point when we finally began to emerge on 3 years of unprecedented COVID disruptions, embarking on the recovery journey that we have envisioned. We saw a robust recovery in Q2, reinforcing the resilience of our partners, the strength of our brand and the close relationships that we have built with our customers. We experienced faster-than-expected recovery, closing the quarter with nearly $800 million in revenue, up 3% from the prior year and up 11% excluding the 8% impact of foreign currency translation. Comp growth of 3% marked the first positive comp since the third quarter of fiscal year 2021. Importantly, we accelerated our store development in the quarter, opening 153 net new stores, more than doubling the net new stores in the previous quarter. We now operate over 6,200 stores across 244 cities, keeping us on track to meet our goal of 9,000 stores by 2025. Our bold decision to continue opening new stores over the past 3 years, despite COVID disruptions in mobility restrictions, is paying off as they continue to deliver returns and profitability.\nFurther accelerating recovery is our rapidly expanding omnichannel business. Starbucks delivers -- achieved 21% year-on-year growth to make up 23% of the sales mix, while overall mobile ordering reached 47% of sales, 4% over the prior year. Delivery demand remained robust even after consumer mobility has recovered demonstrating that it is highly incremental and interwoven into our customers' lifestyles. Our attractive portfolio supports the increasing demand, putting us in a position of strength to capture opportunity as China transitions due to the next phase of recovery. While we don't expect a straight-line recovery, we are confident in our long-term opportunity. We look forward to serving our customers with the elevated experience only Starbucks can deliver.\nNow let me wrap up the segment performance with Channel Development. Our Starbucks brand and successful partnerships continue to fuel the success of our channel development business with revenues of over $480 million in the quarter, up 4% year-over-year. Our U.S. at-home coffee continues to resonate with customers as are winning the seasons with our well-received promotions and product launches. In terms of ready-to-drink, Starbucks has outgrown the category in sales growth, for 2 consecutive quarters and remain the #1 brand in the U.S. To continue this trend, we launched a much anticipated Pink drink and Paradise drink, which have already been met with overwhelming excitement.\nBefore I pass the call over to Rachel, I want to again extend my gratitude to our partners, our leadership team and to Howard for the significant progress we have made as a company this past year. I also want to reinforce my confidence in our reinvention, the work underway to refound our business, brand and culture and our position to fully realize the limitless potential of Starbucks.\nFor our long-term sustainable growth, we will look to discover ways to first further elevate the brand by getting the basics right, operating our stores well and with a beverage-forward food attached focus for renovation. Second, build on our leadership position in digital by scaling and introducing new and relevant customer experiences. Third, evolve to a more global presence for our business and for our brand. Fourth, work to become less wasteful and move with greater speed. And fifth, and critically reinvigorate our culture around what it means to be a partner at Starbucks. With a reinvention plan driving progress against our business goals, a contemporized mission and a brand differentiated human connection, our momentum is strengthening the business overall. Our focus on delivering elevated experiences will continue to set us apart.\nAs I look to close my remarks for the call, I want to reaffirm our guidance for the year, reflecting my optimism for our future even while recognizing we are operating in a challenging environment. I have great confidence in our leadership team and our partners as we carry on this journey together. We continue to build our plans for the medium to long term to recognize our limitless long-term growth potential. I could not be more excited, nor more grateful for the opportunity to build upon Starbucks' iconic legacy and shepherd in a new era for the company.\nWith that, I'll now turn it over to Rachel to discuss our Q2 fiscal year 2023 results in greater detail. Rachel?\n\nRachel Ruggeri\n\nExecutive VP, CFO & Principal Accounting Officer\n\nThank you, Laxman,, and welcome to your first Starbucks earnings call, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm so proud to discuss our outstanding Q2 performance, underscoring strength in both top line and margin globally. We delivered double-digit comp in all company-operated markets, excluding China, as well as positive comp in China driven by better-than-expected recovery and saw continued strength in our licensed markets. This momentum was made possible by the investments we are making in our stores and partners and allowed us to continue unlocking capital to reinvest in our business. As a result, our business and brand remains strong.\nAs we begin on this next step in our journey, I'm confident that our execution against our reinvention plan and broader strategies will progress us into our new era.\nOur Q2 consolidated revenues reached $8.7 billion, slightly above our Q1 level and up 14% from the prior year and up 17%, excluding more than 2 percentage impact of foreign currency translation. Revenue growth was primarily driven by 11% comparable stores sales growth, 6% net new company-operated store growth year-over-year as well as continued momentum in our global license to market. This is remarkable performance on every level, but specifically given the seasonality pressures we typically experience in Q2.",
        "content2": "Q2 consolidated operating margin expanded 130 basis points from the prior year to 14.3%, exceeding our expectations, primarily driven by sales leverage, including better-than-expected recovery in China, pricing, productivity improvement and lapping prior year COVID-related pay. The margin expansion was partially offset by investments in store partners, higher G&A costs in support of reinvention and inflation. Q2 EPS was $0.74, up 25% from the prior year. In addition to our strong global performance and better-than-expected recovery in China, this also includes an approximately $0.03 of onetime benefit from Starbucks Rewards redemption tier changes in North America, which reduced the related liabilities.\nI will now provide segment highlights for Q2. North America delivered revenue of $6.4 billion in Q2, another quarterly record and up 17% from the prior year. The growth was primarily driven by a 12% increase in comparable store sales consisting of 6% and 5% growth in transactions and average ticket, respectively, as well as net new company-operated store growth of 4% year-over-year, further strengthened by the continued momentum of our licensed store business.\nThe segment's outstanding performance was led by the U.S., posting 12% comp in Q2 with transaction and ticket equally contributing to the growth, also bolstered by lapping the Omicron variant of COVID in the prior year. Remarkably, store traffic has surpassed pre-pandemic levels in our busiest dayparts. And even with higher levels of beverage customization and complexity, we were able to serve the surge in traffic as we unlocked incremental store capacity through reinvention. Starbucks Rewards tender reached a record 57% of U.S. company-operated sales in the quarter showcasing customer loyalty and connection and indicating a successful launch of the changes to our redemption tiers.\nWe also continue to expand our store footprint across the U.S., reaching over 9,300 stores where stores opened in the last few years, driving nearly 50% cash-on-cash returns despite the inflationary environment. As part of our development strategy, we are committed to enhancing sustainability through greener stores with the program saving almost $60 million in annual operating costs in the U.S. alone through water savings and energy reduction when compared to historic store practices.\nOur runway of growth coupled with store-level cash returns and commitment to sustainability is exceptional for a company of our scale, contributing meaningfully to our robust capital position and ability to continue reinvesting in our business.\nU.S. licensed storage revenue sustained its momentum this quarter, up 25% from the prior year with strength across the portfolio and further supported by the rollout of Starbucks Connect as Laxman spoke about earlier, broadening our opportunity to reach our customers through our expanding network of stores. North America's operating margin was 19.2% in Q2, expanding 200 basis points from the prior year primarily driven by pricing, sales leverage, productivity improvement and lapping prior year COVID-related pay, partially offset by store partner investments and inflation. As you heard at the top of the call, we are already seeing our reinvention plan come to life, whether it's through improved partner turnover and engagement, a better customer experience or productivity, our amplifying efforts field margin growth in the quarter. a margin benefit of approximately 60 basis points was also captured in the quarter due to the reevaluation of our Starbucks Rewards liability, which will not occur in the balance of the year.\nMoving on to International. The segment delivered revenue of $1.9 billion in the quarter, also a Q2 record and up 9% from the prior year. When excluding a 10% impact from foreign currency translation, the segment's revenue grew 19%, reflecting double-digit growth in all major markets, including China. The growth was driven by strength across our licensed businesses, a 10% net new company-operated store growth year-over-year and a 7% increase in comparable store sales from transactions.\nOur international markets across the globe continue to demonstrate strong momentum. Excluding China, the segment's Q2 revenue grew 14% from the prior year or up 25% when excluding an 11% impact of foreign currency translation. Once again, our international markets, excluding China, collectively achieved double-digit comp growth, driven largely by transactions.\nLet me highlight the incredible performance of Japan this quarter, our third largest market globally, which surpassed 1,800 stores and delivered their eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit comp in Q2, as Laxman mentioned earlier.\nThe market also upleveled its Star Rewards program through introduction of a multi-tier redemption system designed to offer more customer choices and elevate the program economics. Subsequent to the quarter in April, Japan also became the third global market to introduce Oleato beverages, offering the innovative lineup at more than 60 of their select stores included the Starbucks Reserve Roastery Tokyo. While our performance in this market, a market that embraces innovation appears promising.\nShifting to China. China posted comp growth of 3% in Q2, meaningfully exceeding our expectations, including 30% comp growth in March as we began lapping heightened mobility restrictions in the prior year. From the early weeks of January, when China emerged from peak infections and mobility restrictions were lifted in different cities, we saw a broad-based recovery across all trade zones, dayparts and city tiers. This was fueled by a strong rebound in traffic as customers returned physically to our stores to enjoy moments of reconnection. Starbucks Rewards active members rebounded to 17.8 million by the end of Q2 and hit a new record high by the first week of Q3. The sharp immediate rebound in traffic demonstrated the strength of our brand and the relationships we have built with customers as well as our strong operating muscle to capture the pent-up demand all of which drove rapid improvement in average weekly sales in Q2.\nLooking ahead to the balance of the year, the speed of recovery in terms of average weekly sales will moderate after the faster-than-expected rebound achieved in Q2. For the remainder of the fiscal year, we will continue to face uncertainties such as changes in customer behaviors and the pace of international travel recovery as COVID in China enters a new endemic phase. Nevertheless, we feel confident Starbucks is well positioned for this next phase of recovery.\nOperating margin for the International segment was 17% in Q2, expanding 390 basis points from the prior year, mainly driven by sales leverage across markets, but specifically driven by the better-than-expected recovery in China partially offset by higher store partner wages and benefits.\nShifting to channel development. The segment's revenue grew 4% from the prior year to $481 million in Q2, in line with our expectations, driven primarily by growth in the Global Coffee Alliance. Global channel development extends customer occasions beyond our stores to amplify and diversify the Starbucks presence around the world. Our newer at-home platforms, including Starbucks Fine Espresso and Starbucks Creamers, continued to drive growth for the Global Coffee Alliance. We remain the market leader in global ready-to-drink categories with North America coffee partnership outgrowing the category and continuing to gain share for the past 2 quarters in a row.\nThe North American coffee partnership saw share gains across platforms, and we're excited about our robust pipeline of innovations. To name a few, we launched Frappuccino mini cans in late March to bring a perfect size treat to our consumers. We're also elevating our portfolio with bottled Starbucks Pink Drink and Starbucks Paradise Drink, which were inspired by popular handcrafted beverages in our stores and just hit store shelves in April. The segment's operating margin was 35.6% in Q2, down 710 basis points from the prior year, primarily due to impairment charges against certain manufacturing assets and mix shift. Excluding the impairment, the segment's margin was nearly 40% for the quarter, and we continue to expect channel development's margin to normalize in the mid-40s range towards the end of the year.\nNow moving on to our guidance for fiscal 2023. As Laxman discussed, we are reaffirming our guidance for the fiscal year, balancing our incredible momentum and optimism with the economic uncertainties we continue to face around the world. Let me provide some additional insights on our outlook. First, in the U.S., a meaningful part of the 12% comp in the quarter reflected a lap of Omicron in the earlier part of the quarter which was incorporated into our original guidance for Q2. U.S. comp has normalized as anticipated in March and into Q3 with expected annual comp continuing to be in the guidance range of 7% to 9%. Second, similar to comp, our Q2 North America margin also benefited from lapping a sizable amount of COVID pay in relation to Omicron accounting for 120 basis points of year-over-year expansion as well as Starbucks Rewards tier change impact of 60 basis points, which are not expected to recur in the balance of the year.\nThird, as I discussed earlier, we expect China's average weekly sales to sequentially grow in Q3 and Q4, but at a more moderate pace. Acknowledging the uncertain environment we expect China comp to improve in the back half of the year, driven in large part by the lap of mobility restrictions in Q3 of the prior year, coupled with the continued recovery, leading to low to mid-single-digit comp on a full year basis.\nLastly, although China's Q2 margin was also stronger than expected, it benefited from the timing of certain investments. As we continue to ramp our operations in the balance of the year, we plan to resume investments required to drive sustainable growth over the long term. Further, here are some points of clarification on guidance. Regarding the shape of margin, we continue to expect sequential margin improvement in both Q3 and Q4. We expect Q3 margin near the prior year level with Q4 expanding meaningfully over prior year as we lap the significant investments in wages and benefits. Note the quarterly margin shape in Q3 and Q4 is not expected to mirror the prior year. We also expect EPS to step up in the second half of the fiscal year, improving sequentially in Q3 and Q4. We expect year-over-year EPS growth in Q3 to be meaningfully lower than our fiscal year guidance range of 15% to 20% with Q4 year-over-year EPS growth slightly above the high end of our guidance range. Our guidance continues to include the impacts of significant investments related to our reinvention plan as well as inflationary pressures, which are moderating. We continue to expect our G&A growth to be outsized in fiscal year 2023. A large portion of the G&A growth will reflect critical technology investments, which we believe will fuel our reinvention and business growth. Importantly, as we conclude the first half of the fiscal year, our global performance is closely tracking to our original expectations as the significant unexpected headwinds in China were offset by strong performance in the U.S. and the rest of the world. While we continue to navigate our path to recovery in China, coupled with the heightened level of macro uncertainty around the world, we are confident that the reinvention investments we are making in our partners, stores and customers will continue to guide our growth, delivering on our original fiscal 2023 outlook.\nLastly, despite the current interest rate environment, our balance sheet remains very healthy supported by our strong cash flows and a measured financial policy targeting leverage below 3x lease-adjusted debt to EBITDA. We are in an enviable position to continue to invest in our business, deliver on our shareholder return commitments and retain financial flexibility in the face of current economic uncertainty.\nIn summary, here are key takeaways for my discussion today. One, our global business and brand remains strong, demonstrated by both top line and margin performance in Q2. We are brewing on all cylinders across our building blocks of growth, namely strong comp, propelled by digital engagement, unrivaled innovation and engaged partners, store growth anchored by best-in-class cash returns and margin uplifted by reinvention as it continues to gain traction. Two, our fiscal year guidance remains unchanged, balancing our optimism with the economic uncertainties around the world. And finally, our new era is coming to life as we continue unlocking capacity and driving capital returns through reinvention. The investments being fused into our business is centering us on our core while increasing differentiation and building resiliency to help us realize our limitless future.\nBefore I close, I want to express my deep appreciation for our partners around the world, especially our Green Apron partners for the critical role they played in achieving our success this quarter, our future rests on the shoulders of many, and it's our collective unwavering commitment to serve our partners, customers and all of those from farm to cup in the best way possible to allow Starbucks to deliver on our limitless possibilities.\nWith that, we will open the call to Q&A.

Now before I turn the call over, let me first say thank you to Howard. Because in our short amount of time together, I have witnessed a relentless focus on our culture while not compromising results. You have reinforced the importance of dreaming bigger than others may even think is possible. And for that, I will forever be grateful. And so now the floor is yours, Howard.\n\nHoward D. Schultz\n\nFounder, Interim CEO & Director, Starbucks Corporation\n\nThank you, Tiffany. I did not expect that. Thank you very much. Good afternoon, and welcome, everyone. I'm pleased to comment on the strong financial and operating results Starbucks reported today, highlighted by record quarterly sales of $8.7 billion, up 8% over last year, up 12%, excluding foreign exchange, a stunning 10% comp growth in the U.S. and North America, 5% comp growth globally. And except for China, very strong sales and comp growth in every international market we are in.\nWe posted strong results despite challenging global consumer and inflationary environments, a softer quarter for retail overall and an unprecedented COVID-related headwinds that unfolded in China. Credit belongs to our partners around the world, who continue to successfully satisfy record demand in our stores while delivering an elevated Starbucks Experience to our customers. In China, COVID-related mobility restrictions and a spike in COVID infections following the end of zero COVID resulted in comp sales of minus 29% for the quarter, 4x worse than what we expected.\nWeak sales combined with the cost to support the health, the safety and well-being of our partners, our first priority, negatively impacted total company earnings by $0.06, resulting in Q1 EPS of $0.75 per share. Despite short-term headwinds, we are confident that the end of zero COVID marks the beginning of China's emergence from 3 years of pandemic, puts the country on a path to reintroducing normalcy and routine back into people's lives and positions the country to resume pre-COVID levels of consumer, social and economic growth.\nWe also believe that the end of zero COVID will enable renewed consumer activity in China and recovery of our business in the back half of fiscal 2023. Our view is informed by patterns of post-COVID behaviors we have seen in countries around the world as consumer activity accelerates as years of pent-up demand is released. Today, our stores in China are again open without restriction and our partners are back at work. Many have been infected and recovered from COVID.\nNoteworthy is that we saw a meaningful sequential improvement in sales and traffic as we move through January as people began resuming aspects of their pre-COVID lives, including gradually returning to our stores. More on China shortly. Our performance in Q1 underscores the success of the investments we are making in our people in extending our global leadership around everything coffee and in relevant innovation that, together, are driving sales and transaction growth around the world.\nStarbucks is more relevant globally today than ever before in our history, ideally positioning us to successfully execute our ambitious growth agenda and have roughly 45,000 stores delivering best-in-class returns around the world by the end of fiscal 2025. On today's call, I will highlight the drivers of our performance in Q1 and provide an update on the progress of our reinvention initiatives.\nI will then provide granular details specifically around the shape of our business in China and shine a bright light on the positive correlation between increases in consumer activity in China and the recovery of our business. Next, Brady will detail the beverage, food, mobile, digital and store innovation that drove record demand for Starbucks Coffee in every market outside of China in Q1. And he will speak to our record holiday performance, the strong growth in U.S. Starbucks Rewards membership sequentially and year-over-year and the extraordinary record of $3.3 billion loaded on cards and gifted in the U.S.\nWe entered Q1 with roughly $2 billion globally waiting to be spent in our stores, increased Starbucks Rewards membership and card loads serve as both a current annuity and the future driver of our business. And then finally, Rachel will highlight our Q1 financial and operating performance and speak to the confidence we have in our full year 2023 guidance despite the significant impact from China, and we'll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.\nLet me begin with North America. The record demand for Starbucks Coffee in North America we've reported on our Q4 call accelerated in Q1 and through holiday. Despite the difficult operating environment that most retailers, particularly brick-and-mortar retailers experienced in the quarter. Average weekly sales in the U.S. company-operated stores reached a record high in Q1, exceeding the prior record set in Q4 of fiscal '22.\nThis is -- this next line, I think, is just -- even when I read it, I'm surprised, with 8 of the 10 highest sales days in our history recorded in the quarter. Consistently strong demand drove revenues up 14% to a quarterly record of $6.6 billion and a comp sale of 10% over last year. And Q1 momentum has continued in Q2. Active Starbucks Rewards membership in the U.S., exiting Q1, totaled over 30 million members, up 4 million members or 15% over last year and up 6% sequentially.\nLoyal Starbucks Reward members drove a record 56% of tender, up 3% from last year, reflecting increased customer engagement throughout our system. Our convenience channels, Mobile Order & Pay, drive-through and delivery continue to fuel our business, delivering 72% of U.S. revenue in Q1. We continue to add high returning drive-throughs that attract new customers, expand our footprint and drive new customer occasions. Our over 6,600 store U.S. license business posted similar strong results with 32% revenue growth and double-digit comps across all operating segments.\nWhat's interesting to me is while grocery retailers are representative segment, within our licensed business, experienced traffic and spend-related headwinds across their store base in Q1, their Starbucks business proved to be the bright spot, bringing incremental traffic into their stores and driving sales for us as well. We continued to roll out Starbucks Connect, enabling licensed stores to offer all Starbucks Mobile Order & Pay and Rewards benefits, expanding the value offering we provide our customers and licensees and enabling us to capture demand across our broader store portfolio. Starbucks Connect is proving to be highly incremental, and we see great upside for it.\nCross-functional teams continue to successfully execute against our reinvention initiatives and our reinvention investments are having a measurable positive impact on our business, evidenced by an 8% improvement in U.S. hourly retail partner turnover. Improved turnover correlates to more stable store environments, elimination of new hire-related costs, particularly training, and measurable improvements in productivity, speed of service and partner and customer experience scores that we're already seeing.\nOur Q1 performance demonstrates that our reinvention plan investments are the right investments that we are making and are delivering results and creating shareholder value, providing us with tremendous confidence in the revenue, margin and EPS expectations that we shared at our Investor Day. Let me turn to international. Outside of China, the momentum we saw in our International segment exiting Q4 continued in Q1. Excluding China and foreign currency translation, revenues for the quarter are up 25% and comps were up 11%, fueled by recovery consumption in Japan and a rebound in tourism activity across our EMEA markets, following the lift of COVID restrictions.\nOne great example is Alshaya. Alshaya is our license partner in the Middle East for the last 23 years and among our largest international licensees with over 1,800 stores across 13 markets. They reported their strongest quarter with the Starbucks brand ever in Q1. We added 370 new stores in international in Q1 and now operate 18,700 stores across 84 markets, 43% company-operated and 57% licensed.\nStrong growth in our international license business reflects the outside returns the Starbucks brand delivers to our licensees, driving increased investment by our licensees in our business and growing customer engagement with our Starbucks brand around the world.\nTurning to channel development. The Starbucks brand relevant innovation and seasonal moments are resonating with our customers and driving sales and occasions around the world, resulting in a 15% increase in channel revenues in Q1 over last year to $478 million.\nWe continue to hold the #1 dollar share in U.S. at-home coffee and in Q1 outpaced dollar sales growth in North America ready-to-drink category overall, again demonstrating the unique power of the Starbucks brand. In China, Starbucks received the ready-to-drink New Product Launch of the Year award for the introduction of Bottled Frappuccino oat latte.\nWe will continue to delight our customers with exciting new beverage innovation in the months ahead, including with the launch of Starbucks ready-to-drink Pink Drink inspired by the overwhelming success of Pink Drinks served in our retail stores and certain to become a customer favorite, especially with our young customers and our Gen Z audience.\nLet me begin the discussion around China by saying that Starbucks has been in China now for over 24 years, and that our confidence in the future of Starbucks business in China and our aspirations for the market and our partners has never been greater. We exited Q1 with almost 6,100 Starbucks stores across 240 cities, and our newest class of stores continue despite the challenges we've had to achieve best-in-class returns and profitability.\nAnd we remain on plan to have 9,000 stores in China by the end of 2025. Our belief in China is based on our leadership position in the market, our relationship with our partners and the trust that we have among our Chinese customers and the market and our brand position.\nSince 2020, our Starbucks China team has been navigating the most acute COVID-related mobility restrictions and disruptions anywhere in the world, while at the same time, developing the flexibility to execute under any COVID scenario. By leading in together, in service of their customers and fellow partners, our China team has navigated every challenge obstacle and volatility that COVID had put in their way, building more capability, flexibility and operating muscle with each unexpected test.\nThat flexibility and operating muscle, coupled with deliberate investments that we've made throughout the pandemic, supported our business in Q1 and will increasingly drive efficiency, productivity, profitability and shareholder value, and enable us to deliver an even more relevant and elevated Starbucks experience to our partners and our customers in the years ahead.\nAs I shared on our last call, our recovery in China gained momentum in Q4 of 2022 despite severe mobility restrictions in many of our larger cities. We saw sequential improvement in all key operating metrics driven by the success of mobile and digital technology investments and expanded delivery capabilities built during COVID that made it easier for our customers to engage with us and better enable us to serve them. The direct positive correlation we saw between increased consumer activity in China and sales in our stores and the speed and consistency with which our business was accelerating, gave us great confidence moving through the quarter.\nHowever, in September, a new wave of COVID spiked resulting in further increased mobility restrictions, new mobile, digital and delivery capabilities enabled us to partially offset the reduction in store traffic in September. However, in early December, zero COVID was lifted and COVID infection spiked across China, resulting in a dramatic decline in consumer activity across the country and causing the most severe COVID disruptions any retailer had encountered.\nFor us, at its peak, nearly 1,800 Starbucks stores were closed during that month. As a result, comps in Q1 declined 29% with a 42% comp decline in December alone. But like consumers everywhere, our customers in China are creating a full return to familiar pre-COVID routines and lifestyles. And huge consumer demand in China is waiting to be unleashed. Early indications are that it is beginning to happen in our largest cities now with many Chinese recovered from COVID, people returning to work, border and travel restrictions lifted, mall traffic and retail store activity on the rise and consumers reintroducing social activity back into their daily lives.\nWe saw the strongest level of sustained customer activity we've seen in years in the run-up to and during Chinese New Year festivities. As Rachel will share, we are expecting the second half of fiscal 2023 in China to be stronger than the first half. But uncertainties remain and the better part of valor is to remain cautious around precisely when our recovery in China will take full flight. However, when it does, pattern recognition, the return on pre-COVID routines and the adoption of new post-COVID routines will become self-evident in China. And customers will flock to Starbucks stores to enjoy moments of reconnection, their favorite Starbucks beverages and the premium Starbucks experience our partners in China deliver. And Q1 headwinds will shift to tailwinds. We've seen this pattern repeat in markets around the world, including the United States.\nDespite the challenges and the uncertainties of the last 3 years, Starbucks' commitment to China and to our partners and business in China has never wavered. Almost 25 years after entering the market, I remain more confident than ever that we are still only in the early chapters of our growth story in China. And I'm looking forward to being with our China partners for the first time in years when I visit the country this spring.\nLaxman's immersion continues to go spectacularly well. He and I engage daily as he absorbs more about our company and business and wins the hearts and minds of Starbucks partners everywhere. Only weeks from now, Lax will take full control of the company and, together with our leadership team, bring reinvention to life, guide Starbucks into a new era of growth and begin writing the next chapters of our storied history. I cannot be more confident that Lax is the right CEO at the right time for Starbucks.\nAnd Starbucks Coffee Company domestically and around the world is in great hands with him as the CEO. This, my last earnings call, is very special for me and a powerful emotional reminder of the intersection of my life at Starbucks.\nIt was 1983, walking the beautiful streets of Milan that the inspiration for what Starbucks could one day be and mean first struck me. 40 years later, I'm not sure where the years have gone. 40 years later, we have over 36,000 stores around the world, serving over 100 million customers each week. Along the way, we have created opportunity, cared for and improve the lives of millions of Starbucks partners and made progress against my goal of creating a different kind of company, a company steeped in humanity, humility and respect, where everyone is welcome, and we embrace the belief that our differences make us better and stronger.\nAnd a company unlike any company my father ever got a chance to work for, but there's much more opportunity and much more work ahead. Finally, while Starbucks has launched many successful coffee beverages over the years, my Starbucks journey will come full circle when I return to Milan later this month to introduce something much bigger than any new promotion or beverage. While I was in Italy last summer, I discovered an enduring, transformative new category and platform for the company, unlike anything I had ever experienced.\nThe word I would use to describe it without giving too much away is alchemy. We won't unveil details today, but it will be a game changer, so standby. Many people have asked me if my final earnings call as Starbucks CEO is bitter sweet, it really isn't. Starbucks business and brand, the quality of our coffee, the relevance of the Starbucks partner and customer experiences have defined us since our founding in 1971 and have never been better or stronger.\nAnd our future has never been brighter. It will be my pleasure to take a front-row seat as Laxman leads Starbucks into and through the exciting new era of growth ahead. With that, I'll turn the call over to Brady.\n\nBrady Brewer\n\nExecutive VP & CMO, Starbucks Corporation\n\nThank you, Howard. I know I speak for so many when I say thank you for your relentless pursuit of elevating the Starbucks customer and partner experience. Your leadership to our reinvention has us well positioned to continue advancing towards our biggest aspirations with Laxman and our strengthened leadership team.\nGood afternoon, everyone. I'm incredibly proud of our strong Q1 performance across all markets. Today, I'll focus on what we saw in the U.S. this quarter. In addition to the strong customer demand for Starbucks overall, our results benefited from last year's strategic pricing actions and increased food attached with record sales for both Sous Vide Egg Bites and breakfast sandwiches.\nOur product portfolio and innovations continue to resonate with customers, especially our cold, customized beverage innovation. Beverage sales increased 13%, led by our strength in the espresso category, with featured holiday beverages like the Caramel BrulÃ©e Latte and Sugar Cookie Almondmilk Latte contributing to growth. Customized beverages continue to be a differentiator with customers all year long. Modifier sales were up 28% year-over-year in our U.S. company-operated stores, showing that customers are visiting Starbucks for beverages customized to their preferences that they cannot find anywhere else.\nThe strength and relevance of the Starbucks brand continued to accelerate this holiday season as we surpassed, as Howard said, 30 million active Starbucks Rewards members. We drove record-breaking mobile order usage at 27% of transactions in the U.S. company-operated stores, and we reached an all-time high in the population of our weekly total active customer base. We also saw more than $3.3 billion loaded on Starbucks cards in the U.S., exceeding last year's record results and setting a new record.\nIn fact, our gifting business was so strong that the unit sales of Starbucks Cards were greater than the next 4 brands of gift cards combined. This not only drives new Starbucks Rewards registrations but it also drives our business in Q2 as evidenced by the high 56% Starbucks Reward tender that we saw in our U.S. company-operated stores at the end of the quarter. Said another way, during the holiday season, Starbucks truly becomes the currency of kindness and it drives our business.\nAt the heart of Starbucks is uplifting human connection. This is a core part of our reinvention, and we accelerated our reinvention investments in the quarter, driving continued improvement in our industry-leading partner retention. We're also committed to elevating the customer experience. And within the quarter, we launched our first Starbucks Rewards, Reward Together partnership with Delta Airlines, which offers members of both Delta SkyMiles and Starbucks Rewards, new ways to earn rewards.\nOn December 8, we also launched the Starbucks Rewards Odyssey experience in beta to select members. Odyssey members have been invited to partake in multiple Odyssey journeys, driving increased engagement and loyalty from our members and now ownership in their loyalty experience. We also announced the national expansion of our partnership with DoorDash, which, alongside Uber Eats, also provides us the ability to serve customers in a convenient way and enjoy Starbucks wherever they are. And we announced changes to our Starbucks Rewards redemption tiers, which not only supports critical program growth and discount efficiencies, but it also allows us to add increasing value relevant to our members by making popular items like cold coffee, more attainable, a change that our members have praised.\nFinally, we're furthering the value delivered to our SR members by bringing them coffeehouse culture and content through a new series in the Starbucks app called the Starbucks daily, which will launch with [iHeart Radio] this month. In short, Starbucks is an incredibly strong brand and one that is poised for growth. I'll now turn it over to Rachel.\n\nRachel Ruggeri\n\nExecutive VP, CFO & Principal Accounting Officer, Starbucks Corporation\n\nThank you, Brady, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me begin by saying that I am very proud of what we achieved in Q1 with nearly every business contributing to our strong performance. The remarkable strength in nearly all major markets and channels across the globe led to outperformance across our metrics when excluding the headwinds in China. Our Q1 consolidated revenues of $8.7 billion were another record quarterly high, up 8% from the prior year or 12% when excluding an approximately 3% impact of foreign currency translation.\nThe revenue growth was primarily driven by 5% comparable store sales growth; 5% net new store growth over the past 12 months; impressive momentum in our U.S. and international licensed stores as well as our channel development businesses. When excluding China and the impact from foreign currency translation, revenues in all 3 of our reporting segments continued to expand double digit, demonstrating the demand of our diverse portfolio and power of our innovation as we focus on our new era of growth.",
        "content2": "Q1 consolidated operating margin contracted 60 basis points from the prior year to 14.5%, primarily driven by investments in growth in labor, part of which represent the reinvention plan, inflation and deleverage in China. The contraction was partially offset by pricing in North America and sales leverage across markets outside of China. The deleverage in China was more significant than expected, while other margin drivers were largely in line with our original guidance.\nQ1 EPS was $0.75, up 4% from the prior year, including an approximate $0.06 dilutive impact from the headwinds in China relative to our original expectations. Although we anticipated China's recovery to be nonlinear, the headwinds in Q1 were larger than our prior estimate by approximately $0.06 due to the unforeseen changes in COVID restriction and infection spikes. The significant strength across our global portfolio, however, largely offset the impacts from China's performance, keeping us on track to achieve our fiscal 2023 growth targets, as I'll discuss in a moment.\nFirst, I'll provide segment highlights for Q1. North America delivered another quarter of all-time record revenue in Q1 of $6.6 billion, up 14% from the prior year, primarily driven by a 10% increase in comparable store sales, inclusive of a 9% increase in average ticket, net new store growth of 3% over the past 12 months and very strong growth in our U.S. licensed store business. Our U.S. company-operated stores had a record revenue quarter with 10% comp growth in Q1, fueled by strength in digital, innovation and record holiday performance as both Howard and Brady shared. In addition to the continued strength in ticket, the number of unique customers grew 10%, setting another all-time record and further expanding our reach.\nLet me also highlight the very strong performance of U.S. licensed stores this quarter, which posted revenue growth in excess of 30% and 15% system comp growth over the prior year Q1 with strength across the portfolio. Performance was particularly strong in retail and travel as pre-COVID behavior normalcy returns, with U.S. licensed store revenue indexing at roughly 140% of pre-pandemic levels.\nGrocery also experienced strong growth, powered by the continued rollout of Starbucks Connect despite the overall decline in customer traffic across the rest of grocery store industry. North America's operating margin was 18.6% in Q1, contracting 20 basis points from the prior year, primarily due to previously committed investments in labor, including enhanced store partner wages and benefits as well as inflationary headwinds, partially offset by pricing and sales leverage.\nWhile Q1 operating margin declined sequentially from Q4 fiscal 2022, driven primarily by seasonal sales mix shift, we gained productivity through reinvention, including improved partner retention and equipment rollouts, paving the way for progressive margin expansion in the latter half of fiscal 2023 and years to come.\nMoving to international. The segment delivered revenue of $1.7 billion in Q1, down 10% from the prior year or up 2% when excluding a nearly 13% unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. The revenue growth was driven by sustained momentum across all major markets outside of China as well as an 8% increase in total store count over the past 12 months.\nThe growth was partially offset by a 13% decline in comparable store sales, including a 29% decline in China. Although China posted a comp decline of 29% in Q1, the heaviest decline of 42% was experienced in December with pressure carrying into Q2, all of which was well below our original estimates, as mentioned in my opening. Just to give you a little color, at its peak, nearly 1,800 stores or close to 30% of our portfolio were temporarily closed due to sharp fall in traffic and labor shortage because of partners falling sick to COVID.\nOutside of China and excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, our diverse international markets across the globe continued to outperform in Q1. Once again, these markets, together, achieved double-digit comp growth, driven primarily by transactions. Their revenue grew 25% in the quarter when excluding a 17% unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation with successful holiday campaigns across all regions. Operating margins for the International segment was 14.3% in Q1, down 400 basis points from the prior year, mainly driven by deleverage in China, but partially offset by strong sales leverage across other global markets and the resulting business mix.\nShifting to channel development. The segment's revenue grew 15% to $478 million in Q1, driven by double-digit growth in both the Global Coffee Alliance and our global ready-to-drink businesses. Within the Global Coffee Alliance, newer platforms continue to be key drivers of growth, including Starbucks Blonde Espresso and Starbucks Creamers. Our ready-to-drink lineups are fueled by core platforms in our international markets and robust innovations in the pipeline.\nSustainability was also top of mind for the segment, trailblazing, recyclable, multiserve iced coffee bottle made from recyclable plastic. The segment's operating margin was 47.4% in Q1, up 350 basis points from the prior year, primarily driven by strength in our North American coffee partnership joint venture income. Now moving to our guidance for fiscal 2023. Let me take a few minutes to go deeper on the implications to our business from the challenges we're facing in China.\nIn January, China's comparable sales growth was a decline of approximately 15%, which was an improvement from a decline of 42% in December. While we're seeing early positive signs of momentum rebuilding, headwinds related to COVID still exist in the market and are expected to impact the full Q2. As a result, we anticipate the negative impact on the operating income in Q2 to be comparable to or greater than Q1.\nAlthough we previously projected China recovery as early as Q3 of this fiscal year, we do not have clear line of sight into the timing of recovery and believe China's contribution as a percentage of our fiscal 2023 consolidated operating income to be lower than our original guidance assumed. However, our long-term opportunity in China is very strong.\nWe expect the market to see meaningful sales rebound once recovery is in full swing. Until then, we continue to stay focused on the long-term growth opportunities that China will deliver while weathering the short-term and transitory challenges. Now even with that backdrop and taking into account the uncertainty of China's recovery timing, our fiscal 2023 guidance remains unchanged. As a few point of clarification on guidance, in China, we now expect negative comps to continue through the second quarter, followed by improvement in the balance of the year.\nAnother point of clarification is that China store growth remains unchanged as we execute our strategy to expand in new cities. Also, our guidance continues to include the impacts of significant investments related to our reinvention plan and inflationary pressures which largely remain comparable to what we had originally anticipated. Lastly, our guidance reflects the latest projection of foreign currency translation with approximate 2 and 3 percentage point unfavorable impact on fiscal 2023 revenue and earnings growth, respectively. This reflects an improvement of approximately 1 percentage point on both revenue and earnings growth relative to our previous expectations.\nAdditionally, in terms of quarterly shape, operating margin is expected to decline sequentially in Q2, near prior year level, driven primarily by the COVID-related headwinds in China. We still expect margins to expand in the back half of the year, improving sequentially in Q3 and Q4 as sales leverage, pricing, productivity gains from reinvention as well as recovery in China begin to contribute to positive margin expansion as the year progresses. We continue to expect quarterly EPS shape to roughly mirror the shape of operating margin with a sequential decline in Q2 and a meaningful step up in the second half of the fiscal year.\nLastly, we also remain committed to returning approximately $20 billion to shareholders by the end of fiscal 2025 between share repurchases and dividends. Our repurchase program resumed in Q1 of this fiscal year and will accelerate as reinvention gains ground. Since the inception of our dividend program, 51 quarters ago, our annual dividend growth has averaged greater than 20%, and our dividend payout rates near the top percentile of growth companies of our size and our scale, which is an exceptional complement to our long-term EPS growth target as high as 15% to 20%.\nIn summary, here are key takeaways for my discussion today. First, our business and our brand are strong and strengthening every day as demonstrated by the record sales in Q1. Next, our Q1 performance serves as proof point that we are progressing nicely against our strategy, inclusive of our reinvention plan and delivering the results we projected. And finally, we will continue to innovate in the critical areas of digital, product and stores as our new era of growth is just beginning to unlock, and we are excited about what lies ahead, including welcoming Laxman as CEO this spring and on our second quarterly earnings call.\nNow before I close, I want to express my sincere gratitude for the hard work of our Starbucks Green Apron partners across the globe, including those in China who serve our customers in a way that only Starbucks knows how. Also, with this being Howard's last earnings call, I would be remiss if I didn't take a moment to thank Howard for his vision to create a company that is truly different, where value is created for all.\nI know that I speak for many of us when I say we will honor your legacy while taking the company to the next level, all in making you, our partners and our shareholders proud. With that, we'll open the call to Q&A.\nOperator?"

Schultz\n\nFounder & Director, Starbucks Corporation\n\nThank you, Tiffany. Well, hello from Milan. Today has been a very special day for me and a powerful emotional reminder of the intersection of my life and years with Starbucks. It was 40 years ago, walking the beautiful streets of Milan, that the inspiration for the possibilities of what Starbucks could one day be and mean around the world first struck me.\nAnd here I am, back in Milan, celebrating the early days of our beautiful, thriving business in Italy, a country in which no one expected Starbucks to succeed, on the very day of our global launch of holiday, an event that has become a phenomenon all over the world.\nSo much of Starbucks' inspiration has come from Italy. And in Italy, our partner's dedication to the art of coffee, to the elegance and passion of coffee craft and to the delivery of a premium coffee experience to our customers, is being executed at the highest level. Italians have embraced Starbucks. Our top-selling beverage is actually a solo espresso, validating the quality of our coffee and the relevance of Starbucks customer experience that has defined us since Starbucks' founding in 1971.\nWe recently opened our 20th store in Verona to record crowds, with Rome and Naples fast following in 2023. Milan and Italy are reflections of the premium coffee experience Starbucks is delivering to customers in cities and countries everywhere as demonstrated by the very strong Q4 and fiscal 2022 financial and operating performance Starbucks reported this afternoon.\nIn Q4, Starbucks grew global revenues 11% over prior year to a quarterly record of $8.4 billion driven by 7% comp growth globally and 11% comp growth in North America. For the fiscal year, we grew global revenues 13% over prior year to a record $32.3 billion driven by 8% comp growth globally and 12% comp growth in North America. We also grew our global store base 6% in fiscal '22 and ended the year with roughly 36,000 stores in 83 countries.\nToday, Starbucks serves over 100 million customer occasions from our retail stores around the world and across all channels, delivers over 400 million customer coffee occasions globally every week.\nWe continue to manage the business through today's challenging operating environment, more mindful than ever of the unprecedented global economic uncertainties and challenges confronting our customers. Our strong performance in the quarter and year is particularly gratifying, in that it underscores the relevance of the Starbucks brand and the strength of our relationships with our customers around the world in the face of these unprecedented challenges.\nWe saw strong demand for Starbucks coffee in Q4 and throughout the year in every market and channel in which we operate. We are encouraged by the early signs of recovery we saw in China in Q4, where innovation, increased customer physical and digital engagement with the Starbucks brand and the relaxing of COVID restrictions, drove solid positive sales momentum and sequential quarterly improvement.\nThe speed with which our business in China accelerated in Q4 and the strong positive correlation between Starbucks revenue growth and the relaxing of COVID mobility restriction reinforces our confidence in Starbucks' long-term growth opportunity in China.\nHowever, as you know, over the past few weeks, there has been a significant resurgence of COVID in China. With the resurgence has come renewed lockdowns and mobility restrictions pursuant to China's strict zero-COVID policy, including in many cities in which we operate, meaningfully reducing traffic in our stores. We anticipate the current COVID-related uncertainty to continue and repeat the view we shared on our Q3 call and our Investor Day, that while our long-term aspirations for China remain undiminished, we expect the recovery of our business in the country to be nonlinear. I'll spend more time on China in a few minutes.\nIn fiscal 2022, we drove meaningful growth in our global customer base. In the U.S. alone, we grew our unique customers 9% year-over-year, and our U.S. customers are engaging more deeply with the Starbucks brand as evidenced by a 16% increase in U.S. Starbucks Rewards membership year-over-year to nearly 29 million members, up 5% over Q3. Today, Starbucks is connecting to more customers more deeply, both in the U.S. and around the world, than ever before, ideally positioning us to drive further acceleration in revenues and comps in the quarters and years ahead.\nOur performance supports our confidence in the ambitious growth agenda we announced in September, in which we will be adding roughly 8 new stores per day, delivering best-in-class returns around the world every day for the next 3 years, bringing us to nearly 45,000 stores globally by the end of fiscal 2025.\nOur Q4 results also demonstrate evidence of early but highly encouraging benefits from reinvention plan investments we detailed at Investor Day in September. And as you will hear from Frank Britt, our Chief Strategy and Transformation Officer, we have clear line of sight to a full array of benefits reinvention will deliver in the quarters and years ahead.\nFollowing Frank, Sara Trilling, a 20-year Starbucks partner, who recently took over leadership of our North American business after having successfully led Asia Pacific for the last 4 years, she will provide insights into our business in North America today and what to expect in the quarters ahead. Then Rachel will highlight our financial and operating performance in Q4 and for the year and provide guidance for the year ahead. And finally, we will end the call with Q&A.\nWhen fully rolled out, Starbucks' reinvention, co-created in partnership with our partners across the country, will touch and elevate every aspect of our Starbucks partner, customer and store experiences. Last week, 2,000 Starbucks leaders from across U.S. and Canada converged in Seattle to coalesce around reinvention and take it back to their local markets. I don't think I've ever seen greater engagement in over 40 years of a more positive response to any Starbucks gathering in our history.\nReinvention investments will make it easier for our partners to do their jobs, better enable partners to satisfy growing demand in our stores and provide greater opportunity for our partners to engage with our customers. Reinvention investments are already having a measurable positive impact on our business and operations, most notably in terms of improved partner retention, increased speed of service and an elevated customer experience. And I'm particularly pleased that reinvention investments are bringing coffee excellence, coffee craft and joy and a little bit of love back into being a Starbucks Barista.\nKey to Starbucks' success and the foundation of our long-term growth strategy is Starbucks' continued global leadership around all things coffee and espresso, hot and cold, Starbucks' core. In Q4, we continued to grow from our core, innovate, introduce new levels of customization and premiumization and extend our global coffee leadership in both the hot and cold beverage categories, with an emphasis on cold coffee, a category we single-handedly created and are growing around the world.\nCustomer demand for customized, handcrafted Starbucks cold beverages is so strong that, today, cold coffee beverages account for 76% of total beverage sales in our U.S. company-operated stores. And customers are increasingly further customizing their cold coffee beverages by adding high-margin beverage flavor modifiers to create unique beverages tailored to their own particular taste preferences.\nWe also continue to introduce innovative new core hot coffee and espresso beverages and innovate around iconic platforms, like pumpkin spice, up 17% over last year driven by increased customization, including cold foams. As part of reinvention, we are rolling out a new, completely proprietary, handheld cold foamer that enhances beverage quality and increases speed of service while reducing complexity for our partners. The response from our partners has been overwhelming.\nOur growing base of new U.S. customers and Starbucks Rewards members, combined with very strong customer response to our innovative hot and cold beverage lineup to deliver the highest net sales week in our history in September. Let me just repeat that. In our history, we had the biggest sales week in September. The strength of our business as we exited September, coupled with a fantastic holiday lineup kicking off today, with our stores turning red, holiday favorites on the menu and the return of our iconic red cups, gives us tremendous confidence heading into holiday in 2023.\nIn North America overall, the combination of customer shifts towards premium hot and cold beverages, increased customization, strategic decisions around beverage, food and modifier pricing and an 18% increase in food sales drove net revenues up 15% year-over-year to a record $6.1 billion.\nOnce again, our convenience channels, drive-through, Mobile Order & Pay and delivery drove 72% of our total sales volume. Starbucks Rewards members drove a record 55% of tender in our U.S. company-operated stores in Q4. Starbucks Rewards continues to deliver value to our customers, enable customer connection and drive our business. And despite its global scale and growth, we have significant untapped opportunities to grow our Rewards program in a very unique way.\nWe recently launched our Reward Together program, enabling a select group of leading brands to partner with us by linking their loyalty program to Starbucks Rewards. Through Reward Together, we will engage and reward members of both brands with new benefits and experiences that will make our Rewards program even more valuable, drive membership and increase customer lifetime value.\nOur first U.S. partnership with Delta Airlines launched last month to an extraordinary customer response. Both Delta and Starbucks were overwhelmed with what took place. And in September, we announced Starbucks Odyssey, our next-generation loyalty model that integrates NFTs with Rewards. Starbucks Odyssey will enable us to connect even more deeply with customers and give our customers the opportunity to earn and purchase digital collectible assets that will unlock access to new benefits, a digital community and immersive coffee experiences that they cannot get in any other place.\nCustomer response to Starbucks Odyssey has been overwhelming. You will hear more about the Starbucks Odyssey in a few weeks when our first wave of customers have an opportunity to explore this new exciting way to experience and connect with Starbucks. The numbers that we will release in terms of the response will surprise many of you.\nOur fast-growing 6,600 North American-licensed store business posted very strong results in Q4, with revenues up 25% in Q4 and 29% for the year. We are proceeding with the rollout of [Starbucks Connect] across the U.S. licensed store portfolio. Starbucks Connect enables licensed stores for the first time to offer the full array of Starbucks' Mobile Order & Pay and Rewards benefits. And as you will hear from Sara, the 1,600 licensed stores that have adopted Starbucks Connect are seeing a significant lift in business since adoption. Starbucks Connect enables us to capture demand across our broader portfolio and will be highly accretive to our business.\nThe momentum we saw in our International segment coming out of Q3 continued in Q4, with revenues for the quarter up 12% to $1.8 billion on a constant currency basis. For the year, revenues grew 9% year-over-year to $6.9 billion, also on a constant currency basis. We added 518 stores during the year and now operate nearly 18,500 stores around the world. We are sensitive to the challenges that the rapid increase in the value of our dollar is posing to our International licensees and remain in close contact as we work together to navigate the dynamic environment that we are all operating in.\nTurning to our Channels business. Starbucks is the #1 share in U.S. at-home coffee. Starbucks is the #1 share in global ready-to-drink coffee, and continued growth in our Global Coffee Alliance with Nestle combined to deliver strong performance in Q4, with revenues increasing 18% on a constant currency basis to $484 million. For the year, revenues also increased 18% to $1.8 billion on a constant currency basis.\nNow let me begin the discussion around China by saying that Starbucks has been in China for 20 years and that our aspirations for our business in China has never been greater. We have over 6,000 stores in China today. And as Belinda shared at Investor Day, we have close to 9,000 stores -- we will have close to 9,000 stores by 2025. We will be opening our Starbucks China Coffee Innovation Park, including our largest coffee roasting and packaging plant outside the U.S. in summer 2023.\nStarbucks employs over 60,000 passionate, dedicated partners in China. Our partners are deeply engaged with their customers and demonstrated by today's record high customer connection scores. We continue to be an employer of choice and lead the way in partner investments, recently introducing a 14th month bonus for all full-time partners. And we continue to invest in China to create career and opportunity paths for our partners and to support the communities we serve.\nWe also continue to expand our customer base in China and deepen our digital connection to customers. Active Starbucks Rewards membership grew 29% sequentially in Q4 over Q3 to over 17 million members, just below historic levels, coinciding with the lifting of restrictions and reflecting the relevance and underlying strength of the Starbucks brand in China.\nMobile ordering sales mix, nonexistent prior to 2019, drove 44% of mix in Q4. Delivery, up 35% year-over-year, now representing over 24% of sales. We expect mobile, digital, loyalty and delivery to continue to grow and drive our business.\nHowever, we are ultrasensitive to the evolving macro challenges that have surfaced regarding China, particularly in connection with the impact of the zero-COVID policy. But our strong belief in China is based on our success in the country and our commitment to playing the long game. We are confident that when COVID disruptions affecting the country abate, Starbucks will emerge not only as the undisputed leader in our category, but likely the #1 Western consumer brand in the country for having continued to meaningfully invest in our partners and in our business throughout the pandemic and despite the disruptions.\nLaxman's immersion is going spectacularly well. He's visited and worked in stores in the U.S. and U.K., quickly connecting and winning the hearts of Starbucks partners wherever he goes, just this week earning his Barista certification in record time and store Green Apron. Laxman's commitment to becoming intimate with store operations and our partner and customer experiences reflects our mutual understanding of what is most important in these early days of his joining Starbucks. He and I engage daily as he absorbs more and more about the company and our business. And the Board, leadership team and I are all deeply invested in his success. I cannot be more confident that Laxman is the right CEO at the right time for Starbucks.\nToday, Laxman has a front-row seat as we launch our all-important holiday season. Soon, along with our leadership team, he will be leading the company, bringing reinvention to life and guiding Starbucks to the next chapters of our storied history.\nIn closing, Starbucks has never been financially stronger, better positioned or more confident in our future as we enter Q1 and holiday and embark on the exciting new era of growth ahead. With that, I'll turn the call over to Frank. Frank?\n\nFrank Foster Britt\n\nChief Strategy Officer, Starbucks Corporation\n\nThank you, Howard, and good afternoon, everyone. It was just 50 days ago that we laid out our reinvention agenda that involve 5 major strategic shifts. First, creating a truly unified global company; second, radically improving our in-store partner experience; thirdly, reimagining our store operating model; fourth, reinvention around what customer connection means; and perhaps, most importantly, redesign the construct of what it means to be a partner at Starbucks.\nWhile still early days, we are seeing progress with several key proxy measures. For example, retention has increased with turnover scores at the hourly Barista level, lower by 1 point versus prior year and 4 points versus prior quarter. Additionally, customer connection scores show a 5-points improvement to pre-pandemic levels. All of these are early but encouraging signs.\nWe fully embrace that our partners are the most critical component to our longer-term performance, and we need to be even better at addressing their needs. Partners who proudly wear the Green Apron have bravely shared their stories and their ideas in our co-creation sessions, and we have concentrated our efforts to jointly create solutions with our partners and for our partners.\nIn the fourth quarter, we continue to improve our already industry-leading benefits to a deeper position of strength with several new programs for partners. Representative examples of improvements include: a new incentivized savings program in partnership with Fidelity, designed to help partners in case of unplanned financial challenges; a new student loan debt program to empower partners looking to find the best ways to address their college debt management obligations; an increase in sick time accrual ratios for our partners; an updated family expansion reimbursement program, aimed to assist partners with the cost of growing their families through adoption and the like.\nWe have remained committed to the critical development opportunities of our people. And as a complement to doubling our partner training hours, as Howard noted, we've reintroduced our iconic Black Apron credentialing program, and nearly 5,000 partners have already earned their apron and continue in the program.\nWe've also launched the pilot of a new partner app designed to create 1 digital community for our 270,000 U.S. and Canada company-owned operated store partners. And over time, this new digital platform will allow partners to stay connected on what matters to them most, including their schedules, their benefits and continuing to use their voice to drive the co-creation of Starbucks. More than 1,000 partners have participated in our testing and are providing feedback for our launch planned for Q2.\nObtaining the right mix and number of hours is essential to a thriving partner experience at Starbucks, and we aim to provide desired hours with flexibility and predictability. We are highly focused on honing our staffing models and operating processes to ensure we can allocate the right amount of talent to each store in every daypart and advancing our capabilities to fine-tune our hours of operations by store to reflect unique demand patterns.\nAs part of the reinvention agenda, all of these efforts share in common a primary focus to grow the lifetime value per partner and are connected to the ongoing reinvention initiatives, including in-store waste reduction and further acceleration of equipment rollout to enable an improved partner experience and higher productivity. We will also continue to focus on accelerating our trade area transformation, modernizing the way technology elevates the store experience and continuing supply chain innovation.\nLonger-term, powered by our partners' insights, we have a very robust agenda and improvement plan powered by a new architecture and vision of the partner experience. And over time, this will translate into an even more partner-centric system in the stores, affirm our reputation as a frontline talent career launchpad and improve retention rates.\nFinally, as part of this new phase of reinvention, we continue to lean into our centralized project management office to drive better integration among our initiatives and more fully capture the synergies across our store and customer innovations. Together, these initiatives are designed to strengthen our business through top line growth and margin expansion and improve the partner experience. I look forward to sharing more of the progress in the quarters ahead.\nLet me now turn it over to my partner, Sara.\n\nSara Trilling\n\nSenior VP & President of Starbucks Asia Pacific, Starbucks Corporation\n\nThank you, Frank, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm Sara Trilling. I'm pleased to join you today for my first earnings call in my new role, leading the North America business.\nWhile I'm relatively new to this particular role, I'm a 20-year partner and most recently served as Senior Vice President of Asia Pacific. Over my Starbucks career, I've touched nearly every aspect of the business and have served many leadership positions across a variety of functions, including store development, retail operations, product and marketing. And I'm looking forward to applying the relevant breadth and depth of my experiences to this next phase of growth in North America.\nTo build on some of the comments from Frank and Howard, we continue to see very healthy growth in our North America business. As we highlighted at Investor Day, we saw the highest net sales week of all time with the launch of our fall promo. And I'm pleased to share this subsequently led to an incredibly strong September, with the 3 high sales weeks in our history.\nOur strong quarter, comparable sales of 11% and revenue growth of 15% were largely driven by a record-breaking fall launch, coupled with continued strategic pricing actions and increased food attach as well as the shift to more premium beverages and a growing demand for personalization in both company-operated as well as licensed businesses.",
        "content2": "Elevated from pre-pandemic levels, we maintained ticket comp strength in our U.S. company-operated business at 10%, representing our fifth consecutive quarter of increased ticket comp. These results reflect the continued strength in demand for Starbucks as our customers fell into their new normal routine and behaviors. We fully expect the momentum from our record fall launch to continue as our highly anticipated holiday at Starbucks launched just today and include some great seasonal offerings.\nWhat gives us further confidence in the holiday season is the strength of the Starbucks brand with younger, more diverse customer groups. More than half our U.S. customer base is Gen Z and Millennials, reflecting relevancy and brand love across generational cohorts, trends we see with diverse customer cohorts as well.\nWe are incredibly pleased with our momentum in the business and the reinforcement of our strategy in the following key areas. First, we've established sustained relevancy of the Starbucks brand in customer loyalty. In fact, Starbucks is consistently, quarter-over-quarter, the leader in market share, first choice and past 30-day visitation when it comes to an away-from-home coffee occasion as measured by our brand equity tracker.\nWe're also pleased to share that customer connection scores have increased 5 points versus pre-pandemic levels. The strength of the brand is further illustrated by the success of our iconic pumpkin spice platform, which grew 17% year-over-year and continues to resonate with customers who love the classic Pumpkin Spice Latte as well as newer additions, such as the Pumpkin Cream Cold Foam modifier.\nSecond, our cold customized beverage strategy is working. We're seeing growth in both hot and cold and increasing customization. In Q4, more than 60% of beverage units sold in the U.S. company-operated business were customized, contributing to the $1 billion and growing annual net sales for modifiers, representing growth of 2x since the first fiscal 2019.\nFinally, we reinforced our unique position in providing experiential convenience as evidenced by all-time highs in Starbucks Rewards engagement amid Mobile Order & Pay orders. The Starbucks Rewards program in the U.S. grew 90-day active members, ending FY '22 with nearly 29 million members. This represents growth of 16% year-over-year and 55% of our U.S. company-operated revenue in the quarter, up nearly 4% from prior year, representing the highest-ever percent of tender. Mobile Order & Pay surpassed 26% in Q4 for the first time in a quarter, finishing fiscal year '22 at 25% of total transactions.\nWe're incredibly optimistic about our continued momentum in digital, following the unprecedented interest in Starbucks Odyssey, the integration of NFTs with our industry-leading loyalty program to create an accessible Web3 community that brings unique aspects of our brand to life in a new way.\nWe also experienced a wildly successful launch of Reward Together with Delta. With this partnership, our Rewards members are able to earn miles faster through their everyday purchase at Starbucks and earn even more Stars on days when they travel with Delta. The initial response from customers has been extraordinary and beyond our expectation, and this is just the start.\nImportantly, we finished the year with nearly 25% of our U.S. license portfolio live with [Starbucks Connect], allowing us to create a seamless digital experience across our stores, giving customers more ways to connect with our brands, furthering the value of the rewards experience.\nAs part of our reinvention and as we shared at our September Investor Day, we're investing in equipment to innovate for an improved partner and customer experience. We have completed the deployment of Starbucks Cold Brewer and have rolled out the Mastrena 2 espresso machine and new warming ovens to nearly 95% and 72%, respectively, of our stores across the U.S.\nThis equipment collectively supports improvement in our throughput during both peak and full day, while providing the foundation to support elevated partner and customer experiences as we further reinvention plan investments and productivity. The rollouts for these 3 items will be completed by fiscal year '23 for our company-operated stores.\nAdditionally, we rolled out nearly 60% of our handheld point-of-sale investments to nearly 75% of our cold beverage labelers. Handheld POS is already helping us capture new and latent demand in support of our ambitious revenue expectations. And we expect to see further benefit as we extend the rollout for handheld POS into fiscal year '24.\nWhile still in the early days of development, partner and customer reception of the new Siren System innovation we shared at Investor Day is overwhelmingly positive, including the Clover Vertica brewer and the new proprietary on-demand cold-pressed Cold Brew technology. We expect to begin rolling out Clover Vertica brewer later in this fiscal year, with our broader Siren System innovations fast following in fiscal year 2024.\nThrough our investments, we're giving our partners more time to focus on coffee craft and connect with customers, enabling them to continue delivering experiential convenience in a way that only Starbucks can. The powerful unlock is our reinvention positions us for sustainable, profitable growth over the long term.\nIn fact, just this last week, we welcomed nearly 2,000 retail leaders from U.S. and Canada to Seattle for our District Manager Leadership Experience. This powerful 3-day event is designed with great intention to provide a renewed understanding of the critical role each leader plays in our business and with our people and equip them fully to lead their stores and store partners through our reinvention and into our future as we all breathe life into this reinvention plan.\nTo close, what I would leave you with -- is with this. This is an incredibly exciting time to lead our North America business. While the macro environment may have uncertainty, our performance is once again demonstrating the strength and resilience of our brand and our business. We are well positioned in this environment, which will only further strengthen as our reinvention comes to life. I'll now turn it over to Rachel.\n\nRachel Ruggeri\n\nExecutive VP, CFO & Principal Accounting Officer, Starbucks Corporation\n\nThank you, Sara, and welcome to your first Starbucks earnings call. And good afternoon, everyone. As you heard throughout this call, starting with Howard, we had record-breaking performance this quarter, and I'm incredibly proud of what we achieved together. We finished fiscal year 2022 with consistently strong demand in the U.S. and in nearly all major markets across the globe, with that demand sustaining as we exited the year.\nOur Q4 consolidated revenue reached another historical high, $8.4 billion, up 11% from the prior year or 14% when excluding a 3% impact of foreign currency translation. The revenue growth was primarily driven by 7% comparable store sales growth and 6% net-new store growth over the past 12 months, further strengthened by the remarkable momentum in our global licensed store businesses. In addition, this outstanding performance reflects double-digit revenue growth in all 3 of our reporting segments in constant currencies, showcasing the resiliency of our brand, power of customer loyalty and depth of our diverse portfolio.\nQ4 consolidated operating margin contracted 380 basis points from the prior year to 15.1%, primarily driven by investments in growth in labor, including enhanced store partner wages and new partner training, part of which were investments under our reinvention plan. In addition, operating margin was impacted by inflationary headwinds and deleverage related to COVID restrictions in China. The overall contraction was partially offset by pricing in North America and sales leverage across markets outside of China.\nQ4 EPS was $0.81, declining 9% from the prior year, but better than expectations, including $0.05 of nonrecurring benefits primarily related to discrete tax benefits. For full year fiscal 2022, our consolidated revenue reached a record $32.3 billion, up 13% from the prior year or 15% when excluding a 2% impact of foreign currency translation driven by 8% comparable store growth, 6% net-new store growth and strength in our global licensed store businesses. Full year consolidated operating margin and EPS were 15.1% and $2.96, respectively.\nI will now provide segment highlights for Q4. North America delivered revenue of $6.1 billion in Q4, up 15% from the prior year and another all-time record, primarily driven by an 11% increase in comparable store sales, inclusive of a 10% increase in average ticket as well as net-new store growth of 3% over the past 12 months. Impressive momentum in our U.S. licensed store business also contributed to the segment's record revenue performance.\nMy colleagues spoke in detail about our incredible U.S. performance in Q4, posting 11% comparable store sales growth. Average ticket once again broke a record, primarily driven by pricing and food attach. Despite elevated pricing actions taken throughout the year, daily store traffic in the U.S. reached approximately 95% pre-pandemic levels in September, fueled by the wildly successful fall promotion.\nImportantly, the volume of beverage and food items sold per store has well-exceeded pre-pandemic levels, and the number of unique customers, again, reached an all-time high in Q4, up 9% over the prior year and up more than 1% versus prior quarter, underscoring our brand's expanding reach and relevance and customer loyalty. North America's operating margin was 19% in Q4, contracting 270 basis points from the prior year, primarily due to investments in growth in labor, including enhanced store partner wages and new partner training as well as inflationary headwinds, partially offset by pricing and sales leverage.\nOur disciplined actions to closely manage labor hours, reduce waste and prioritize discretionary spend also contributed to the segment's margin performance as we build a strong foundation for progressive margin expansion in years to come.\nMoving on to International. The segment delivered third quarter revenue of $1.8 billion, down 1% from the prior year or up nearly 12% when excluding a 12% unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. This double-digit revenue growth in constant currencies was driven by sustained strength in all major markets outside of China as well as an 8% increase in total store count over the past 12 months. The growth was partially offset by a 5% decline in comparable store sales as the impacts of COVID continued in China.\nAs Howard discussed, our China market continued its recovery in Q4, navigating through reoccurring COVID outbreaks and turbulent consumer mobility. The market posted a comp decline of 16% in Q4, a meaningful sequential improvement from a 44% decline in Q3. Despite this depressed traffic, the China team's outstanding leadership and strength of our brand were markedly evident in the quarter as reflected in record levels of store development, growth in delivery and the highest-ever customer connection scores.\nOutside of China and excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, our diverse international markets across the globe sustained incredible momentum in Q4. Collectively, the market's revenue growth exceeded 30% in the quarter when excluding a 19% unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation. International segment's net-new stores reached a quarterly record at 518, climbing to more than 18,000 stores in total, setting the stage for a new era of growth, with a rapidly expanding footprint around the world.\nOperating margin for the International segment was 14.5% in Q4, down 750 basis points from the prior year, mainly driven by deleverage related to COVID restrictions in China, lower government subsidies as well as partner investments. The contraction was partially offset by pricing and strong sales leverage across markets outside of China.\nShifting to channel development. The segment's revenue grew 16% to $484 million in Q4 or up 18% when excluding a 2% impact from foreign currency translation driven by growth in both the Global Coffee Alliance and our global ready-to-drink businesses. Channel Development continued to play a vital role in differentiating, diversifying and amplifying our brand by creating customer occasions outside our stores. As a result, Starbucks remains the market leader in both the total U.S. at-home coffee and ready-to-drink categories.\nBuilding on the success of our newer platforms, the segment's robust innovations continued in the quarter, including the introductions of ready-to-drink Starbucks Pumpkin Cream Nitro Cold Brew in the U.S. and bottled Frappuccino Smoothie in China, to name a few. The segment's operating margin was 50.6% in Q4, down 170 basis points from the prior year, mainly driven by business mix shift.\nLet's now move on to our fiscal 2023 outlook, which reflects the beginning of a new era of growth. Our guidance remains consistent with what we shared at our Investor Day in September. So today, I will reaffirm and refine the guidance specific to fiscal year 2023. And we'll also introduce an outlook on a few below-the-line metrics that were not part of our Investor Day guidance.\nStarting with the first building block of our growth, comparable store sales growth. We expect fiscal 2023 U.S. comparable sales growth to grow in the range of 7% to 9%. For China, we're expecting outsized comp in fiscal year 2023 as we lap the severity of the lockdowns in the market. Given the quarterly shape of the fiscal 2022 baseline, we expect China comp to be negative in the first quarter, followed by outsized comp in the balance of the year.\nOur fiscal 2023 global comp growth is expected to be near the high end of our long-term target range of 7% to 9%, consistent with what I shared at Investor Day. And global comp in Q1, reflecting negative comp in China, is expected to be at the low end of the annual guidance range, then expanding in subsequent quarters.\nMoving on to the second building block, new store growth. We expect our U.S. store count to grow by approximately 3% in fiscal year 2023. In China, we will continue to rapidly expand our store footprint, with approximately 13% growth expected in fiscal year 2023. We expect our global store growth to reach approximately 7%, with over 75% of the growth coming from outside of the U.S. as we continue to diversify our portfolio globally.\nWith this powerful combination of global comp and store growth, coupled with our Channel Development performance, we expect our consolidated revenue growth to reach the range of 10% to 12% in fiscal year 2023 despite an approximately 3 percentage point unfavorable impact expected from foreign currency translation.\nWithin fiscal 2023, the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation is expected to reach approximately 4 percentage points in the first half of the fiscal year, tempering to approximately 1 to 2 percentage points in the back half of the year. Despite the considerable pressure we now expect from foreign currency translation, which could abate, we remain confident in our revenue guidance range for the full year. We have a solid path to capture strong demand, maximize opportunities unlocked from our reinvention plan and deliver attractive revenue results.\nOur third building block is operating margin. Globally, we expect solid margin expansion in fiscal year 2023. In terms of a quarterly shape, we expect operating margin to be tempered in Q1 and Q2, with meaningfully higher margins in Q3 and Q4 as margin benefits accumulate from the continued unlocking of the reinvention plan, coupled with the expected recovery in China.\nIn addition to the quarterly shape of operating margin, here are a few points to consider. We expect over $1 billion incremental investments in fiscal year 2023, half of which will reflect the annualization of the fiscal 2022 investments. We expect headwinds related to supply chain and commodity inflationary pressures to continue in fiscal 2023, albeit to a lesser extent relative to fiscal 2022. Headwinds will be managed through sales leverage, pricing and productivity from the reinvention, resulting in positive margin expansion as the year progresses, as I previously mentioned.\nThe fourth building block is capital allocation. We expect our CapEx in fiscal 2023 to be approximately $2.5 billion. As we shared during our Investor Day, we also expect to return approximately $20 billion to shareholders in the next 3 years between dividends and share buybacks. We remain committed to targeting an approximately 50% dividend payout ratio as reflected in the recently announced dividend increase, and we'll also resume our buyback program in fiscal 2023. We expect the buyback benefit on EPS to be initially limited until fiscal 2024, when the benefit is expected to reach approximately 1%, calculated net of interest expense.\nIn regards to interest expense, we expect between $540 million and $560 million of interest expense in fiscal 2023, up from $483 million in fiscal 2022. This increase, driven by incremental debt issuances in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2023 as outlined in our capital allocation strategy. Importantly, we remain committed to our BBB+ credit rating and leverage cap of 3x rent-adjusted EBITDA.\nAs for tax rates in fiscal 2023, we expect our effective GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates to be in the mid-20% range. This is up from our fiscal 2022 GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates of 22.4% and 23.1%, respectively, which benefited from certain discrete tax items that are not expected to repeat to the same degree in fiscal 2023.\nFinally, based on the current environment, we expect foreign currency translation to have approximate 4 percentage point unfavorable impact on fiscal 2023 earnings growth. Despite that, we continue to expect fiscal 2023 GAAP EPS growth to be at the high end of the 15% to 20% range. Fiscal 2023 non-GAAP EPS growth is expected to be at the low end of the long-term range of 15% to 20% as the benefits of the reinvention investments will take time to amplify.\nIt's important to note that Q4 fiscal 2022 included approximately $0.05 of nonrecurring items, largely from discrete tax benefits. And considering the quarterly EPS shape, we expect it to mirror the quarterly shape of operating margin, which will also have a meaningful step-up in the second half of the fiscal year.\nIn closing, here are key takeaways from my discussion today. We are incredibly proud of our Q4 performance, underpinned by the experience our partners create for our customers each and every day. Our 2023 guidance sets the stage for another year of record performance. Importantly, we recognize that our future growth is dependent on our investments in our partners, stores and customers. As we lean in and solve the challenges of our business, together with our partners, we are confident of our path to unlock a new era of growth, creating value for all stakeholders, partners, customers and shareholders.\nOnce again, our success is earned through our more than 450,000 Green Apron partners working across the globe to elevate the Starbucks experience each and every day. Their commitment and their unwavering focus will continue to be the cornerstone of our new era of growth.\nWith that, we will open the call to Q&A. Operator?"

Schultz\n\nCEO, Founder & Director, Starbucks Corporation\n\nThank you, Tiffany. Good afternoon, and welcome to everyone on today's call. Starbucks' strong Q3 results highlighted by 9% global revenue growth to a record $8.2 billion, 3% global comp growth and 9% comp growth in North America once again demonstrates the power and resilience of the Starbucks business and brand all over the world.\nI've now been back as CEO for 4 months. During that time, I've immersed myself in every segment, region, operation and aspect of our business. And given my long history with the company and our culture and my unique understanding and appreciation of the Starbucks brand, the drivers of our global business and the special relationship that exists among our people, our brand and our customers, we've been able to pinpoint the source of each of the issues and challenges confronting the company upon my return. Some are definitely COVID related. Some were a function of not focusing on the long term. And unfortunately, many were self-induced. More important, we now have clear line of sight on what we need to do to totally reinvent the company and drive accelerated profitable growth around the world.\nThe Q3 results we announced today demonstrate the early progress we have made in just 4 short months and serve as a proof point of the significant long-term global growth opportunity ahead for Starbucks. Each business segment contributed to our Q3 performance. I'm particularly pleased that we delivered our results in the face of stiff ongoing consumer economic and inflationary headwinds; COVID lockdowns across China that kept Shanghai, our largest China market, largely closed for 2 months, and that continues episodically today; and continuing shifts in customer traffic and behaviors, including materially reduced office occupancy in our largest urban markets.\nOur Q3 performance underscores the success of the investments we are making in our people, extending our global leadership around everything coffee and in groundbreaking beverage, food, digital and technology innovation that is deepening our connection to customers in every market and every channel. And our performance demonstrates that the Starbucks Experience is more relevant and important than ever in today's unsettled world.\nOn today's call, I will highlight the drivers of our Q3 revenue, comp and EPS performance. I will then turn the call over to Frank Britt, our Chief Strategy Officer, to provide an overview of our reinvention plan, the strategy underpinning the investments we are making to materially elevate our partner, customer and store experiences.\nNext month, at Investor Day in Seattle, you will see for yourselves how accretive to our business our reinvention plan will be, increasing efficiency, enabling us to seamlessly handle the increasing demand in our U.S. stores and, most of all, elevating our partner, customer and in-store experiences. Our reinvention plan touches every aspect of the Starbucks Experience and sets us up for accelerated long-term profitable growth and value creation benefiting all stakeholders beginning in 2023. We are executing against the reinvention plan with focus, with discipline and a deep sense of urgency.\nNext, Belinda will update you on China, where our position in the market and our aspirations for the future have never been greater. Rachel will provide a deep dive into our Q3 financial and operating results. And then we'll move on to Q&A.\nCore to Starbucks' success and long-term growth strategy is our global leadership around everything coffee. No company in the world even remotely approaches Starbucks' ability to source, blend, roast and craft the world's best coffees. And in Q3, we continued to extend our coffee leadership, innovate and bring further elements of customization and premiumization to the entire coffee category, including around cold, handcrafted and plant-based coffee beverages.\nCustomer demand for specifically customized cold coffee beverages, a category Starbucks single-handedly created and is now expanding around the world, is so strong that cold beverages now account for roughly 75% of our total beverage sales in U.S. company-operated stores. Customers are increasingly customizing their cold beverages by adding modifiers that enable the creation of a virtually unlimited range of taste, flavor and color profiles and then sharing their unique cold beverage creations with the world through social media.\nStarbucks' unique ability to deliver handcrafted, customized cold beverages that satisfy customer desires and different need states while creating opportunities for customers' self-expression deepens our connection to customers, sets us apart from any other industry participant and provides us with a significant ongoing competitive advantage in the marketplace. Iced Shaken Espresso, introduced onto our Iced Espresso platform only last year, is resonating so wildly with our Gen Z customers that it has already become the fastest-growing product category in our U.S. company-operated stores, growing 50% year-over-year, more than doubling year-to-date and importantly creating new customer occasions in the midday and afternoon dayparts. Iced Shaken Espresso was also resonating around the world. In China, for example, where Iced Shaken Espresso was only introduced in June of this year, it is already among our best-selling iced coffee beverages despite mobility restrictions in China.\nJust to summarize what's going on with cold and specifically customized beverages. The premium customized cold coffee opportunity ahead for Starbucks all around the world is simply enormous.\nLet me turn to North America. The very strong demand for Starbucks coffee in the U.S. that we reported on our Q2 call has accelerated in Q3. U.S. company-operated stores delivered record average weekly sales, 5 of the top 10 grossing sales day in our history and a $410 million sales week. In North America, overall, the combination of customer shift towards premium cold beverages, increased customization, strategic decisions on our part with regard to beverage and food and modifier pricing and a 19% increase in food sales, driving net revenues up 13%.\nIn addition, our North American licensed stores business, now 7,000 stores strong and growing, also posted strong results with 24% revenue growth in the quarter. While we are sensitive to the impact inflation and economic uncertainty are having on consumers, it's critically important that you all understand we are not currently seeing any measurable reduction in customer spending or any evidence of customers trading down, reflecting the strength of the Starbucks brand, deep customer engagement and loyalty, pricing power and the premium nature of our beverage and food offerings.\nWhat's driving some of the increase in traffic and the strength in our business is our Rewards program. Active Starbucks Rewards membership in Q3 totaled 27.4 million members, up 3.2 million or 13% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. Our loyal Starbucks Rewards members drove a record 53% of U.S. company-operated revenue. Mobile Order & Pay, drive-through and delivery also remained quite strong, driving 72% of our U.S. revenue. Increased Starbucks Rewards membership, customer excitement over our beverage and food offerings plus a fantastic holiday lineup that I'm certain will delight our customers gives us tremendous confidence heading into holiday and 2023.\nMy first order of business upon returning to Starbucks in April was to meet with Starbucks retail store and roasting plant partners across the United States in order to better understand the state of our business and the challenges confronting our partners and the company. It soon became clear that record demand in our stores was masking significant underlying issues, including, as we shared in our last call, store designs that were ill-suited to the evolving customer behavior and traffic patterns we are seeing post COVID.\nOur stores, in many ways, are windows on America. And our partners everywhere shared similar anxieties over a wide range of issues affecting their families and their lives around safety, around mental, physical and financial health issues over the widening cultural and racial divide in the state of our country and the world. Many question whether the American Dream and economic mobility was still realistic aspirations. Our partners also shared how hard it had become to keep up with customer demand and how insufficient training had left new partners unprepared for their roles, challenging partner and customer experiences alike.\nThe conversations were raw and, in many ways, painful for our leaders to hear. But core to Starbucks culture is the requirement that we always speak with each other with honesty, transparency and without judgment or fear of appraisal. The truth is, at times, I was overwhelmed by what I heard. The challenges, the fears, the desire for emotional and financial security and the sense of belonging in our partners' lives amid an all uncertainty world.\nAt the same time, I found myself feeling so proud, so appreciative and oftentimes in awe of our partners across the country who showed up every day committed to delivering an elevated Starbucks Experience to our customers and communities despite the personal challenges and obstacles they were experiencing.\nWe were in a moment where Starbucks leaders needed to put themselves in the shoes of our partners and demonstrate great empathy and compassion towards them, and we needed to address our partners' concerns with urgency. What began as informal partner meeting soon evolved into focused co-creation sessions where Starbucks partners and leaders collaborated on how best to reimagine the next Starbucks. We've since held over 100 co-creation sessions. And from these sessions, our reinvention plan has taken shape.\nToday, over 30 cross-functional teams are focused exclusively on executing the U.S. reinvention plan you will see take shape over the quarters ahead. And in time, you will see best practices shared around the world. We assembled our 200 top U.S. executives in Seattle last month to kick off Starbucks reinvention and change agenda. In a few minutes, Frank Britt, a key architect of the plan, will provide you with an overview so you can begin to understand how accretive each pillar of the plan will be to our business and brand long into the future.\nThe strong revenue growth we delivered in North America in Q3 is being replicated globally. With the exception of China where the zero COVID policy continues to result in mobility restrictions and limited store operations, each one of our international regions grew revenues by double digits in Q3. It's an extraordinary accomplishment, reflecting both the strength of the Starbucks brand and strong and accelerating demand for Starbucks coffee all over the world.\nOur International performance also underscores the correctness of our strategies of investing ahead of the curve in beverage, digital and technology innovation that is relevant to our customers in driving new store growth in every market in which we operate. Overall, our International segment, excluding China, grew revenue 33% year-over-year or 50% excluding FX while meaningfully expanding operating margin, reflecting the strong operating leverage inherent in our complementary portfolio of company-operated and licensed stores.\nLast month, several Starbucks leaders joined me on a multi-country tour across several strategic theaters of our EMEA business. In every country we visited, we were inspired by what we heard, felt and observed. Product quality, service execution and knowledge of coffee across EMEA are all delivered at the highest levels. Our EMEA teams are executing while weaving together a powerful emotional connection and sense of belonging among our partners and customers with the Starbucks Experience being the shared medium of exchange. And our EMEA partners are literally thriving, inspired and earnestly engaged in bringing our unique culture of respect, purpose, service and an authentic and aspirational love of coffee to life.\nInterestingly, while thousands of stores in many countries drove strong financial performance during the quarter, I want to showcase one market in particular that serves as a proxy for the strength of the Starbucks brand and demonstrates the enormity of the international opportunity ahead, Italy. Italy, a market we only recently entered and a market that is close to my heart and that no one ever expected us to succeed in. Starbucks is flourishing in Italy. The quality of the coffee, the food and the partner and customer experiences are second to none. Traffic in our Milano Roastery, Starbucks' shrine to coffee, is strong throughout the day, driven largely by tourist activity. But most importantly, traffic in our Italy retail stores is largely local customer driven. And when I was there, what I observed is Italians drinking straight espresso at Starbucks. We are being warmly welcomed in Italy, the country in which our Starbucks journey literally began. Given the success we are enjoying in Milan, we are now planning to open in Rome and in Florence.\nAs home to our EMEA roasting operations, Amsterdam is a strategic foothold for our international efforts. In July, we committed to a planned expansion that will materially increase our roasting capacity in order to meet the rapidly growing demand for Starbucks coffee across the region. Similar efforts are underway to support a supply chain team that currently handles logistics to over 4,000 stores across 42 countries in EMEA.\nIn Switzerland, we held highly productive sessions with our partners at Nestle. Global Coffee is among Nestle's largest strategic growth categories, and our partnership with Nestle now extends across 81 markets, focusing on at-home coffee and food service channels.\nBuilding on our #1 share position in the United States at home, retail and CPG coffee channels, we are in the very early stages of leveraging the Starbucks brand and Nestle's Global Coffee platforms and significant distribution capabilities to create new super premium coffee occasions on Nespresso platform all around the world. Our partnership with Nestle is driving meaningful competitive advantages for both companies in the marketplace and is highly accretive to our business.\nLooking ahead, we expect to see a closer Starbucks-Nestle partnership. This includes introduction of Starbucks varietals onto Nespresso's digital sales platform, a channel that does not presently exist for us and represents a massive global opportunity. Expansion of Starbucks-Nestle partnership to include inclusion of many traditional Starbucks varietals on the Nespresso digital platform, co-creation of Starbucks Reserve varietals for the virtual platform and the development of a Nespresso experience in our U.S. Roasteries. We're also looking forward to the launch of our ready-to-drink Starbucks coffees in Southeast Asia, Oceania and Latin America, which will begin rolling out in next quarter.\nIn China, mobility restrictions and limits on in-store dining continue to significantly impact the business. However, as Belinda will soon share, we are beginning to see green shoots of recovery with sales and comps coming out of the quarter, reflecting sequential improvement.\nLastly, we have been working on a very exciting new digital initiative that builds on our existing industry-leading digital platform and innovative new ways, all centered around coffee and, most importantly, loyalty that we will reveal at Investor Day. We believe this new digital Web 3-enabled initiative will allow us to build on the current Starbucks Rewards engagement model with its powerful spend-to-earn Stars approach while also introducing new methods of emotionally engaging customers, expanding our digital third place community and offering a broader set of rewards, including one-of-a-kind experiences that you can't get anywhere else, integrating our digital Starbucks Rewards ecosystem with Starbucks-branded digital collectibles as both a reward and a community building element.\nThis will create an entirely new set of digital network effects that will attract new customers and be accretive to existing customers in our core retail stores. As I mentioned at the outset, we are looking forward to fully showcasing the power and the opportunity of our reinvention plan that we will unleash at next month's Investor Day.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Frank Britt.\n\nFrank Britt\n\nThank you, Howard, and good afternoon, everyone. I've had the good fortune of joining our company during one of its most exciting times, a time of reinvention. We have come together as a Starbucks community and architected a comprehensive plan to future-proof and profitably grow the company. Our path forward is being informed by tens of thousands of daily customer experiences and our partner stories, ideas and dreams that have all helped shape over the past several months through on-hand collaboration sessions, digital surveys, live open forums and in direct dialogue with our key leaders. This process is indicative of a new and wide-ranging approach to democratizing innovation at Starbucks.\nOur reinvention efforts will begin with our core U.S. company-owned retail business, and over time, we'll expand across our global footprint. Specifically, we have prioritized 5 major strategic shifts to pivot the U.S. business in a new direction. Today, we will provide the guideposts and address the what of the overall program, while the how of this agenda will be reviewed on Investor Day in September.\nTo that end, first, powered by ongoing partner co-creation, we work to further connect the company to truly operate as one global enterprise enabled by new ways of working and a range of contemporary practices and tools. To start, for the U.S. company-owned retail business, we will focus on better integrating our culture and values across the 3 cohorts of our retail partners, operations partners and support center partners. Our end game is a greater focus as a single company with agility and empowered organization. And we see this work as the fabric that will help bind our change management agenda and will be meaningfully catalytic to our long-term operating and financial performance.\nSecondly, we are fully embracing the need to radically improve our in-store partner experience. We know that our partners are vital to bringing an elevated Starbucks brand to our customers every day, and we seek to honor, empower and affirm their strategic importance. The first principles of our new partner engagement approach include both greater safety and kindness in our stores, personalized career pathway that drives advancement and opportunity and an explicit and personal emphasis on improving overall partner well-being.\nTo that end, as we shared in our last earnings call, we have several high-impact improvement efforts in flight, including this week's wage acceleration for all U.S. in-store partners, doubling in-store partner training investments, reintroduction of our iconic Black Apron and Coffee Masters credential and the implementation of a new digital partner engagement platform. We also expect to roll out both the universal tipping and a new recognition and badging platform by calendar year-end 2022. Each of these substantial actions are part of a multiphase path to reinventing the retail partner experience that we expect will have a direct positive effect on partner retention, customer connection and essential brand affinity metrics.\nThird, we must reimagine our stores. This starts with the core engine of production that must be better calibrated for the customer habits of today and deliver superior experiences through personalization across every format and in every channel. Innovations such as new bar configurations, patented coffee technology, novel store prototypes are high priorities in the plan designed to improve throughput and heavily customized beverages, along with both customer and partner experience. Our high-priority improvement efforts include key equipment acceleration to drive more efficient and effective operations such as Clover Vertica and expansive renovation and new store agenda.\nFourth, we will further evolve how we reconnect with customers, mindful that each individual consumer must be provided a uniquely personal experience that is unified across channels. Building on our strong track record of superior customer engagement, representative initiatives in this sphere included a reimagined approach for customer-facing products and platforms, new models of effortless digital ordering and further growing the value proposition of our loyalty programs through novel and new strategic partnerships.\nFifth, we will redesign what partnership means at Starbucks, creating new ways to continue to evolve us from a listening company to a co-creation company. This translates into new approaches to shared innovation, shared accountability and shared success. This is both a competitive and a generational necessity. And for us, it's actually quite natural. Starbucks is built through the power of our partners' ideas and voices, and we know that reinvention must first unleash and then harness the power within every one of our partners.\nFinally, it's important to be declarative that within our highly integrative change agenda, coffee innovation is far more than an initiative or a project. Instead, the role of coffee will be threaded throughout each of our priorities and serve as our inspiration, foundation and fiercest differentiator in defining the future of Starbucks.",
        "content2": "In summary, we firmly believe that when you combine the 5 strategic reinvention areas, bolstered by a rich tapestry of aligned initiatives and the reaffirmation of the importance of coffee, you will begin to see the emergence of a Starbucks that once again drives outsized performance financially, outsized impact socially and creates a work environment where all of our partners feel greater personal agency and are providing a personalized career path that matches their unique needs and aspirations. In the end, our goal is to become a wholly new kind of company that again sets a new higher standard for our industry and our business overall. We look forward to sharing more details on our Investor Day in September.\nAnd now I'll turn the call over to Belinda.\n\nChing Ying Wong\n\nChairman & CEO of Starbucks China, Starbucks Corporation\n\nThank you, Frank. In Q3, China faced its most severe COVID disruption since the onset of the pandemic. Mobility restrictions and lockdowns were implemented faster and eased more slowly under China's zero COVID policy. Shanghai, our largest market with more than 940 stores, was completely locked down for approximately 2/3 of the quarter. In Beijing, 150 stores or roughly 1/3 of our stores in the market were closed for almost 6 weeks with the balance of our Beijing stores operating without indoor dining.\nWe entered Q3 with over 1,300 stores, close to 1/4 of our total portfolio, temporarily closed. We exited the quarter with roughly 2,000 stores across nearly 50 cities operating with mandated reductions in seating capacity or other COVID restrictions. Similar patterns remain today with COVID restrictions being eased in some cities and new restrictions imposed in others. We continue to expect our recovery in China to be nonlinear.\nIn Q3, we continued to deepen our partnerships with suppliers, landlords and local authorities, streamline and adapt our supply chain, add new chapters to our COVID playbook and position the business for accelerated profitable growth as soon as COVID restrictions are fully lifted. Together, these efforts have provided us the flexibility and muscle we need to continue to operate as efficiently as possible given current market challenges. As a result, we were able to move quickly to reopen 90% of our Shanghai stores just within a few days of the city reopening.\nWe continue to put our partners first, ensuring their safety and well-being and compensating them fully even when our stores were closed. In turn, our partners continue to deliver exceptional experiences for our customers, as reflected in the record high customer connection scores we achieved in Q3.\nCOVID is forcing Starbucks to become more flexible, resilient and agile in China and get even better at operating and executing at scale. The benefit of our investments in our people and our operations will become increasingly evident in post-COVID quarters and years ahead.\nCOVID-related headwinds in Q3 resulted in Starbucks net revenue in China declining 40% and sales comp declining 44% versus last year. But I'm pleased to report that we saw immediate improvement in traffic and sales following Shanghai's reopening in early June, saw steady sequential improvement in both metrics through the month and exited the quarter with a negative comp of 24% after indoor dining restrictions in Shanghai were partially lifted at the end of June. The improvement was fueled by customers returning to our stores and celebrating the reconnection and familiarity with the Starbucks brand. We're seeing a strong positive correlation between comp improvement and the easing of COVID restrictions, giving us confidence that we'll see both a strong rebound in sales and improved flow-through once mobility restrictions in China are fully lifted.\nWe continued our store expansion in Q3, opening 107 net new stores and entering 3 new cities despite the headwinds and now operate 5,761 stores across 228 cities. And we remain on track to have 6,000 stores in China by the end of this year. Our new stores continue to achieve best-in-class returns and profitability.\nThe investments we're making to elevate our customers' digital experience and strengthen their digital connection to Starbucks are paying off. Mobile ordering sales mix increased to a record high 47% in Q3, up 13% over prior year and up 4% over Q2 as we adapted to COVID-driven changes in customer behavior. We also continue to invest in product innovation and extending Starbucks coffee leadership and authority in China. As Howard mentioned, Iced Shaken Espresso introduced only in June has already become one of our best-selling iced coffee beverages among our Gen Z customers, driving both sales and incremental traffic.\nOur Q3 performance demonstrates the resilience of the Starbucks brand and business in China and that we're continuing our relentless focus on the long term even as we navigate short-term disruptions, positioning us to resume accelerated and long-term sustainable growth in China as soon as COVID restrictions are fully lifted. I want to sincerely thank all of our partners in China for their dedication, commitment and deep loyalty and for taking care of our communities, our customers and each other during this unprecedented time.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Rachel. Rachel?\n\nRachel Ruggeri\n\nExecutive VP, CFO & Principal Accounting Officer, Starbucks Corporation\n\nThank you, Belinda, and good afternoon, everyone. As Howard mentioned at the top of the call, we delivered record-breaking revenue performance during the quarter, driven by continued strong customer demand globally despite a greater-than-expected impact from mobility restrictions in China. We also exceeded our earnings expectations, demonstrating our ability to effectively deliver results while executing on planned investments and navigating a dynamic environment.\nIn Q3, we delivered record quarterly global revenue of $8.2 billion, up 9% from the prior year or 11% when excluding the 2% impact of foreign currency translation. Our strong growth was driven by double-digit revenue growth in the U.S. as well as nearly all major markets and channels across our global portfolio, partially offset by a 40% decline in China revenue.\nQ3 consolidated operating margin contracted 350 basis points from the prior year to 16.9%, primarily driven by ongoing inflationary headwinds, significant investments in labor, including enhanced store partner wages and deleverage related to COVID lockdowns in China. These were partially offset by pricing in North America and leverage outside of China. Q3 EPS was $0.84, declining 15% from the prior year but ahead of expectations.\nI will now provide segment highlights for Q3. North America delivered revenue of $6.1 billion in Q3, up 13% from the prior year and also an all-time record, primarily driven by a 9% increase in comparable store sales, including an 8% increase in average ticket as well as net new store growth over the past 12 months. Compelling growth in our U.S. licensed store business also contributed to the segment's strong revenue performance.\nOur U.S. business posted 9% comparable store sales growth, driven by ticket, a remarkable feat considering we were lapping a record-breaking quarter from last year. Our average ticket reached an all-time high yet again with the year-over-year increase driven by strategic pricing actions and food attach.\nStrong food attach is a direct result of continued innovation, which resonates with our customers. New items, including our Lime-Frosted Coconut Bar and staples such as the Grilled Cheese Sandwich, both performed well. Our creative innovation approach has led to successful beverage and food pairings, fueling food attach and driving daypart growth. While transactions remained below pre-pandemic levels, average weekly sales and unique customer counts reached record levels in the quarter, demonstrating that the Starbucks brand is reaching more customers than ever, and customers are highly engaged when they frequent our stores.\nAs both Howard and Frank discussed, we are singularly focused on executing the reinvention plan. Although measurable benefits of the reinvention plan investments will begin to manifest in FY '23, we are encouraged by the investments made so far this year, as we've already experienced increased labor availability and stability, more predictable operating hours as well as higher partner engagement scores in the U.S.\nOur tenured partner turnover, those with 1 to 2 years of tenure, has also improved, evidence that our targeted investments to address wage compression are making a difference. We know based on data across our more than 9,000 U.S. company-operated stores that stores with lower turnover and higher partner engagement tend to have better operational and financial metrics relative to their peer set, often leading to better overall customer connection stores. We believe our intentional and targeted investments, which are part of the reinvention plan, will meaningfully elevate the Starbucks Experience for partners, stores and customers.\nNorth America's operating margin was 22.2% in Q3, contracting 250 basis points from the prior year, primarily due to ongoing inflationary headwinds, labor investments, including enhanced store partner wages and new partner training support costs, partially offset by pricing. While we begin executing investments under the reinvention plan, we were also focused on taking disciplined actions to offset margin pressures. Such measures include targeted pricing actions, store throughput initiatives and prioritization of discretionary spend, enabling the segment to fund critical investments while delivering Q3 performance as planned.\nMoving on to International. The segment delivered third quarter revenue of $1.6 billion, down 6% from the prior year or up 3% when excluding a 9% unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. We saw strong sales growth across every major market in the segment outside of China and increased our net new store count by 8% over the last 12 months. The growth was partially offset by an 18% decline in comparable store sales, reflecting the severe impacts of COVID lockdowns across China, as Belinda noted.\nOutside of China, the tremendous growth of our international markets across our global portfolio continued into Q3, growing at 50% and more than offsetting the revenue challenges we experienced in China when excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. Virtually all of our key markets and regions posted double-digit revenue growth, including our licensed markets. Most of these markets' revenues have reached or exceeded pre-COVID levels and have set new record highs in recent quarters, driven by strong innovation and expanded digital capabilities. Strong momentum, combined with the sizable opportunity afforded by new store formats, gives us great confidence in the long runway of growth ahead for our international markets.\nOperating margin for the International segment was 12.4% in Q3, down 950 basis points from the prior year, mainly driven by the leverage related to COVID impacts in China, sustained inflationary headwinds, lapping higher prior year government subsidies as well as partner investments, partially offset by strong sales leverage across markets outside of China.\nLooking ahead, however, the International segment may face near-term challenges. Given the prolonged lockdowns in China with limited mobility recovery in Q3, the headwinds now extend into Q4 as the market continues to recover. The current pace of recovery implies that China's operating income contribution as a percent of global operating income may be reduced further than what we had previously anticipated to roughly 1/4 of the contribution realized in a typical fiscal year. Outside of China, the increase in COVID cases around the world may temper the rapid growth we are currently seeing in many markets.\nMoving on to channel development. The segment's revenue grew 16% to $480 million in Q3, driven by growth in both the Global Coffee Alliance and our ready-to-drink businesses. Channel development continues to play an essential role in amplifying and diversifying the Starbucks presence around the world and creating new occasions. Starbucks remains the market leader in both the total U.S. at-home coffee and ready-to-drink categories. As Howard mentioned, our partnership with Nestle continues to strengthen, and we're pleased with the competitive advantage it has created and excited about the heightened performance the strategic partnership will unleash.\nNewer platforms continue to be significant drivers of growth for the Global Coffee Alliance, including Starbucks by Nespresso and Starbucks Creamers. Within our ready-to-drink lineups, we continue to be pleased with our recent product innovations like our new chilled cup offerings in our international markets with robust innovations in the pipeline fueling continued long-term growth. The segment's operating margin was 40% in Q3, down 670 basis points from the prior year, mainly driven by a decline in joint venture income related to our U.S. ready-to-drink business, primarily due to inflation as well as business mix shift.\nNow moving on to the balance of fiscal year '22. While our guidance remains suspended for the balance of this fiscal year, we wanted to provide some insights regarding Q4. We now expect our Q4 margin and EPS to be lower than Q3 with greater year-over-year pressures primarily due to 3 reasons. First, the start of mobility recovery in China was later than expected, impacting the pace of recovery previously assumed in Q4. Second, our Q3 performance benefited from approximately $0.05 of nonrecurring benefits, including release of a custom duties accrual, tax credits, government subsidies and other items which we do not expect to continue in Q4. And third, as previously announced, Q4 will be impacted by a sequential step-up in our investments as well as our typical seasonality.\nBetween executing on the reinvention plan and other investments such as increases in wage benefits announced earlier this year, we expect our U.S. investments to more than double from Q3 to Q4. Although these factors will impact our Q4 results, they're expected to be transitory in nature, and our commitment to accelerating long-term growth remains intact.\nFrom a shareholder return perspective, although we announced the suspension of share repurchases for the balance of fiscal year '22, we have nearly returned $6 billion between share repurchases and dividends during the first 3 quarters of fiscal '22. Additionally, we remain committed to sustaining an attractive dividend and continue to target an earnings payout ratio of approximately 50%, which is near the top end of growth companies of our size and scale. Our commitment reflects our confidence in the strength of the business and to returning compelling cash distributions to shareholders while retaining balance sheet flexibility and funding our investments.\nIn closing, here are key takeaways for my discussion today. Our Q3 performance underscored continued strength in customer demand for Starbucks coffee across the globe balanced with our ability to execute investments despite macroeconomic and operational headwinds. Our commitment to deliver shareholder value has not wavered, and we are making the right decisions and investments today for the future of Starbucks, balancing the value we create for all stakeholders. Our acceleration of long-term growth is rooted in our ability to execute against our reinvention plan, and we're looking forward to sharing details and providing a comprehensive update on our business outlook for FY '23 and beyond at our Investor Day in September.\nAs always, the real credit for our success belongs to all of our Green Apron partners around the world who strive to deliver the best Starbucks Experience possible each and every day. They have our greatest respect and appreciation as we reinvent the next phase of Starbucks together.\nWith that, we will open the call to Q&A. Operator?"

My name is Alex, and I will be your conference operator today. I would like to welcome everyone to Starbucks Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2022 Conference Call. (Operator Instructions)\nI will now turn the call over to Tiffany Willis, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Willis, you may now begin your conference.\n\nTiffany Willis\n\nVP of Head of IR, Starbucks Corporation\n\nGood afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss Starbucks' second quarter fiscal year 2022 results.

For calendar planning purposes, please note that our third quarter fiscal year 2022 earnings conference call has been tentatively scheduled for Tuesday, August 2, 2022.\nAnd with that, allow me to turn the call over to Howard.\n\nHoward D. Schultz\n\nCEO, Founder & Director, Starbucks Corporation\n\nThank you, Tiffany. Love and responsibility brought me back to Starbucks. My love of the company and my deep responsibility for our partners and shareholders. In the month I've been back, I've traveled the country and met with thousands of Starbucks retail store partners and visited all 5 of our roasting plants, and I've learned firsthand about the unique challenges confronting the company today.\nI've also experienced the passionate relationship our partners have with the company and the enduring emotional connection our customers have to the Starbucks brand. COVID presented unprecedented operating challenges to consumer brands. COVID also drove dramatic changes in customer behavior that Starbucks stores and systems were not designed or built for. The challenges have been amplified by record demand for Starbucks coffee in our U.S. stores that has accelerated with the lifting of COVID restrictions.\nOur Q2 results tell the story. In Q2, our sales comp in North America grew 12% over last year, 23% compared to Q2 2020. Both drive-thru and Mobile Order & Pay activity have surged, together now generating over 70% of our U.S. store volume. Delivery, a nearly $500 million business, was up 30% in the first half of fiscal year. And in our stores, customers are increasingly further customizing already complex handcrafted cold beverages.\nThe combination of shifts and customer patterns, accelerating demand and algorithms built for different customer behaviors has placed tremendous strain on our U.S. store partners. Ordinarily, we would have anticipated and invested ahead of the shifts we're seeing, but COVID disruptions interfered with our ability to make the required investments in store design, operations, infrastructure and technology to do so.\nAs a result, we've been unable to meet the relentless demand we're seeing in our U.S. stores as seamlessly as our customers and partners expect and candidly deserve. Simply said, we do not, today, have the adequate capacity to meet the growing demand for Starbucks coffees.\nGoing forward, we will be making investments in our partners and business to literally catch up on investments we have not made and make further investments to position the company ahead of the coming growth curve. We will also be accelerating our new store growth with 90% of new stores being high-returning drive-throughs. Our newest class of drive-throughs will integrate new store designs, technology, including more handheld devices and equipment improvements that will increase efficiency, speed of service, and, we believe, deliver even greater profitability in the future. We will then incorporate the new technologies and equipment into our existing stores and provide our people with the tools and resources they need to elevate the Starbucks Experience we deliver to our customers and create even more demand in the future.\nAnd we'll be making significant investments to extend our digital capabilities and deepen our digital connection to customers and the emotional attachment our customers have to the Starbucks brand. Returns on our digital investments are consistently among the highest returns we generate, which brings us to the decision we will revisit in fiscal '23 to suspend stock buybacks. Buying back stock yields us, on average, about a 10% return. With Starbucks' treasure trove of global assets, a 10% return is not satisfactory to me. Throughout our history, the investments we have made in our people and business have always delivered outsized returns to our shareholders.\nWe're so eager to show off our pipeline of disruptive innovation that we're moving our Investor Day up to September in Seattle from December in New York. With significant innovation around technology and personalization we will reveal our industry game-changers that will further increase store productivity and efficiency. What you will see is the coming transformation and reimagination of the Starbucks customer and partner experiences.\nThe transformation will accelerate already record demand in our stores, but the investments will enable us to handle the increased demand and deliver increased profitability, while also delivering an elevated experience to our customers and most importantly, reducing strain on our partners. We must reintroduce joy in the customer and emotional connection back into the partner experience.\nWe've identified over $200 million of investment that's incremental to the significant investments we've already committed to in our U.S. company-operated stores this year. These include further investments in training, wage and equipment and new investments in internal communication with our people, where we will launch a new partner app to communicate directly with all store partners.\nWe will also be reaffirming our commitment to coffee excellence and partner education by reintroducing our Black Apron, Coffee Master and Origin Trip programs. And in 2023, we will introduce enhanced digital tipping for our partners. We believe these investments will improve retention and recruiting and elevate the experience we deliver to our partners and our customers.\nOver the last month, we've realigned Starbucks U.S. organization to focus entirely on transforming and reimagining our core U.S. business. Belinda Wong will share plans for accelerated growth in China as soon as COVID-related mobility restrictions there are lifted. And make no mistake, our aspirations around China have never been greater and I remain convinced Starbucks' business in China will be eventually larger than our business in the U.S.\nWe have a big breakthrough idea around the launch of Starbucks Web 3.0 and a unique platform for NFTs that Brady Brewer and Adam Brotman, architect of Mobile Order & Pay and the Starbucks digital app, who is serving as a special adviser to us, will shortly tell you about. I believe Web 3.0 will create an authentic digital third place experience and drive substantial new revenue streams for Starbucks and be accretive to the brand.\nOur Web 3.0 strategy is a proxy for the greater ambition we have for the company going forward. Despite the fact that post COVID, our customers are not using our stores the same way, and we've been operationally challenged as a result, our national retail footprint and best-in-class real estate portfolio is still enabling us to meet customers wherever they are and irrespective of their needs state. This relentless demand we're seeing in our stores today underscores this reality.\nLooking ahead, try to imagine thousands of vastly more productive and efficient Starbucks stores reconfigured to align with today's customer behavior and built around technology that will deliver increased speed of service, improved labor management and reduced unit cost, an elevated partner and customer experience. Now imagine the accretive impact to our financials when we reengineer our stores to deliver what we're capable of in delivering and arming our people with the tools and resources they need to once again exceed our customers' expectations.\nFrom my perspective, I understand what's needed, and I'm back to lead this transformation and committed to seeing it through. Starbucks sits alone with something few, if any, of our peers literally have, and that is unmet demand. Companies spend hundreds of millions of dollars on marketing, promotions and social media trying to create demand. We have demand everywhere we look, despite having not lived up to the expectations we set for ourselves, let alone exceeding the expectations of our customers and our people since the pandemic.\nThe big opportunity ahead for us is to meet strong and growing demand in our stores more efficiently and effectively and to leverage technology to enhance productivity and reduce burden on our store partners.\nLet me highlight just a few sources of the accelerating demand we're seeing in our U.S. stores and business. Mobile Order & Pay, an over $4 billion business, is up 400% in 5 years, is up 20% over last year. Our $500 million delivery business is up 30% over last year. The Starbucks Card puts our brand in the hands of nearly 120 million people and is alone larger than the entire gift card category. Starbucks customers are increasingly prepaying for their purchases in huge volumes, roughly $11 billion last year, and we are on track to exceed that figure this year.\nAt this moment, well over $1 billion is loaded on Starbucks Cards waiting to be spent in our stores. And active Starbucks Rewards membership in the U.S. grew 17% over last year to Q2 to 27 million members. Strong underlying demand means the productivity and efficiency investments I've described represent literally low-hanging fruit available to us right now.\nIn every sense, Starbucks remains a growth company today and will remain a growth company into the future. Two related dynamics underscore the power of the equity of the Starbucks brand and support our growth aspirations: consistent pricing power and strong demand for Starbucks products in CPG channels. Over the last year, we raised prices several times to address increasing inflationary pressures. Yet, we experienced negligible customer attrition, once again demonstrating the elasticity of demand for Starbucks coffee.\nEven so, inflationary pressures have outpaced our price increases, resulting in several points of margin compression in the short term and costing us over 200 basis points in the first half of the fiscal year. In Q2, we were able to absorb the incremental cost while still delivering on our EPS expectations.\nIn our channels business, Starbucks today has the #1 share in the U.S. at coffee and the #1 share in global ready-to-drink coffee. Customer loyalty inside and outside our stores has never been greater. You have to ask yourself how many retail companies have a consumer brand that is best of class and literally the #1 position in grocery and in multiple channels of distribution. You'd be hard-pressed to find any. I could not be more optimistic or confident in the successful transformation and reimagination of our store partner and customer experiences.\nLet me turn to China. I cannot think of any other Western consumer brand, let alone a food and beverage retailer, that has performed as well as us in China over the last 20 years. I say that with great pride having been to China so often, building confidence, trust and respectful relationships with government officials and working closely with our Chinese team.\nHowever, the situation in China is unprecedented. Shanghai, a city 4x the size of New York City, is completely locked down. Other major cities, including Beijing, are experiencing new COVID outbreaks and implementing new mobility restrictions pursuant to China's strict zero-COVID policy.\nConditions in China are such that we have virtually no ability to predict our performance in China in the back half of the year. Given the materiality and the high level of ongoing uncertainty around China, accelerating inflation and the significant investments we are planning, the only responsible course of action for us to take is to suspend guidance for Q3 and Q4.\nAs we move through Q3 and approach September's Investor Day, we will have much greater visibility on Q4, holiday and fiscal '23, and be in a position to share details around our comprehensive post-COVID China plan with you.\nI'm very pleased with the growth we're seeing from our international business. Excluding China, our International segment grew comps in the double digits in the quarter, stronger than anticipated, demonstrating the strength of our diversified portfolio and the opportunity ahead. Even including the impact of China, our International segment still grew 4% in the quarter over last year to a record $1.7 billion.\nOur international store base grew 9% over last year to over 17,700 stores. [15%] of that growth was in licensed markets. We expect 75% of the net new stores we will open in fiscal '22 to be outside the U.S., further underscoring the enormous global and the opportunity ahead.\nNow let me turn to a subject in the news. Across America, there is a movement in the media and across multiple industries, including the service sector, whereby fellow citizens have begun turning to labor unions as a means of gaining voice, representation and improved working conditions. This movement is not related to any specific company.\nWe are highly emphatic to the root causes of the frustration and anxieties that Gen Z Americans are facing, having come of age during turbulent moments in our history: the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, The Great Recession and now The Global Coronavirus Pandemic. These young people have completely valid concerns given today's uncertainty and economic instability. They look around and they see the burgeoning labor movement as a possible remedy to what they are feeling.\nI understand the climate, and I'm deeply sensitive to the needs of all of our Green Apron partners. Yet, we have a very different and vastly more positive vision for our company based on listening, connecting and collaborating directly with our people.\nThroughout our history at Starbucks, we have led our industry, and in many cases, corporate America, in introducing breakthrough benefits for our people. Aon Hewitt, the gold standard in benefits, rates Starbucks in the 100th percentile in the retail sector, the 100th percentile, including from part-time workers who want stability and flexibility to achieve their future aspirations. That means no retail company in America ranks above Starbucks for the benefits we provide our people. We are proud of our history and leadership in wages and benefits, and we are committed to doing even more to meet the evolving needs of our Starbucks partners in the future.\nSharing success through wins and benefits with our partners is among our core values, and has been for 50 years, and our values are not and never have been the result of demands or interference from any outside entity. It's who we are, it's who we have been and who we always will be. Compare any union contract in our sector to the constantly expanding list of wages and benefits we have provided our people for decades and the union contract will not even come close to what Starbucks offers. We remain committed to doing the right thing for each and every Starbucks partner and that includes respect for differing opinions, inclusion and embracing diversity and individuality.\nToday, we take further steps to modernize our pay and benefits vision for our partners with further investments in wage, barista skills training, coffee excellence and financial wellness and literacy. And in September, we will share additional initiatives we are planning for Starbucks partners in areas that include help with student loan refinancing, additional skills recognition programs enhanced in-app tipping and new profit-haring initiatives.\nPartners at Starbucks U.S. company-operated stores, where we have the right to unilaterally make these changes, will receive these wages and benefit enhancements. This covers more than 240,000 Starbucks partners and roughly 8,800 Starbucks stores across the country.\nWe do not have the same freedom to make these improvements at locations that have a union or where union organizing is underway. Partners in those stores will receive the wages increases that were announced in October 21, but Federal law prohibits us from promising new wages and benefits at stores involved in union organizing. And by law, we cannot implement unilateral changes at stores that have a union. Where Starbucks is required to engage in collective bargaining, we will negotiate in good faith. Starbucks will not favor or discriminate against any partner based on union issues. And we will respect the right of Starbucks partners to make their own decisions when exercising these rights.\nA question I get asked frequently is how long are you going to stay? So let me try and preempt it here. I've just framed the enthusiasm and the optimism I have for our transformation plan going forward. We have line of sight on what the transformation looks like and how meaningfully our plan will benefit the company and our people as together we co-create and reimagine the future chapters of Starbucks' storied history. The plan I shared is being designed mindfully and strategically and will be executed successfully. This I can assure you.\nThe Board and I have agreed I will stay to help transition our next leader. We are driving towards naming the new leader in the fall. After joining the company, he or she will undergo full immersion and have the opportunity to collaborate with me for a defined but not indefinite period. The plan is for me to completely hand over the CEO reins sometime in the first calendar quarter of '23 and to thereafter remain on the Starbucks Board.\nOver the last 50 years, we have built Starbucks into one of the most recognized and respected brands in the world. And we have delivered best-in-class returns to our shareholders since being a public company in 1992. The investments in our people and our company we discuss today will absolutely assure that despite our success in the past, our best days are ahead.\nWe're looking forward to demonstrating what's ahead and the enthusiasm we have to sharing that with you on our Investor Day in September.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Belinda. Belinda?\n\nChing Ying Wong\n\nChairman & CEO of Starbucks China, Starbucks Corporation\n\nThank you, Howard. While we are into the third year of navigating through COVID in China, in Q2, we encountered the most severe resurgence of the virus to date. 72% of the 225 cities we're in experienced Omicron outbreaks, including Shanghai and Shenzhen. With this more infectious variant, mobility restrictions and lockdowns are imposed faster and relaxed more cautiously.\nStarbucks' focus since the start of the pandemic has been to protect the health and well-being of our partners and customers, provide support and show up positively in our communities. Our efforts have deepened our connection to customers and made our partners proud.\nOver the last 2 years, we have built up muscle and agility to navigate through COVID challenges. With every resurgence, we add new chapters to our China COVID playbook, strengthening our capabilities and resilience. As we moved into Q3 and continuing today, roughly 1/3 of our stores remain temporarily closed or are offering delivery or MOP only. And most of our remaining stores are operating under strict safety protocols that interfere with our traffic and operations.\nAs a result, net revenue in China declined 14% and sales comp declined 20% in Q2 versus last year, after adjusting for the VAT subsidy, all from reduced traffic. We expect an even greater impact on our Q3 results due to the timing of the Shanghai lockdown and a further resurgence of the virus in other cities, including Beijing. We expect mobility restrictions to continue under the country's zero-COVID policy for the foreseeable future.\nIn Q2, we continue to invest to increase our digital connection to customers. As a result, digital mix now represents a record 43% of sales. Our launch of Starbucks Delivers on Meituan in January has driven incrementality and make Starbucks the coffee category leader on third-party delivery platforms.\nWe remain laser-focused on our growth as we manage through short-term challenges. At our China Investor Day in 2018, we shared our aspiration to operate 6,000 stores in China by 2022. Despite years of COVID disruptions, we remain on track to do so, adding 97 net new stores in Q2, with our new stores continuing to deliver best-in-class returns and profitability.\nWe also continue to invest in smart technologies to improve our productivity and efficiency, leverage our scale and deliver an elevated experience to our partners and customers. We're extremely proud that despite COVID challenges, we achieved our highest-ever customer connection score in March.\nThe enduring loyalty and connection our customers have to the Starbucks brand sets us apart from all competitors. Today, 1 in 2 coffee consumers in China choose Starbucks over any other coffee retail brand, a huge lead that we have held for years and continue to build upon.\nOur dreams and aspirations for Starbucks China have never been greater, and I'm incredibly proud of what we have accomplished in China while managing through the pandemic. Our accomplishments are due to the extraordinary dedication and efforts of our 70,000 partners. No coffee retailer in China is better positioned than Starbucks to navigate the current headwinds on or to resume accelerated growth once COVID mobility restrictions are lifted.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Brady. Brady?\n\nBrady Brewer\n\nExecutive VP & CMO, Starbucks Corporation\n\nThank you, Belinda. Starbucks is one of the most sought-after brands in the world. And by engaging deeply with our customers over 50 years, we've amassed a treasure trove of assets, both physical and digital. Just one example being the nearly 27 million active Starbucks Rewards members in the U.S. We're activating these unique brand assets as a catalyst to accelerate the future of Starbucks as a global brand and as a business.\nFrom our beginning, we've nurtured human connection and served a fundamental belief that coffee brings us together. We brought this to life in what we've called the third place, a place between home and work, where you could connect and feel a sense of belonging over coffee.\nNow we are extending the third place concept of Starbucks into a new kind of community. Emerging technologies associated with Web 3, and specifically NFTs, now enable this aspiration and allow us to extend who Starbucks has always been at our core.\nWe are creating the digital third place. To achieve this, we will broaden our framework of what it means for people to be a member of the Starbucks community, adding new concepts such as ownership and community-based membership models that we see developing in the Web 3 space.",
        "content2": "We will lead by aligning our initiatives with our sustainability commitments, making deliberate choices to build the community on environmentally sustainable Web 3 platforms. Imagine acquiring a new digital collectible from Starbucks, where that product also serves as your access pass to a global Starbucks community, one with engaging content experiences and collaboration all centered around coffee.\nThis community will further strengthen the Starbucks brand, engage our partners and we expect it to be accretive to our business. Starbucks has the history of taking leading-edge technology and innovation and making it accessible and approachable to the mainstream. You've seen it with our digital experiences, whether it was introducing ability to pay with your phone, mobile order or even access WiFi long ago. Starbucks can serve as a bridge to the future for our nearly 100 million customer occasions per week around the world.\nWe'll take our first step toward a digital third place and our broad vision for Web 3 with an anticipated launch in this year. This is just the beginning of an exciting future.\nNow I'll turn it over to Rachel.\n\nRachel Ruggeri\n\nExecutive VP, CFO & Principal Accounting Officer, Starbucks Corporation\n\nThank you, Brady, and good afternoon, everyone. As Howard mentioned, Starbucks' performance in Q2 demonstrated strong customer demand across our portfolio despite continuing COVID headwinds. We delivered global revenue of $7.6 billion in Q2, up 15% from the prior year, a second quarter record.\nOur results were primarily driven by 18% revenue growth in the U.S. and stellar performance across our diverse global portfolio. We are particularly pleased with the strong results in light of the dynamic environment.\nQ2 consolidated operating margin contracted 300 basis points from the prior year to 13%, primarily due to inflation, which increased over the course of the quarter, significant investments in store partner wages and benefits and reduced traffic in China. The margin contraction was partially offset by pricing in North America. Q2 EPS was $0.59, declining 3% from the prior year, consistent with our expectations.\nI will now provide some segment highlights for Q2. North America delivered revenue of $5.4 billion in Q2, up 17% from the prior year and also a Q2 record, primarily driven by a 12% increase in comparable store sales comprised of a 7% increase in average ticket and a 5% increase in transactions. Strong performance of new stores over the past 12 months and the accelerated recovery of our licensed stores also contributed to this compelling level of revenue growth.\nU.S. comparable store sales were 12% despite significant store hour modifications in the early part of the quarter. The sustained momentum across our cold platform and food attached, coupled with the return of winter favorites and newer offerings such as the Pistachio Latte all contributed to these strong results.\nOur average ticket continued to grow, reaching an all-time high, driven by strategic beverage pricing and another record-breaking quarter of food attach with food sales increasing 25% from the prior year. We continue to engage with customers where and how they prefer, as our drive-through windows, mobile order and delivery channels collectively accounted for 75% of U.S. company-operated sales in Q2. These convenient order channels and compelling product offerings cannot be easily replicated at home.\nOur customers continue to make Starbucks a part of their daily routine, fueling growth across all dayparts and drive-throughs and cafes with specific strength in suburban and rural areas. Underpinning the enduring demand is our continued focus on digital customer engagement with Starbucks Rewards members delivering 54% of the revenue in our U.S. company-operated stores, the highest level of engagement on record, up 2 percentage points from the prior year.\nNorth America's operating margin was 17.2% in Q2, contracting 260 basis points from the prior year due to inflation, investments in labor, including enhanced store partner wages and new partner training as well as the lapping of prior year government subsidies. These margin headwinds were partially offset by pricing and sales leverage.\nThroughout the quarter, we executed our plan to offset near-term margin pressures by accelerating price increases, reducing spend in discretionary cost areas and activating throughput initiatives across our operations. These actions helped the company deliver Q2 profitability as planned despite higher-than-expected COVID isolation pay and ongoing inflationary headwinds, which increased considerably over the course of the quarter.\nMoving on to International. The segment delivered its highest second quarter revenue ever, reaching $1.7 billion, up 4% over the prior year despite the impacts of COVID-19 lockdowns in China. The growth was primarily driven by a 9% increase in net new stores over the past 12 months and strong sales growth from our international licensees, including the conversion of our Korean market to a fully licensed business.\nGrowth was partially offset by an 8% decline in comparable store sales, including a 3% decline attributable to the lapping prior year VAT benefit as well as a 3% unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. Excluding the VAT impact, international comparable store sales declined 5%. And excluding China, international comparable store sales increased meaningfully.\nShifting to China. As you're aware, and as Belinda discussed, China continues to battle COVID resurgences and navigate through prolonged lockdowns. Although China's comparable store sales improved sequentially in January, traffic lessened considerably in February and March as Omicron cases surged and lockdowns were implemented, leading to a comparable store sales decline of nearly 50% in the last week of March as we exited the quarter. As a result, second quarter comparable store sales declined 23% in the market or 20% excluding an impact of lapping the prior year VAT relief.\nAt the end of Q2, roughly 1/3 of our stores in China remains temporarily closed or offered mobile ordering channels only. A sizable number of these stores were high-volume stores located in Tier 1 cities, including Shanghai, with the balance of active stores operating under elevated COVID safety protocols. Despite the considerable near-term headwinds, we remain focused on executing against our growth strategy in China.\nAs Belinda shared, given our portfolio's healthy fundamentals, expanding digital footprint and record customer connection, coupled with vast opportunity ahead, we remain very optimistic for our future growth in China.\nOutside of China, the recovery of our international markets gained momentum across our global portfolio in Q2, with many of our licensed markets achieving record revenue levels in the quarter with revenue growth for the segment outside of China reaching 23%, once again demonstrating the underlying health of our business as mobility restrictions subside.\nOperating margins for the International segment was 13.1% in Q2, down 600 basis points from the prior year, mainly driven by strategic and partner investments lapping higher prior year COVID relief, including government subsidies as well as higher product and distribution costs from sales mix shift, partially offset by sales leverage across the P&L.\nStrong performance of our international markets outside of China helped offset the significant sales deleverage in China. As the adverse impact from China lockdowns intensified in the last few weeks of Q2 and amplified further as we entered Q3, we expect China's results to continue to be a headwind throughout the current quarter.\nMoving on to Channel Development. The segment's revenue grew 25% to $463 million in Q2, primarily driven by growth in the Global Coffee Alliance as well as the strength in our international ready-to-drink business. The segment continued to amplify the Starbucks brand, led by the growth of our U.S. at-home coffee under the Global Coffee Alliance, which continued to see strong performance driven by Starbucks by Nespresso platform, fueled by the Vertuo line.\nWe had exciting innovation launches in our ready-to-drink business, including Starbucks BAYA Energy in the U.S. and new Chilled Cup offerings in our international markets. The segment's operating margin was 42.7% in Q2, down 400 basis points from the prior year, primarily due to business mix shift driven by growth in the Global Coffee Alliance.\nMoving on to our guidance for the balance of our fiscal '22 year. Given the uncertainty around further mobility restrictions and lockdowns in China resulting from the government's strict zero-COVID policies as well as increasing inflationary headwinds, it's become increasingly difficult for us to predict the back half of the year with reasonable accuracy. Thus, as Howard mentioned, we believe the only responsible thing to do is suspend guidance for balance of this fiscal year.\nHowever, to provide additional insights, we believe our results for the balance of the year will be significantly pressured with heavier pressure in Q3. From a capital allocation perspective, although we suspended share repurchases for the balance of the fiscal year, we've returned more than $5 billion between share repurchases and our quarterly dividend during the first half of our fiscal year. We expect share repurchases made earlier in the year to contribute at least 1% to our FY '22 EPS growth. We will provide a comprehensive update on our business outlook and our capital allocation commitments for FY '23 and beyond at our Investor Day in September. However, as Howard mentioned, we are confident the investments we are making in our partners, our stores and our brand will deliver significant returns in excess of historical levels, resulting in accelerated long-term growth.\nTo summarize, the 2 key takeaways from my prepared remarks today. Our Q2 performance underscored the strong customer demand across our business and around the world. We remain committed to the growth opportunity ahead in all channels and markets, creating and delivering exceptional value to all our stakeholders, our partners, our customers and our shareholders long into the future.\nOnce again, the real credit for our success belongs to our Green Apron partners around the world who continue to go above and beyond to deliver an elevated Starbucks Experience every day. That experience drove our growth and will continue to be the heart of our business as we reimagine the future of Starbucks together.\nWith that, Howard, Belinda, Brady and I are happy to take your questions, joined by John Culver, Michael Conway and Adam Brotman. Thank you.\nOperator?"
