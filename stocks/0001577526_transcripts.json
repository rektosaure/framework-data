Welcome to Logitech's video call to discuss our financial results for the First Quarter of Fiscal Year 2025. Joining us today are Hanneke Faber, our CEO; and Meeta Sunderwala, our Interim CFO. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, including with respect to future operating results under the safe harbor of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We're making these statements based on our views only as of today.\nOur actual results could differ materially. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any of these statements. We will also discuss non-GAAP financial results, and you can find a reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results and information about our use of non-GAAP measures and factors that could impact our financial results and forward-looking statements in our press release and in our filings with the SEC. These materials as well as a shareholder letter and a webcast of this call are all available at the Investor Relations page of our website.\nWe encourage you to review these materials carefully. Unless noted otherwise, comparisons between periods are year-over-year and in constant currency and net sales. This call is being recorded and will be available for a replay on our website. I will now turn the call over to Hanneke.\n\nJohanna W. Faber\n\nPresident of Foods & Refreshment, Unilever PLC\n\nThank you, Nate, and welcome, everyone, to our first earnings call of our 2025 fiscal year. Pleased to say that we started the year off strong. We delivered 13% year-over-year growth and 430 basis points of margin expansion, while generating strong levels of cash further bolstering our balance sheet. Given the healthy momentum in our business to market share gains we've seen in most of our key product categories and the confidence in our ability to execute, we are raising our fiscal '25 outlook, which I'll touch on shortly. You can read the full details of our quarter and our shareholder letter, which will give you a full review of our operating and financial performance.\nBut I'd like to spend a few minutes on this call to provide some color in context to our results. and then we'll transition to Q&A. Let me briefly touch on 3 points. First, I'm super pleased to see Q1 net sales growth in the low teens, our second consecutive quarter of growth. As a reminder, we told you last quarter that our strategic -- that strategic working capital investments would be a part of this story this quarter as we prepared our own end channel inventories for big selling seasons like June 18, Amazon Prime, back-to-school and into the holiday season. Even after you normalize for these planned channel investments, demand was nearly 1/3 of our top line growth.\nThe teams delivered on our plans exceptionally well. Together with our strong top line results and our focus on execution and operational discipline, we drove healthy growth in operating margin expansion. These results were also enabled by our ability to balance the needs of our distribution partners with continued focus on lean working capital management. At the end of Q1, our owned inventory was down nearly 20% from last year, and our Q1 inventory turns were at 5.4%, with a notable increase from 4.2% last year. demonstrating our strong command of the business. And our channel inventory levels in terms of weeks on hand remain well within the upper and lower ranges in which we've operated since the beginning of fiscal year '24.\nSecond, I'm excited about our product innovation lineup for this fiscal year, advancing our strategic priority that I talked about last quarter to innovate. You saw us launch 11 products in the first quarter across almost all of our product categories. This ability to launch a diversified set of innovations with a design-led focus at global scale, is a competitive advantage that we will continue to leverage. Many of these products are finding smart ways to leverage the power of AI. And for example, the recently released AI pronged builder has now been used in over 5.5 million instances. And our recently introduced MeetUp 2 conference camera with Rightside and Rightsound technologies, leverages proprietary data models, our own and machine learning algorithms to deliver a truly equitable meeting experience for those in the meeting room or participating remotely.\nThird, given our solid start to the year, we are updating our fiscal year '25 outlook, modestly increasing our fiscal '25 targets for both net sales and non-GAAP operating income. Fiscal year '25 net sales growth is now expected to be between 1% and 3%, and non-GAAP operating income is expected to be between $700 million and $730 million. This updated fiscal '25 outlook contemplates 2 discrete trends. Our top line growth in Q1 was clearly strong. End customer demand, coupled with the working capital investments I discussed earlier drove a healthy increase in net sales. At the same time though, this positive business momentum occurred amidst the uncertain and volatile global economic backdrop. So while we're pleased with our first quarter results, we remain pragmatic about future risks and uncertainties.\nNow before we move to Q&A, I'd just like to highlight our 2024 impact report that we published yesterday. You've heard us talk about our commitment to sustainability, and this annual scorecard holds us accountable. There's a lot to be proud of in this report, such as the fact that 3 out of 4 of our products now use recycled plastic and 66% of our products are carbon [ late, ] helping consumers and enterprise technology buyers make informed decisions about the environmental impact of their purchases, sorry. I'm very comfortable with this approach to sustainability. We set ambitious goals and provide an annual transparent scorecard. And above all, we pursue this commitment to sustainability while delivering strong business results.\nSo in summary, I'm pleased with our ability to execute on our strategic priorities as we focus on extending human potential in work and play. Our first quarter results demonstrate that we're on the right track. Thank you. And with that, Nate, let's go to Q&A."

Welcome to Logitech's video call to discuss our financial results for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2024. Joining us today are Hanneke Faber, our CEO; and Chuck Boynton, our CFO. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, including with respect to future operating results under the safe harbor of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We're making these statements based on our views only as of today. Our actual results could differ materially, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any of these statements.\nWe will also discuss non-GAAP financial results.

This call is being recorded and will be available for a replay on our website.\nI will now turn the call over to Hanneke.\n\nJohanna W. Faber\n\nPresident of Foods & Refreshment, Unilever PLC\n\nThank you, Nate, and welcome, everyone. In today's call, we're going to cover 3 items, all of which are detailed in the shareholder letter that we released with our earnings materials. First, Chuck will provide the highlights of our fourth quarter and our full year results. I'll then briefly touch on my view of our current assets, the secular trends driving the business and strategic decisions that we're implementing. And I'm going to close with our financial outlook. Let me start, though, by saying how pleased I am about the execution of our teams in the fourth quarter.\nWe returned to top line growth. We executed at a very high level with both gross and operating margins up year-over-year. And before Chuck dives into the numbers, I want to thank him for an impactful tenure here at Logitech. He's built a highly capable finance team, and he has helped drive the consistent progress we've seen in the business over the last year. He's going to be missed, and we wish him all the best. And now Chuck, over to you.\n\nCharles D. Boynton\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, SunPower Corp.\n\nWell, thank you, Hanneke, and thank you all for joining us on the call today. I am so proud of the way our employees finished the year. In addition to further enhancing the value chain, we continued our cost reductions and promotional discipline. These factors all drove better-than-expected fourth quarter results. The detailed financial results can be found in the press release and in the shareholder letter, but I'd like to call your attention to 3 metrics.\nFirst, we are pleased to see Q4 revenue return to growth at plus 5%. However, please note that channel inventory reduction in Q4 was lower than last year's reduction. When normalized for the change in channel inventory, net sales growth was closer to plus 3%. Second, our Q4 non-GAAP gross margin of 43.6% was better than expected due to lower product costs, lower inventory reserves and reduced promotional activities. For the year, we achieved non-GAAP gross margin of 41.8%, a tremendous accomplishment by the team and comfortably within the range of our operating model. And finally, the business continues to generate impressive cash flow. In Q4, we delivered $239 million of operating cash flow, totaling over $1.1 billion for the year. We returned almost $700 million to our shareholders and ended the year with a fortress balance sheet. Thank you, Hanneke, and thank you, Logitech for the opportunity to serve. It's been a real pleasure, and I will miss everyone. With that, I'll turn it back over to Hanneke. Hanneke?\n\nJohanna W. Faber\n\nPresident of Foods & Refreshment, Unilever PLC\n\nThanks, Chuck. So in my first 100 days, I've met with hundreds of employees, customers, partners and shareholders, and their passion and excitement about Logitech's future as well as their healthy [ dissatisfaction ] with the levels of top line growth of the last 2 years were palpable. And these interactions have been super helpful as I shape the plans for Logitech's future. Everything starts with our mission.\nLogitech extends human potential in work and play. Extending human potential is exciting. It means helping people be more productive, perform better, [ win that game ] and connect more easily, all in ways that are more sustainable and more equitable. We will pursue this mission with a terrific set of existing assets that we build from. We have world-class design and engineering expertise. We have a strong brand with high levels of brand awareness and leading market share positions in key product categories. We have truly global go-to-market capabilities in more than 100 countries, and we're in operations powering house with a relentless focus on cost, inventory, quality and customer service.\nNow as we look forward, we see 5 external trends that we believe will affect our business. First, new ways of working or splitting time between working at the office and home and on the go. It's here to stay, highlighting the need for multiple workspaces and the need for more video collaboration. Second, gaming has gone mainstream. Nearly every age, gender and demographic is gaming today, providing an opportunity for us to provide more tools to a wider community of gamers.\nThird, we're in the early innings of a major AI transformation. And Logitech will be and already is an important part of the emerging AI ecosystem. Fourth, climate change is impacting every country, every business and every society. Logitech intends to continue to be a leader for sustainability and tech. And the final trend is the increasing importance of trust. In a world where trusting government, the media, science and in business is at an all-time low, Logitech delivers trusted experiences with assets like our well-established Swiss brand and high privacy and security standards, we are very well positioned.\nI've come to really like this combination of strong assets and long-term secular tailwinds. To take advantage of them, we're in the process of implementing a number of new strategic decisions to accelerate profitable growth, where to play and how to win choices, if you will. Let me share those briefly with you. First, work and play. We will continue to innovate and grow in the core categories that we competed today, personal workspace, video collaboration and gaming. But there is more room to grow. Today in work, we're focused on office workers. Most people in the world don't sit in offices every day. They work in retail, in education, in health care, in manufacturing and construction and other places.\nAnd in play, we are mainly focused on PC gaming today. There are other play opportunities, console and mobile and even beyond what I call active play. Expanding our definitions of work and play significantly broadens our total addressable markets. Second, we will create competitive advantage through a focus on design-led, software-enabled hardware. Those words are carefully chosen. We differentiate our hardware with world-class design and with advanced software insight. Third, we will double down on the B2B, the business-to-business channel.\nOur B2B business is twice as big as it was in 2019, but I would still call us relatively young in this channel, further strengthening our B2B capabilities and domain expertise offers significant opportunities for future growth. Fourth, we will build out our already strong global presence. We will reply best practices to drive a more consistent share of wallet across our developed markets and further extend our presence in emerging markets. Combined, these geographic opportunities represent more than $1 billion of incremental growth.\nAnd fifth, we will focus on building the Logitech brands and take it from good to truly iconic that single Logitech brand. That's where to play. Now how will we win? We will relentlessly drive product superiority through innovation. We will build on our reputation for operational excellence and discipline, and we will continue our industry-leading work to reduce carbon emissions across our value chain.\nNow let me turn to the outlook and what this set of choices means for the near-term and longer-term profile of our business. Our first priority is to return the business to annualized growth in fiscal '25. We are targeting low single-digit growth with strong operating margins. Our goal in the midterm is to return organic growth to mid-single digits. Potential acquisitions would be incremental to that. We believe this growth supported by non-GAAP gross margins in the 39% to 44% range and non-GAAP operating margins of 14% to 17% represents an attractive investment profile.\nIn summary, the path ahead builds on Logitech's impressive set of strengths, takes advantage of secular trends and makes a number of clear strategic choices going forward. With that combination, I'm confident that Logitech's future is bright and its best days are still ahead.\nThank you. Before we now move to Q&A, one final administrative comment. We spoke last quarter about our plans to host an Analyst and Investor Day in May. With Chuck moving on to a new opportunity, we thought it prudent to modify our plans. We will host a more traditional AID later in the year with the exact timing to follow. And with that, Nate, let's move to Q&A."

Faber\n\nPresident of Foods & Refreshment, Unilever PLC\n\n[Audio Gap]\nThank you, Nate, and welcome, everyone. I'm very excited to be here today for my first earnings call at Logitech. Now you've probably noticed that this quarter, we introduced a new document as part of our earnings material, a shareholder letter. This letter is intended to be a comprehensive review of our quarterly results and includes commentary that previously would have been covered at the beginning of the call. So today, after brief opening remarks, we will move directly into Q&A. Now let's move on to this quarter.\nOur team delivered really solid results in the third quarter. and I am proud of the product innovation, the share gains, the operational discipline and the prudent financial management throughout the quarter, resulting in really healthy gross margins and exceptional cash flow generation.\nOur dis execution, tightly managing costs and promotional spend drove a 22% increase in our operating margin. That is tremendous work by all of our teams. We will not be satisfied, of course, until we return to top line growth, which will be a gradual process. As we look forward, I am delighted with Logitech's positioning.\nOur portfolio is designed to take advantage of indisputable trends in hybrid work, video conferencing, gaming and content creation. And disruptive technologies like AI will provide additional opportunities for us. As we work our way back to growth, we have demonstrated consistent, disciplined operational excellence that builds a highly cash-generative P&L and a very strong balance sheet.\nThis discipline, coupled with an innovation engine that introduces new products at a global scale, drives our market leadership across multiple categories. I've spent the last 2 months visiting with our employees, partners, customers and shareholders. It's been a really exciting time for me, and I am as optimistic about Logitech's future as when I joined on day one.\nWe will be hosting an Analyst and Investor Day later this spring, and I'll provide you with a more detailed perspective on our strategy and our approach to capital allocation then. Additionally, we will then provide our outlook for fiscal year 2025. I really look forward to seeing you all at that event. Thanks again. And let me turn it to Chuck to discuss the numbers. Chuck?\n\nCharles D. Boynton\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, SunPower Corp.\n\nThank you, Hanneke. Thank you all for joining us on the call today. You've seen our detailed financial results in the press release and shareholder letter, but I'd like to highlight 3 metrics this quarter that really stand out. First, our gross margins of 42.3% were better than expected year-over-year due to lower product and logistics costs, reduced promotional activities, specifically in North America.\nSecond, we've spoken for several quarters about our focus on driving lean operations. For the seventh consecutive quarter, we reduced on-hand inventory. And this quarter, it was down 44% year-over-year with our inventory turns hitting 6.5%. And finally, in Q3, we delivered $443 million of operating cash flow, one of our best ever. This was driven by an improvement in the cash conversion cycle and strong operating margins.\nWe are updating our outlook for the full year. We are now expecting revenues of $4.2 billion to $4.25 billion, up from $4 billion to $4.15 billion. Our operating income is expected to be between $610 million and $660 million, up from $525 million to $575 million. One final note regarding fiscal year 2025. If you look at our last 4 quarters as well as the midpoint of our fiscal Q2 '24 outlook, you will see the declines in our net sales have moderated.\nLooking ahead to fiscal '25, we do not anticipate an inflection point in the slope of this curve while the rate of our net sales declines has improved, there are a number of headwinds and uncertainties that may impact our net sales throughout fiscal '25. Thank you to all of our employees for the hard work and impressive execution. With that, Nate, let's move on to Q&A."

Welcome to Logitech's video call to discuss our financial results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2024. Joining us today are Guy Gecht, our Interim CEO; and Chuck Boynton, our CFO.\nDuring this call, we will make forward-looking statements including with respect to future operating results under the safe harbor of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We're making these statements based on our views only as of today and our actual results could differ materially.\nWe undertake no obligation to update or revise any of these statements.

We encourage you to review these materials carefully. Unless noted otherwise, comparisons between periods are year-over-year and in constant currency in that sales. This call is being recorded and will be available for replay on our website.\nOne brief note before we move on to the quarterly results. Next quarter, we will plan to update and modernize our earnings materials. The totality of the information we provide today will not change.\nI'll now turn the call over to Guy. Guy?\n\nGuy Gecht\n\nDirector & Interim CEO\n\nThank you, Nate. And thank you all for joining us today. I'm very proud of the Logitech's team performance and execution this quarter, driving better than expected results despite continued challenges, especially in Asia. Our new products combined with sales execution led to significant progress toward the return to growth. And we did it while delivering record operating and gross margins exceeding any time in our history outside of the big pandemic periods along with OpEx control coming in slightly better than our 25% target.\nWhile we pause to congratulate the team and indeed they deserve a huge thank you for the results, you will not find here any complacency, especially not before we return to healthy growth. That may take time as we work through pandemic portfolio demand, but we are actively working toward it.\nLooking longer term, I'm confident about Logitech's positioning. Our portfolio aligns with doable secular trends and hybrid work, video conferencing, gaming and content creation that will continue playing out and we see no reason to why we will not maintain the number one positioning Logitech currently holds in the majority of our growth categories.\nNow let me briefly comment about the state of the business in these growth categories. And then Chuck will give you a lot more color on our performance in the quarter. I'm going to jump right into the video collaboration where our results are sequentially improving, but still far from where we wanted them to be. We're still facing market-related challenges, where some customers are taking a measured approach to equipping conference rooms, focusing first on hybrid work enablement by getting the workflow back into the office. But the need for equitable video and audio is only increasing and our new Sight Tabletop camera shipped this quarter uniquely provides the best experience for hybrid meeting.\nWe expect to continue to see gradual improvement in this business and we'll be back in growth mode. Our solution for personal workspaces like keyboards and mice are on the verge of growth again. Mobile accessories and ourselves into the enterprise are areas of specific strengths this quarter. Between business interest and new consumer products, we see this category well-positioned for the holiday season.\nPC gaming improved sequentially and the year-over-year declines are moderating. Simulation and console gaming remain challenged as we work through unfavorable [ dotcoms ] [indiscernible] in FY '25. Current and upcoming products [indiscernible] across our gaming portfolio in the next several quarters will further boost us in this industry that's improving, but still not back to growth.\nOur design-led innovation was on full display this quarter. With 16 new products, we expanded the [ BOSS ] gaming portfolio with the LIGHTSPEED keyboard and SUPERLIGHT 2 mouse. We launched Logitech G Litra Beam light and 2 Yeti microphones. We also launched the first product in a new category for Logitech, the Casa Pop-Up Desk, which is an all-in-one ergonomic desk setup.\nWe also continue to introduce new AI-powered products like our Zone Wireless 2 headsets. This headset uses AI for far end noise suppression resulting in a unique 2-way noise-free cancelling experience. Products like this demonstrate how AI can improve the user experience. More broadly, Logitech sees AI as a major strategic opportunity, just as we have enabled people to be productive by accessing PC and cloud capabilities, we envision Logitech providing the interface tools people need to access and benefit from AI. As artificial intelligence transforms how people work and live, we plan for Logitech to be at the forefront, delivering the solutions that seamlessly bridge human emotions.\nThis is an exciting new frontier for us that you will hear more about in coming quarters. This quarter it wasn't just our innovation on full display, but also our commitment to climate action and equity within our recent Impact Report. We aligned with 2 major private sector initiatives for the UN Sustainable Development Goals. We firmly believe businesses play a critical role driving progress on these goals. And we are proud to foster alignment across companies.\nAs our Chief Operating Officer, Prakash, said during Climate Week in New York City, when it's come to the environment, we need progress not just pledges. Let me close with an update on our CEO search. Over the last 4 months, the Board has been conducting a global CEO search including internal and external candidates across industries and geographies.\nFrom the first days of the search, there was a tremendous interest in the opportunity that afforded the Board the chance to meet with incredibly strong, diverse and experienced candidates. Our Board masterfully led by Chairperson Wendy Becker deserves real credit for their work. You might sense from my update that we are getting closer to finalizing a decision and indeed we are. Until then, I hope you understand I will not be able to add more color to this topic.\nIn summary, this quarter, we have made real progress, but aren't satisfied. We want consistent growth and consistent financial performance and we are very focused on delivering that. Thank you again and let me turn it to Chuck to discuss the numbers. Chuck?\n\nCharles D. Boynton\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, SunPower Corp.\n\nThank you, Guy. Thank you all for joining us on the call today. I'd like to echo Guy's comments about the great focus and execution of our employees throughout the quarter. Their commitment to the customer is certainly reflected in our 16 product launches ahead of the holiday season while also demonstrating the discipline to operate the business in a responsible way and generating strong operating cash flows. Tremendous work by everyone.\nNow moving on to the business results for the second quarter. Net sales in constant currency declined by 9% to $1.06 billion. Overall, our Europe team had a very strong quarter with both sequential and year-over-year top line growth in U.S. dollars. In constant currency, we were down mildly from the prior year. Both Americas and Asia-Pacific were down year-over-year, but showed sequential growth. Our personal workplace solutions had a really great quarter while gaining market share in Keyboards and Combos, Pointing Devices and Webcams.\nOur video and Logi G business still had pressure versus more difficult comps last year. We have been talking on our earnings calls and our Investor Day about the benefits of lean on-hand and channel inventory. This quarter, we continued our progress in leaning out the supply chain. And in fact, our sales out was stronger than expected, which not only led us to over-performing in the top line, but also reducing channel inventory.\nWe are currently shipping at a fast pace, getting ready for the peak holiday season. We expect to reduce channel inventory in the March quarter to align with the seasonally lower revenue we see in Q4 as well as Q1 and Q2. Please note, this will create a negative year-over-year comparison for Q4. For the sixth consecutive quarter, we reduced on-hand inventory significantly with our inventory turns improving from 3.2 to 4.6 year-over-year. We are getting close to our target operating model of 5 turns or better.\nLastly, it's important to know that similar to last quarter, the reduction in channel inventory and on-hand inventory had a onetime positive impact on gross margins. In Q2 gross margins expanded quarter-over-quarter to 42%, better than anticipated and in the upper range of our long-term financial model.\nYear-over-year increases were driven by cost improvement, including less reliance and expedited shipping along with lower promotions partially offset by unfavorable product mix. Comparing sequentially, increases were driven by cost improvements, favorable mix as well as leverage and scale. Though we are encouraged by the gross margin improvement, Q3 gross margins are typically pressured by promotions and mix and discounting typically increases during the holiday season and our sales are more consumer-led than enterprise.\nWe expect these headwinds to be partially offset by overhead absorption. In the back half of the year, we expect gross margins to be approximately 38% or 39% based on the previously mentioned onetime benefits in Q2 and sequential headwinds. Looking further ahead, with our slightly larger scale cost reduction and lower promotions, we believe that business is positioned to structurally attain the 39% to 44% gross margin target on average, although there will be quarters where we'll be below our long-term target due to various factors such as seasonality, mix or promotions.\nOperating expenses were $261 million in the quarter in line with revenue declines down 9% year-over-year. I continue to be pleased with the team's cost focus and ability to quickly dial up or dial down OpEx based on business performance. Our long-term model is to maintain operating expenses at around 25% or less of revenue. Note that we expect OpEx to rise mildly in Q3 due to seasonality and certain onetime costs.\nOperating income was $183 million in Q2 and better than our expectations due to improved demand, strong gross margins and cost discipline. Following up on our record Q1 for cash generation, the team delivered strong Q2 cash flow from operations at $223 million, leading to a cash balance of approximately $1.2 billion.\nQ2 was also reflective of our consistent capital allocation strategy, particularly our commitment to returning capital to shareholders, which totaled approximately $276 million in Q2. In September, our shareholders approved an increase to our dividend and we returned $182 million to shareholders. And we started our new $1 billion 3-year share repurchase program that was approved in June. In the second quarter, we repurchased nearly 1.9 million shares for a total consideration of $124 million. Actual cash outflow was $94 million in the quarter with the remaining balance to be paid in Q3. Please note the shares repurchase were under both the 2020 and 2023 program.\nMoving on to our outlook, we exceeded our first half outlook on both the top and bottom lines driven by stronger than anticipated demand, lower promotional intensity and more aggressive cost reductions. Although uncertainty still exists, we remain cautiously optimistic that our business will continue to slow our rate of decline and eventually get back to growth. Therefore, we're raising the full year outlook for fiscal year 2024. We are now expecting revenue of $4 billion to $4.15 billion. Our corresponding operating income is expected to be between $525 million and $575 million.\nBefore we start Q&A, we're going to show a short video highlighting our PRO line gaming products. Nate, roll the video and then we can take Q&A.\n[Presentation]"

Joining us today are Guy Gecht, our Interim CEO; and Charles Boynton, our CFO. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, including with respect to future operating results under the safe harbor of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We're making these statements based on our views only as of today our actual results could differ materially.\nWe undertake no obligation to update or revise any of these statements. We will also discuss non-GAAP financial results, and you can find a reconciliation between non-GAAP and GAAP results and information about our use of non-GAAP measures and factors that could impact our financial results and forward-looking statements in our press release and our filings with the SEC. These materials as well as the slides and a webcast of this call are all available at the Investor Relations page of our website. We encourage you to review these materials carefully. Unless noted otherwise, comparisons between periods are year-over-year and in constant currency and net sales. This call is being recorded and will be available for a replay on our website.\nI will now turn the call over to Guy.\n\nGuy Gecht\n\nDirector & Interim CEO\n\nThanks, Nate, and thank you all for joining us. It is a pleasure to speak with you today. Before we jump into our first quarter achievements, let me provide some context regarding my role and the Board's search process for Logitech's next CEO. I'm both honored and excited to guide this iconic brand company in the near term.\nDuring my 4 years on the Board of Logitech, I have gotten very familiar with the company as I had the opportunity to serve as the Chair of Logitech Technology and Innovation Committee of the Board and to serve as a member of the Audit Committee. I view my role as an interim CEO is to provide the consistent and steady hand to the many wonderful experienced teams working hard across Logitech.\nI'm singularly focused on making progress and ensuring we do not lose any time in our ongoing execution. Our strategy remains unchanged as do the business plans that are in place. All teams are focused on executing their proven playbook. And my focus is to remove obstacles, facilitate decision-making and ensure we lose no time.\nNow a few words on the search. As we previously announced, the Board is in conducting a global CEO search, including internal and external candidates. It is progressing well. There has been a lot of interest in the opportunity, and we are pleased with the strong caliber of the candidates we are seeing. Needless to say, the Board views this decision with the utmost seriousness it deserves, and it's working diligently reviewing and interviewing candidates. Given the confidential nature of the search, I will not be able to add more color today. But rest assured that we will update you when we have news to show.\nBefore I turn it over to Chuck to review the team's progress on many important points, let me provide a few of the nonfinancial highlights of this quarter. Assuming Logitech is a global leader in design and innovation, we were awarded the industry's most prestigious [ Red Dot ] Design Team of the Year award previously awarded to companies such as Apple, Ferrari and others renowned for their design. We introduced 4 new products in the quarter, including [ Raribal Haddle ] the newest addition to Logitech's family of conference cameras that turn small meeting rooms into collaboration spaces. And design for esport athletes, our newest Logitech G [indiscernible] gaming headset feature [ graphene ] drivers for those that require precision audio technology.\nAnd in addition to the products launched last quarter, we are just about to start shipping Logitech [ site ] a table top camera with 315 degrees view capabilities, delivers a truly unique video conferencing experience. And the heart of this new system is an AI director like technology that decides which participants should be highlighted on the screen. And from which angle close of [ our ] -- this benefits both people in the conference room and especially remote participants who otherwise may feel they are not fully involved in the meeting because they're not seated around the table.\nOur sales teams closed a number of meaningful customer deals in Q1, including Honda, Kroger, TD Syntec and the Proximus group as well as the European Commission. These wins represent multiple industries in both the public and private sectors. And finally, last week, we announced the acquisition of [ Loktak ], a small tuck-in deal that is adding a differentiated technology initially in gaming and screaming and streaming and later in other areas. We will continue to screen for more deals that will help us accelerate the execution of our strategy as well as bringing our unique technology to new sets of users. These were just some of the recent highlights, although most importantly for today, is that we started our fiscal year with an encouraging set of results and an updated outlook.\nAs we move through the remainder of the fiscal year and toward our expected return to growth, you should expect to see unwavering commitment to the principles and capabilities that have become the hallmark of Logitech, innovation to capitalize on the growth trends that fuel our business, which is video everywhere, hybrid work, gaming and digital content creation, design led engineering and product innovation. [indiscernible] focus on lean manufacturing and operations and a capital allocation strategy that is focused on M&A, paying a dividend and share buyback. And we do all of that with continued commitment to our values. As an example, this week, we released our annual impact report where you can read about the progress our teams have been making in the areas of sustainability and social impact.\nWith that, I will turn it to Chuck Jack to provide the financial details of our first quarter and to review the outlook for the remainder of the year. Chuck?\n\nCharles D. Boynton\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, SunPower Corp.\n\nThank you, Guy. I also appreciate everyone joining us on the call today. First and foremost, I want to thank all of our employees for the strong execution and teamwork in the quarter. It really shows in our results, especially our strong operating cash flows. Before we get into the details on our financial performance, let me spend a minute on some reporting changes we've made to our product category classifications.\nOur slide presentation and quarterly fact sheet provide additional information as well as a 5-year set of comparables. Many of you have asked for these updates over the last several quarters so we hope that changes provide a simpler and clearer view of our business. These reclassifications do not impact our previously reported financial statements.\nMoving on to the business results for the first quarter. Net sales in constant currency declined by 15% to $974 million. Sales out was quite strong, particularly for headsets, tablet accessories and gaming. As we discussed at the Analyst Day and on the last earnings call, we believe in the benefits of lean on hand and channel inventory. For the fifth consecutive quarter, we reduced on-hand inventory significantly with our inventory turns improving to 4.2. We remain committed to our goal of improving to 5 turns or better over the next year or 2.\nLikewise, channel inventory was also reduced in the quarter, and I'm proud of the team for hitting the targets that we set. This has improved linearity and predictability. We plan to keep reducing channel inventory during the seasonally soft months of July and August and then replenish the channel in September, October and November as part of a normal build for the December quarter. Net-net, we expect channel inventory to be roughly the same at the end of Q2 as it was at the beginning. In Q1, gross margins expanded quarter-over-quarter to 39% and slightly better than anticipated as significant reductions in our on-hand inventory drove down or drove some onetime benefits in the quarter.\nOn a year-over-year basis, margins were pressured by FX and mix but partially offset by cost improvement and less reliance on expedited shipping. Again, thank you to our operations team for such amazing execution. Sequentially in Q2, we anticipate gross margins to be pressured. And as a reminder, gross margins in our December quarter have both headwinds and tailwinds. We have the seasonally higher consumer sales and holiday promotions but those are somewhat offset by overhead absorption. While there will be quarter-to-quarter fluctuations, we feel our business is structurally positioned to generate 40% gross margins in the next 4 to 6 quarters.\nOperating expenses were $271 million in the quarter, up slightly versus our internal expectations. A portion of our operating expenses were attributable to some onetime administrative expenses and the weakening U.S. dollar in the quarter. I continue to be pleased with the team's cost focus and ability to quickly dial up or dial down OpEx based on business performance. Our long-term model is to maintain operating expenses at around 25% or less of revenue. Operating income was $109 million in Q1 and better than our internal expectations due to improved demand and strong gross margins.\nOne big highlight for the quarter was our working capital execution. Cash flow from operations was $240 million, a first quarter record for the company, leading to a cash balance of $1.25 billion. Our capital allocation strategy remains consistent, evaluate M&A opportunities, pay an increasing annual dividend and return excess capital to our shareholders through share repurchases. We are making progress on all 3 fronts.\nAs Guy mentioned, we announced the acquisition of Loop deck. They provide valuable technology for Logitech G and while modest an acquisition price reflects our consistent and disciplined approach to M&A. In May, we announced a [ CHF 0.10 ] an increase in our dividend, which will be voted on by our shareholders at our September Annual General Meeting. And just last month, our Board of Directors approved a new $1 billion 3-year share repurchase program. Our existing buyback program expires at the end of July and in total, we will have returned more than $1.1 billion to our shareholders as part of this program. Our new program will replace the expiring program upon its approval by the Swiss Takeover Board.\nMoving on to our outlook. We are raising the first half outlook we confirmed in May expecting first half '24 revenue of $1.875 billion to $1.975 billion. Our corresponding operating income is expected to be between $180 million and $220 million. In our last earnings call, we said we plan to revert to full year estimates either this quarter or next quarter. Today, we are updating the first half and have provided full year estimates based on the progress we made in Q1. There is uncertainty with many factors like FX inflation, the state of the consumer. And then in the December quarter, which is typically our largest quarter and so forth. However, now with 1 quarter behind us, we are providing a full fiscal year '24 outlook. We are expecting revenue of $3.8 billion to $4 billion. Our corresponding operating income is expected to be between $400 million and $500 million.\nI'll close with where I started. Thank you. Thank you to all of our employees for driving such strong execution this quarter and with strong market share and some great new products launching, we are cautiously optimistic. We are going to show a short video on one of our new products, [ Syched ]. Nate roll the video, and then we'll take Q&A.\n[Presentation]"

Welcome to Logitech's video call to discuss our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of fiscal 2023. Joining us today are Bracken Darrell, our President and CEO; and Chuck Boynton, our CFO. As a reminder, during this call, we will make forward-looking statements, including with respect to future operating results under the safe harbor of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\nWe're making these statements based on our views only as of today. Our actual results could differ materially. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any of these statements. We will also discuss non-GAAP financial results. You can find a reconciliation between non-GAAP and GAAP results and information about our use of non-GAAP measures and factors that could impact our financial results and forward-looking statements in our press release and in our filings with the SEC.\nThese materials as well as our prepared remarks and slides and a webcast of this call are all available at the Investor Relations page of our website. We encourage you to review these materials carefully. Unless noted otherwise, comparisons between periods are year-over-year and in constant currency and net sales. This call is being recorded and will be available for a replay on our website. I will now turn the call over to Bracken. Bracken?\n\nBracken P. Darrell\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Logitech International SA\n\nThank you, Nat. Thanks all of you for joining us. Today, I am joining you from New York. This really is a hybrid call. I think Chuck is in -- I know Chuck is in California and Nat, I believe you're in Dallas. So we're really all over. about 60 days ago, we provided an overview of our business and our outlook for the coming fiscal year, and Chuck will cover the details. But big picture, we ended this year with our latest outlook. And the outlook for the first half of fiscal year '24 remains unchanged.\nMost of the macroeconomic and geopolitical issues that impacted our fiscal year '23 results continue. Central banks are raising rates to combat inflation, consumer confidence remains lower, and overall demand from enterprises remains [indiscernible] . As I look at factors that are more directly impacting our business, it's a mixed bag. There are positive signs. The dollars weakening thankfully, shipping rates, lead times and our reliance on expedited shipping are nearing pre-pandemic levels.\nPromotional levels are normalizing, and supply chains appear to be a problem in the past. However, industry layoffs continue, the way companies handle return to the office continues to be uncertain. And we're not yet seeing refresh cycles kick in for products that were in high demand during the pandemic. As we said last quarter, these conflicting economic signals has created an environment with low visibility and a bias towards managing our business conservatively.\nAdjusting our business to meet the market opportunity is something that is not new to us. We adopted throughout the pandemic when we face supply chain, logistics and manufacturing challenges. And we're adapting now to reshape our organization for more nimble decision-making, faster product design cycles, meeting evolving customer needs quickly and fluidly and improving our speed to market.\nSo while acknowledging the macro headrooms, we ended Q4 in a solid position, our sales teams closed a number of meaningful customer deals. We closed one with Snowflake, for example, and representing multiple industries as well as education and government contracts. We released 52 new products in fiscal year '23. And while it takes time to scale these launches that demonstrates a commitment to product innovation, we won a record number of design awards.\nThe latest number is over 160 for the full year, 82 in the fourth quarter alone. Innovation is the key engine of this business and it's firing on all cylinders. Our commitment to sustainability is absolutely unwavering. In fact, we now have nearly 45% of our products with carbon labels. I believe there's no other company of our size or bigger, near this level.\nWe quickly reduced operating expenses to match the revenue reality. Revenue decline in OpEx reductions were down equally on a percentage basis for the year. As I indicated last quarter and at our Analyst and Investor Day, our fiscal year '23 results were disappointing. But as I always say to myself, it's tied to draw a line behind our heels, learn from the past, but move forward, and that's exactly what we're doing. We remain committed to the long-term growth trends, markets, strategy and business model we have in place.\nSo looking ahead, you should expect us to operate the business in a disciplined manner consistent with what we've demonstrated over the last few quarters. We will continue to adjust our expenses in line with the market. We'll continue to invest in product development. We have plans to introduce a whole line of new -- a whole series of new products across gaming, video collaboration and keyboards and mice in the quarters to come. and we will continue to improve and refine our global go-to-market capabilities.\nI'm confident that the big durable trends we've been highlighting, video everywhere, hybrid work and the explosion of gaming and content creation will drive growth. Challenging times always sharpen your focus. And in fiscal year '23 -- and the fiscal year '23 definitely sharpened hours, we quickly resized in a prudent methodical fashion while remaining committed to the keystone of our business, product innovation or as I think of it, design-led engineering.\nWe are confident that we've taken the appropriate steps to spring load our categories for growth as we exit this economic cycle and move ahead. One final point before I turn it over to Chuck. I've said a little this before, but [indiscernible] repeating. I said earlier that 45% of our products now include carbon labeling. This is a huge deal for Logitech but it could be an even bigger deal for the world. I'd like to point out that we're not trying to create competitive advantage here. We'd love the chance to help others, including competitors to advance carbon labeling.\nSo please, for those of you listening, consumers, investors, analysts and our competitors, you can have an impact, a big one. I'd ask that next time you're interacting with any company, including your own, ask them about their approach to carbon labeling. We can move this ahead so much faster for the betterment of our customers and for the world.\nCarbon labels on all our products can be the new calorie, and that will drive competition and bring down carbon levels. With that, I'll hand it over to Chuck to provide some additional color on Q4 and fiscal year '23 results. Chuck? And Chuck, I want you to notice that I wore my jacket. I felt so much pressure from you. You said until we have growth, you have to work a jacket to the earnings calls. And I don't like we're in jacket, so I hope it's not long.\n\nCharles D. Boynton\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, SunPower Corp.\n\nWell, you look great, Bracken. Well, thank you, and I appreciate you all joining our call today. Our silicon mall site is being relocated. So I'm calling in from my house today using a 4K Brio webcam, the Logidock and our MX Series mouse and keyboard. Next quarter, we should be office in San Jose.\nNow let me delve into the fourth quarter and full year in greater detail. Our Q4 and full year results were in line with the revised outlook we shared during our Analyst Day in March. For the quarter, net sales in constant currency declined by 20% to $960 million. For the full year, net sales were down 13% to $4.5 billion. Examining our category performance, results were in line with expectations with continued pressure in video collaboration down 25% and gaming down 22% due to a slowdown in simulation, while our creativity and productivity categories either held steady or improved sequentially.\nIn Q4, gross margins were in line with our expectations, decreasing year-over-year to 36.3%. For the year, gross margins were 38.3%, down 340 basis points compared to fiscal year '22. Margins were pressured throughout the year due to unfavorable currency movements, inflation-driven cost increases and product mix. As we transition to fiscal year '24, we anticipate the weakening U.S. dollar euro exchange rate and lower manufacturing costs to contribute to improved gross margins. We judiciously reduced operating expenses over the year while continuing to invest in our product innovation, initiatives and enterprise selling capabilities.\nOperating income was $82 million in Q4 and $589 million for the full year. Operating income in both the quarter and the year reflected lower demand and gross margin pressure, partially offset by reductions in operating expenses. Cash flow from operations was $216 million in Q4 and $534 million for the full year. Our ending cash balance was over $1.1 billion. Notably, we returned a total of $577 million to shareholders in fiscal year '23 through our share repurchase program and dividend payment.\nIn March, we outlined our intentions to quickly address 2 opportunities: one, improve our cash conversion cycle by reducing on-hand inventory and optimizing channel inventory; and two, reduced operating expenses to a run rate of $1 billion. Although less than 2 months have passed since we presented these plans, I'm encouraged by the strong momentum on both fronts. I'm pleased to report that our on-hand inventory was down for the fourth consecutive quarter with Q4 seeing the biggest reduction of the year.\nOur goal over the next year or so is to continuously improve inventory turns to 5 or better. Furthermore, we plan to keep reducing channel inventory in the first half of the year before the normal build to the December quarter. As we mentioned during Analyst Day, we believe lower channel and on-net inventory provide better economics for us and our partners in the value chain. We are maintaining the outlook we provided in March, expecting H1 fiscal year '24 revenue of $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion, down approximately 22% to 18% compared to the prior year in U.S. dollars.\nOur corresponding operating income is expected to be between $160 million and $190 million, down approximately 47% to 37%. Nate, we can now open the line for questions."

Good morning, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Logitech's video call to discuss our financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Joining us today are Bracken Darrell, our President and CEO; and Nate Olmstead, our CFO.\nAs a reminder, during this call, we will make forward-looking statements, including with respect to future operating results under the safe harbor of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

We encourage you to review these materials carefully.\nAnd unless otherwise noted, comparisons between periods are year-over-year and in constant currency. And sales are net sales. And finally, this call is being recorded and will be available for replay on our website.\nAnd with that, I will now turn the call over to Bracken. Good morning, Bracken.\n\nBracken P. Darrell\n\nPresident, CEO & Executive Director, Logitech International S.A.\n\nGood morning, Nate. And thanks, Nate, and thanks to all of you for joining us. As you saw in our preannouncement, our third quarter results were disappointing. Enterprise demand deteriorated versus last quarter, and consumer purchases were soft and more concentrated during promotional weeks than is typical. Those factors pressured our net sales and gross margins and resulted in a revised fiscal year '23 outlook.\nI've discussed for the past few quarters the ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical challenges impacting Logitech and the world. A strong dollar, global inflation and low consumer confidence continue. In the midst of these, we focused on what we can control: product innovation, a strong go-to-market strategy and disciplined P&L management.\nSo what changed during Q3 that pressured our results? First, our enterprise demand declined. Our VC business had delivered consecutive quarters of 7% growth and fell 16% this quarter.\nYou all have read the headlines. Google, Amazon, Microsoft, banks and other businesses have announced layoffs and cost containment actions. Initially resilient in the face of pressured macro conditions, businesses are increasingly cautious in their spending, given the economic volatility and uncertainty. And of course, that is impacting our enterprise business, too.\nThe second change in this quarter was a shift in our consumer's purchasing patterns. Consumer sales remained weak. And importantly, of those consumers that did buy, these purchases were concentrated and timed with higher promotional intensity, resulting in lower sales and pressured margins.\nWhile current macroeconomic conditions and even the variables that changed in the third quarter aren't going away this quarter, they don't impact our view of the long-term potential of this business. We remain committed to the long-term growth trends, strong market strategy, the markets and the business models we have in place over time.\nI fully expect us to return to more predictable, less volatile economic conditions. And I believe this will support business investment, rising consumer confidence, sustained growth at Logitech. Because if we look beyond the whipsaw of the daily headlines, I'm actually struck by what hasn't changed. While the pace of return to offices remains uneven, hybrid work is inevitable. Companies' approach to return to the office has been different across industries and geographies.\nI hear a familiar story from CEOs and customers across industries. They're still working to determine what hybrid model works best for their teams. Logitech is no different. We're relocating and redesigning buildings in the Bay Area and across the globe focused on a hybrid work environment.\nAs companies settle out on their definitions of hybrid work, we should see investment in personal workspaces and collaboration rooms. This investment will happen. It's just a question of timing.\nProduct innovation matters more than ever. The winners will have great products. That's why we keep investing. We're also diversifying the ASPs in our portfolio through innovation across our categories.\nOur oldest business, pointing devices, had ASPs 25% higher this quarter than 4 years ago as we've systematically expanded the category into new segments with differentiated features. This is obviously by design. Making sure we have category-defining products across a broad range of ASPs is our goal.\nInnovation requires investment, and our R&D investment this quarter was up 50% more than we invested in Q3 2020. Few companies have the financial resources and the management discipline to sustain investment in product development during challenging times while driving efficiency at the same time. We continue to press that advantage and are enhancing our product portfolio.\nThe big durable trends we've been highlighting, video everywhere, hybrid work, the explosion of gaming and content creation, continue to move ahead. People today want to work, play and create from anywhere. And we believe that our products will be a great enabler of this trend.\nLet me provide a little more perspective on this quarter's performance. I mentioned consumer spending was weak in the quarter, and it was, with sell-through, excluding currency, and our prior business in Russia and Ukraine only declined mid-single digits. We grew market share in gaming, video collaboration, pointing devices and tablet keyboards.\nIn video collaboration, while the number of conference cam units declined year-over-year, we continue to drive ASPs per room higher. The mix of our conference room sales is skewing to higher-end cameras. And the attach rate of accessories and services to our conference room cam sales is growing, which drives our sales revenue per room higher, evidence that our strategy, developing integrated room systems is working.\nIn keyboards and mice, we continue to gain share in the fast-growing high end of the market. So what can you expect from us in the near term? You should expect us to operate in a conservative, disciplined manner, consistent with the last few quarters.\nNamely, we'll focus on decreasing our expenses. We plan to reduce operating expenses by $150 million or 11% by the end of fiscal year '23. We're on track to well exceed that goal.\nFor Q3, OpEx was down 23%. You've watched us be aggressive on our OpEx as we saw the market weaken, and you can expect us to continue to manage our costs based on market conditions. We'll continue to invest in product development, though. Customer needs are evolving quickly. We have the engineering and design expertise, customer insights and financial flexibility to bring new products to market to meet this demand and to accelerate refresh cycles. And we will lean into our global operations and go-to-market capabilities.\nOne final note before I hand it over to Nate. First, regarding our CFO search, our search is progressing well, though we don't have an update to share with you today.\nSecond, I'm really pleased to announce that our current Head of Global Operations and Sustainability, Prakash Arunkundrum, has been appointed Chief Operating Officer here at Logitech. Prakash has been here for close to 7 years and is a frequent presenter at our annual Analyst and Investor Day. So many of you already know him. In this newly created role, Prakash will be one of my key partners in making sure we are structured strategically and operationally for the short- and long-term road ahead.\nWith that, I will hand it to Nate to provide some additional color on our results. Thanks, Nate.\n\nNathan Olmstead\n\nCFO, Logitech International S.A.\n\nThanks, Bracken. Hello, everyone. Let me walk you through the quarter in more detail. Our Q3 results were impacted by a challenging macro environment. Net sales were down 17% to $1.27 billion. This reflects consumer purchasing concentrated in promotional weeks throughout the quarter and lower enterprise and consumer spending.\nGross margins decreased versus last year to 37.9%. Versus the prior year, currency was unfavorable 3 points. Promotions were also unfavorable 3 points, and cost inflation was unfavorable 2 points. These 8 points of headwinds were partially offset through our pricing actions and by driving down our use of expedited shipping.\nOperating profit was $204 million, reflecting lower demand and gross margin pressure, partially offset by reductions in operating expense. Cash flow from operations was $280 million in Q3, and cash flow is up $118 million year-to-date versus last year.\nTurning to results across our product categories. Gaming was down 10%. Growth in our simulation products was essentially flat and more than offset by declines in PC and console gaming. Asia Pacific was down only modestly, while Americas and Europe remain pressured.\nDespite these declines, we gained market share in nearly all gaming categories. The largest negative swing in our portfolio versus last quarter was in video collaboration, which was down 16% after posting consecutive quarters of 7% growth. Video conference room cameras and peripherals declined single digits, but we gained share. And business-oriented webcams were down more than 40%.\nPointing devices were down 8% driven by pressure in the low end of our portfolio, but we grew market share in total pointing devices. Keyboards and combos net sales declined 17% with gains in the high end of the market, offset by losses in the low end of the market, and consumer webcams were down nearly 50% year-over-year.\nTurning to expenses. Consistent with last quarter, we reduced our OpEx, which was down 23% versus last year. As Bracken mentioned earlier, we remain committed to investing in product design and development to strengthen our category leadership. And while R&D was down modestly versus last year, the $63 million we invested in R&D in Q3 is more than 50% higher than our R&D investment level just 3 years ago.\nIn Q1 of this fiscal year, we communicated our plan to reduce our annual operating expenses by $150 million versus last year, and we achieved that goal this quarter, 1 quarter ahead of schedule. I now expect that for the full year, we will reduce operating expenses by approximately $215 million or 15% versus last year. We will continue to focus on finding efficiencies throughout the organization as we manage our costs based on market conditions.\nWe ended the quarter with a cash balance of more than $1 billion and continued a strong share buyback program, returning $90 million to shareholders in the quarter. We revised our financial outlook for FY '23 based on 3 items: softer-than-expected third quarter results; enterprise and consumer demand, which may remain weaker than we previously expected; and uncertainty in supply availability related to the recent COVID outbreaks in China.\nOur outlook calls for full year revenue in FY '23 to be down 13% to 15% in constant currency. The U.S. dollar weakened versus last quarter, but currency still projects to be a roughly 5-point headwind to U.S. dollar growth for the full year. Therefore, our outlook for full year revenue in U.S. dollars would be down 18% to 20%. Our full year non-GAAP operating income outlook is now between $550 million and $600 million.\nNate, we can now open the line for questions."

Good morning and good afternoon. Thank you, everyone, for joining us. Welcome to Logitech's video call to discuss our financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2023. A call to discuss our financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Joining us today are Bracken Darrell, our President and CEO; and Nate Olmstead, our CFO.\nDuring this call, we will make forward-looking statements, including with respect to future operating results under the safe harbor Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We're making these statements based on our views only as of today, and our actual results could differ materially.\nWe undertake no obligation to update or revise any of these statements, and we will also discuss non-GAAP financial results. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP and GAAP results and information about our use of non-GAAP measures and factors that could impact our financial results in our press release and in our filings with the SEC, including our most annual -- most recent annual report and subsequent filings.\nThese materials as well as our prepared remarks and slides and a webcast of this call are all available at the Investor Relations page of our website. We encourage you to review these materials carefully. Unless noted otherwise, comparisons between periods are year-over-year and in constant currency and sales are net sales. This call is being recorded and will be available for a replay on our website.\nWith that, I will now turn the call over to Bracken. Bracken?\n\nBracken P. Darrell\n\nPresident, CEO & Executive Director, Logitech International S.A.\n\nThank you, Nate, and thanks to all of you, as usual, for joining us. Last quarter, we discussed the ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical challenges impacting Logitech and the world. And the short story is that the industry is volatile. Inflation continues to be an issue, the dollar remains strong, the war continues, and consumer confidence appears to be tepid.\nDespite this volatility, we're committed to a straightforward approach as we manage the business. We'll continue to invest in product innovation, volume manage the near term conservatively.\nFirst, let's talk about innovation. We love the categories we're in. We're optimistic about their growth trends on the markets, the strategy and our business model. We just had one of the most impressive sets of product launches in the history of Logitech.\nAll told, we announced more than 20 new products in the quarter, 20. In my time at Logitech, I don't think we've ever launched this many. More important than the sheer number, though, is that I believe this year, they have never been more innovative.\nWe've increased our product development investments over the past 3 years, and you're seeing the results of those investments as we further separate ourselves from others in the market.\nAnd with everything going on in the world, our teams are doubling down. It's so exciting. Many of these new products, by the way, are additive to our existing portfolio. We're increasing our addressable markets.\nAnd equally as important, they're designed to take advantage of the big durable trends we've been highlighting, video everywhere, hybrid work and the explosion of gaming and content creation. We continue to develop products to help businesses and employees thrive in this new and evolving work-from-anywhere world.\nAnd as the environment changes, we're continuing to learn something new every day, every week about what the future holds. And it's that evolution that creates the demand for innovation, and that's the kind of markets we like to be in, markets where our expertise in design and user insights is rewarded by customers.\nFor example, for B2B customers, we announced Logitech Sight, addressing the question we hear most from enterprises about videoconferencing. What do I really need in a conference room to make hybrid work, work? We're passionate about creating an equitable experience for remote participants and in-room participants.\nSight is the next step bridging this gap. It's a tabletop camera that will be sold as part of our conference room solutions, and it uses AI to more intelligently track conversations and provide a more natural video perspective to enhance meeting effectiveness.\nI'm especially excited about this product because it highlights two important areas where we continue to make strides. It's powered by AI software, an excellent example of our increasingly software-driven solutions.\nAnd it's a perfect example of a product that's completely additive to our existing portfolio of conferencing products, seamlessly working with Rally Bar in [Scribe], just to name a couple of them. Nobody else has a solution like this. It's such an important product. I think of it as the missing piece of the conference room setup.\nFor the personal workspace, we launched a new set of keyboards and mice design, especially for Mac users, which will expand our addressable market and the work-from-anywhere trend.\nAnd now let's look at Gaming, where the team had a really strong quarter of product launches. Similar to the trend in video and hybrid work, we're seeing more gamers demanding products to let them game from anywhere. We announced G CLOUD, a gaming device designed for cloud gamers that accesses PC and console games from nearly anywhere. And as of Sight for B2B customers, this product is completely additive to our Gaming lineup.\nGamers want on-demand access to their favorite games and high-quality gaming experiences wherever they happen to be. And that's exactly what G CLOUD provides. Later in the quarter, we released our lineup of PRO Racing Wheels and Pedals, which I believe are far and away the best in the industry.\nThese are the high-end, high-performing products, and the response has been incredibly positive. List goes on and on.\nGaming launched its Aurora suite of products, a new set of keyboards, mice, microphones and headsets targeting a larger customer set, with expanded color and design choices, and new features like headsets more easily worn with earrings and a broader range of hair styles. For creators, we have a new studio-quality microphone and lighting.\nWe're pushing ahead on the metaverse and in partnership with Meta, released an immersive audio solution, Logitech Chorus. You get the point. So what's the common thread that runs through these product launches?\nThey offer a high-quality, seamless experience for people to work, play and create, wherever and whenever they want. They're tightly integrated with our existing product portfolio and in some cases, expand the addressable market.\nBy investing in our product roadmap, while also focusing on operational efficiency, we'll ultimately come out of this downturn better positioned and poised for strong growth.\nMany companies talk about investing through times of economic uncertainty. We're doing it. But make no mistake, we're not operating in normal times, and we're acutely aware of the macro challenges. We're focused on what we can control.\nLast quarter, we discussed a plan under this theme. What you saw this quarter were the first steps in executing that plan, we decreased our expenses, focused on operational efficiency. We committed to reducing operating expenses by $150 million or 11% by the end of the fiscal year. We're on track to meet that goal.\nFor Q2, OpEx was down 15%. And part of the operational efficiency is realigning our org structure. Earlier this year, we merged our commercial organizations into one team. The goal was to serve B2B customers in a coordinated way, leveraging one Logitech to sell a portfolio of Logitech's relevant products.\nThis quarter, we evolved our business group and engineering structures to directly align with our new commercial structure and customer audiences, B2B customers, end users and gamers plus streamers. Along with operational efficiencies, this will allow us to better compete within the enterprise market and better serve end users at the same time. We executed targeted pricing increases, and our operations team continues to look for more cost-effective ways of getting our products to market.\nOur gross margin for the quarter was a strong 38.6% given inflation and currency headwinds, and we've, not yet started to see the lower shipping rates flow through our P&L. Looking ahead, you should expect us to continue to operate this way. And we'll be prudent in the near term while investing in our priorities to grow in the long term.\nAnd that's why I'm so optimistic about our future. People will invest in their workspaces. People will participate in video calls. People will game, people will create content. And Logitech will be right in the middle of all of it.\nBefore I turn the call over to Nate for a breakdown of our financial performance, I'd like to say a few things about what you saw in our press release about Nate's next steps. Nate's been my CFO for nearly 4 years. We've worked through the pandemic and have grown this company nearly twice the size when I hired him.\nHe has done an amazing job as CFO in a period that's unlike anything Logitech's ever gone through. Nate and I talk regularly about his personal aspirations and those for the company.\nAnd over the course of these conversations, we came to an understanding that now would be a reasonable time for him to move on to the next opportunity. He's built a best-in-class finance team over the last few years that will support the transition for a new CFO.\nAnd as important, Nate plans to stay on Board until his replacement's in place. I am very grateful to you, Nate, for everything you've done for Logitech, and I can speak for the Board and say they are too. So Nate, with that, can you take us through the quarter's financial performance?\n\nNathan Olmstead\n\nCFO, Logitech International S.A.\n\nThanks, Bracken, and thanks for your kind words. Let me walk you through the quarter in more detail. In Q2, net sales were down 7% to $1.15 billion. While sales were down, this was the third consecutive quarter of improved year-over-year growth performance. We grew in Video Collaboration and Pointing Devices, while Gaming showed nice sequential improvement in year-over-year growth, down 4% after being down 13% in Q1.\nGross margins decreased versus last quarter, as expected, to 38.6%. Versus the prior year, product cost and freight rate increases were unfavorable 3 points, and currency was unfavorable 2 points. We partially offset these headwinds with our pricing actions and by driving down our use of air freight.\nOperating profit was $156 million, reflecting lower demand, inflationary cost pressures and unfavorable currency and our continued investment in our product development capabilities. Cash flow from operations was $73 million in Q2, and cash flow is up $215 million year-to-date versus last year.\nTurning to results across our product categories. Gaming showed some resilience in the quarter, led by growth in Racing Wheels. For Q2, Gaming was down 4%, which is a marked improvement from last quarter. Americas and Europe Gaming sales remained pressured, while Asia continues to grow up 25%.\nAs with last quarter, we outperformed the market and gained PC gaming share. We think our product portfolio is in great shape, with strong new product introductions as we head into the holiday season.\nVideo Collaboration posted a second consecutive quarter of 7% growth. Video conference room cameras and peripherals grew nearly 30%. This growth was offset by a decline in business-oriented webcams, which were down more than 30%, although their sales remained more than 3x higher than pre-pandemic levels.\nWe talked about this dynamic for several quarters, pressure in webcams following the incredible dynamic and pandemic-driven growth, somewhat offsetting solid and strong growth in conference room cameras and peripherals.\nPointing Devices were up 3%, driven by our new Lift Ergonomic mouse and our high-end MX Master 3S. Keyboards and Combos net sales declined 10% due to low end market softness in China and Europe, partially offset by a strong start from our new high-end MX mechanical keyboard. Keyboard sell-through was essentially flat in the quarter. And as with our business webcams, consumer webcams were pressured and down 33% from pandemic highs.\nIn any given quarter, results across our categories may not move up or down in concert. It's the benefit of having a diversified portfolio that we like so much. This quarter was no different. So what we focus on is the performance of the categories that are addressing secular trends in Gaming, Video Collaboration and hybrid work.\nSales of our Pointing Devices, Keyboards and Combos, Gaming and VC products were 80% of our total net sales this quarter and were up 1% year-over-year in constant currency and excluding Russia. Their sales grew 1% year-over-year in constant currency and excluding Russia.\nIt's also important to note that the combined gross margins for this set of categories are above the company average. So our biggest categories addressing attractive secular trends grew and produced above average margins.\nTurning to expenses. Consistent with the first quarter, we reduced our expenses, most notably in sales and marketing, which was down 21%. As Bracken mentioned earlier, we remain committed to investing in product design and development to strengthen our category leadership, and we increased R&D spend by 3%.\nLast quarter, we committed to reduce our annual operating expenses by $150 million versus last year, and we are on track to meet that commitment by year end. We will continue to focus on finding efficiencies throughout the organization as we align our spend with our sales.\nWe ended the quarter with a cash balance of $869 million. In September, our shareholders approved our proposed dividend distribution, which when combined with our continued buyback program, returned $276 million to shareholders in the quarter.\nWe are now halfway through the fiscal year. And despite the headwinds, we remain confident in our ability to meet the outlook we announced last quarter. As a reminder, that outlook calls for full-year revenue in FY '23 to be down 4% to 8% in constant currency.\nThe U.S. dollar continued to strengthen versus last quarter, and currency now projects to be a roughly 5-point headwind to U.S. dollar growth. Therefore, our outlook for full-year revenue in U.S. dollars would be down 9% to 13%.\nOur full-year non-GAAP operating income outlook remains between $650 million and $750 million, despite the incremental currency pressures. This pressure is expected to be offset by incremental efficiency gains throughout the organization and favorability in logistics rates.\nMuch like last quarter, our intent is to provide you with a range of reasonable outcomes, given a highly volatile -- given the highly volatile nature of the global economy. We've made assumptions about a number of factors, including potentially protracted economic volatility and sustained revenue and profit pressure from the stronger U.S. dollar.\nAt the high end of our outlook, we assume a relatively normal holiday cycle. While at the low end, we've assumed a holiday lift generally aligned with the worst in the last decade.\nAnd while it continues to be challenging to forecast with a level of precision and certainty in line with pre-pandemic business cycles, we believe maintaining our forecast is prudent and reasonable. [You there,] Nate? It's time to open the call for your questions. Thanks."

Unless otherwise noted, comparisons between periods are year-over-year and in constant currency and sales are net sales.\nAnd finally, this call is being recorded and will be available for a replay on our website.\nAnd with that, I will now turn the call over to Bracken. Good morning, Bracken.\n\nBracken P. Darrell\n\nPresident, CEO & Executive Director, Logitech International S.A.\n\nThank you, Nate, and thanks all of you for joining us. Logitech like many other companies, is experiencing the impact of a wide range of overlapping macroeconomic and geopolitical issues.\nThe war in Ukraine directly reduced our net sales about 2% versus last year, as we talked about earlier. Foreign currency headwinds have increased with the dollar strengthening to nearly 1:1 in the year amount. Inflation rose further and consumer confidence has weakened.\nNone of these fundamentally affect our optimism for our target markets, our strategy or our business model. But as we looked at the quarter and head into the rest of the year, we believe it's prudent to take a more conservative view than we had previously. Impacted by these challenges, our net sales were down 9% in constant currency this quarter. There were clear highlights for sure, solid growth in video collaboration, keyboards and combos and porting devices as hybrid and return to work trends continued to take shape.\nWe grew market share, and we delivered solid gross margins at 40% despite worsening inflation and currency impacts. As I just said, our overall net sales in Q1, combined with the worsening macroeconomic picture may just take a hard look at our assumptions for the rest of the fiscal year.\nWe can't affect currency exchange rates or inflation records, but we can adjust our business to the current conditions. And although we can't predict the depth and duration of these macroeconomic conditions, we can conservatively manage our business until we have evidence that the markets will return to stronger growth. In short, we can't change the macros, but we can adjust to them. and that's what we're doing.\nBased on current conditions and performance, we're implementing plans to reduce operating expenses by approximately 10% or about $150 million versus last year, predominantly through variable cost reductions. As our sales nearly doubled since fiscal year '20, we added disproportionately variable cost, which makes us ready to meet the moment. We'll continue to raise prices to offset the currency and inflation and target to keep a strong margin profile. We'll continue to invest in exciting new innovative products. This investment has been a key driver of our sustained share gains, and we believe it will be into the future. All that's leading us to provide you with an updated outlook for fiscal year '23, reducing expectations for both revenue and operating profit.\nWe believe this update appropriately takes into account the macroeconomic and geopolitical environment we're in as well as our own plans to lower our costs and take control of all the variables within our grasp. Before I let Nate take you through our financials and outlook in more detail, let me just say that the macro picture we're dealing with now is challenging, but we believe it's temporary. I'm as optimistic as ever about the long -- the medium and long term. I can't think of anywhere I'd rather be for the long term than writing the secular trends Logitech gets.\nHybrid work or the idea of work from anywhere is simply the future. As I said in a few months ago, the debate is over. Hybrid one. And that will favor Logitech as offices are renewed for new footprints and more video and homes continue to upgrade for better offices. While the gaming market was soft over the past 2 quarters, we believe the interest in gaming will increase over the long term as gaming content expands, cloud gaming grows and more and more people become gamers, socially or even competitively.\nAnd the streaming and content creation trend will grow and grow. From individual creators producing content from home to businesses, leveraging podcasts and creators work to new markets. The use of streaming content continues to expand, driving growth of this trend. So we're going to continue to focus on great long-term growth, but run the business conservatively short term. What does that mean? Our product teams across our largest businesses, video collaboration, C&P and gaming will continue to launch a series of new products throughout the remainder of the year.\nAs in the past, you can expect these products to be packed with the innovative features with innovative features, full of lifestyle design enhancements and critical to the work at play of both consumers and enterprises. Our operations team will continue to optimize our supply chain for the short and long term as we source components from a diversified set of vendors, now much more diversified. Adjust tipping routes and mitigate transportation costs and risks, and finally, diversified manufacturing outside of China.\nWe'll be working hard to flip the inflationary trend to cost reduction, as the macroeconomic type turns and it always turns. Our sales teams, especially our enterprise teams will continue to refine and improve their go-to-market capabilities across the globe. And we'll go out -- we'll go all out to help companies reconfigure offices, expand the video enablement and create workspaces appropriate to this hybrid world.\nWe'll bring down expenses significantly to align with the market realities that we project for this fiscal year. And as we do this, we'll focus on organizing for maximum effectiveness over the next few years. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged: investment in our product design and development capabilities, accretive M&A and returns of capital to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends.\nAnd finally, you can expect our commitment to sustainability to remain firmly in place. We were just named by EcoVadis as one of the top 1% of sustainability companies in the world. And our plan is to turn sustainability into a driver for good and for growth will continue.\nNow let me turn the call over to Nate for a breakdown of our financial performance this quarter and our new outlook. Nate?\n\nNathan Olmstead\n\nCFO, Logitech International S.A.\n\nThanks, Bracken. Bracken described our perspective on the quarter and environment. It signals that we need to be prudent about the rest of the year or until economic trends become more consistent and favorable. I'll spend a few minutes on the quarter and then walk you through our updated outlook.\nIn Q1, net sales were down 9% to $1.16 billion after growing 58% in Q1 of last year. We grew in video collaboration, keyboards and combos and pointing devices while facing tough compares in the macro environment. Gross margins remained essentially flat sequentially despite the litany of external factors that pressured profitability. I mentioned last quarter that cost increases, unfavorable currency rates and higher shipping rates may pressure half 1 fiscal '23 margins. And while we did see these impacts, we managed pricing and reduced our reliance on air freight to help offset these pressures. However, we anticipate Q2 margins will be lower than Q1 as these headwinds remain.\nOperating profit was down as expected after doubling last year. Cash from operations was negative $36 million, also as expected, and an improvement of $79 million versus Q1 last year.\nLet's review some of the results across our product categories. Similar to last quarter, the gaming market continued to decline in Americas and Europe, while growing in Asia, and our results reflected these trends with sales down 13% globally. We outperformed the market, however, and gained PC gaming share. We saw momentum from our products geared toward both social and professional gamers offset by ongoing headset demand weakness in core PC and console gaming.\nVideo Collaboration sales increased 7% as conference room cameras and systems grew double digits to more than offset double-digit declines in business-oriented webcams, which are part of our video collaboration category. In creativity and productivity, keyboards and combos grew 7% and pointing devices were up 3%.\nWe saw solid and consistent demand during the quarter for PC Peripherals and introduced a series of new products. Our master series line added 2 mechanical keyboards and an upgraded mouse, and we also released a line of keyboard combos to support our enterprise customers. Taken together, these results highlight the performance of our categories, addressing the secular trends in gaming, video collaboration and hybrid work.\nSales of our creativity and productivity, gaming and VC products exceeded 80% of our total net sales this quarter and were flat year-over-year in constant currency. If you exclude Russia, these categories actually grew 2%. We have growth opportunities in other categories as well, but I wanted to highlight the performance of these key areas that directly address the strategic secular trends that Bracken referenced. Looking regionally, Asia Pacific grew nicely in the quarter, driven by gaming, while Americas and EMEA sales declined. Through the excellent work of our operations and sales teams, we were largely able to recover from the COVID lockdowns in China.\nFor those that track the sell-in and sell-through data in our earnings slides, you can see that globally, these metrics are in balance. The timing of the Shanghai reopening, however, resulted in the bulk of our China sales occurring later in the quarter which is why Asia sell-in was stronger than sell-through.\nTurning to expenses. I mentioned last quarter that we wouldn't hesitate to reduce our variable expenses, including marketing of conditions warranted given the weaker top line results, that is what we did in Q1. We reduced marketing and sales spend by 10% and reduced G&A by 9%. We've also said that investment in product design and development would remain a priority for Logitech, even during trying economic times and you'll note that we increased R&D investment by 9%. We are not done reducing or eliminating unproductive expenses from our business, and we are driving efficiency in all our spend, including fixed cost, product and freight costs and our go-to-market investments in the channel.\nWe can't offset every headwind that we predict for this year, but we are taking aggressive actions to align our spend with our sales, while sustaining investment, we believe, supports our longer-term growth ambitions. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of approximately $1.1 billion after returning nearly $121 million in capital to shareholders through our share repurchase program. As a sign of our confidence in cash generation, and our commitment to returning cash to shareholders, our Board approved an increase in our repurchase authorization by another $500 million, and we proposed a 10% increase to our dividend per share for approval at our September annual meeting.\nFinally, I'll spend a minute on our updated fiscal year '23 outlook. In May, we provided an annual outlook of 2% to 4% growth in constant currency and an operating profit outlook of $875 million to $925 million. Since that time, we've seen continued and in some cases, intensified deterioration of economic conditions across the globe. Bracken discuss the external environment earlier.\nSo when we developed this new outlook, we made assumptions about a number of factors, including potentially protracted economic volatility and sustained revenue and profit pressure from the stronger U.S. dollar. Given these considerations and the actions we are taking to reduce costs versus last year, we now expect full year revenue to be down 4% to 8% in constant currency and full year non-GAAP operating income to be between $650 million and $750 million.\nAt the midpoint, our outlook for profit is down $200 million versus our prior estimates. At a high level, that comes through 2 headwinds and 2 partial offsets. The headwinds total about $400 million, including approximately $250 million of reduced profit from lower volumes and cost increases and $150 million of lower profit from currency changes. Offsetting these unfavorable impacts are OpEx reductions and pricing.\nSo in summary, we see about $400 million of incremental profit headwinds for the full year, of which we have plans to offset 50% through actions we are taking.\nNate, we can open the line for questions. Thank you."

Good morning, good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Logitech's video call to discuss our financial results for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year of 2022. Joining us today on the call are Bracken Darrell, our President and CEO; and Nate Olmstead, our CFO. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, including with respect to future operating results under the Safe Harbor of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\nWe're making these statements based on our views only as of today. Actual results could differ materially, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any of these statements. We will also discuss non-GAAP financial results, and you can find a reconciliation between these non-GAAP and GAAP results and information about our use of non-GAAP measures and factors that could impact our financial results in our press release and in our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual and quarterly reports and subsequent filings.\nThese materials as well as our prepared remarks and slides and a webcast of this call are all available at the Investor Relations page of our website. We do encourage you to review these materials carefully. And unless otherwise noted, comparisons between periods are year-over-year and in constant currency. Sales are net sales. And finally, this call is being recorded and will be available for a replay on our website. With that, I will now turn the call over to Bracken. Good morning, Bracken.\n\nBracken P. Darrell\n\nPresident, CEO & Executive Director, Logitech International S.A.\n\nGood morning, Nate, and good morning, Nate and Nate. And thanks to all of you for joining us. I am so excited about the year that Logitech has had and our team's strong performance despite a backdrop perhaps best defined as unpredictable and certainly challenging. In spite of this headwinds, our teams delivered an outstanding fourth quarter and overall, a tremendous fiscal year 2022. Coming off a 74% net sales growth in the previous year, we challenged ourselves to continue the momentum, and we did it.\nWe posted our ninth consecutive year of growth, delivered strong growth in key categories like C&P and gaming, saw market share gains across our portfolio and geographies and continued to invest in the future, using our strong gross profits to invest in key strategic areas like marketing and product development.\nNate now will go deeper into the financial details for the fourth quarter and for the fiscal year in just a minute. But I wanted to start by offering a bit of perspective on the macroeconomic environment, world events and overall state of the global business as we head into our new fiscal year. As I talk to other CEOs, we generally agree that there is uncertainty about how the U.S. and global economies will perform, but we'll leave the predictions about that out of this call.\nBut what is the backdrop to our thinking? I see a certain set of conditions that most of you will be familiar with, inflation, war in the Ukraine, COVID lockdowns, changes to monetary policy, supply chain disruptions. These challenges are not just possibilities, of course. They are happening.\nNo business leadership team operating globally could dismiss them. We at Logitech talk about possible impact regularly. And the truth is that all businesses, including ours, operate in this environment with the understanding that we can't influence the outcome at each of these challenges, but we all can adapt, change and ultimately adjust.\nThat's exactly what we've done at Logitech through the last decade. The dynamic nature of Logitech, and we've got more dynamic as we've grown, makes me proud that we've continually found ways to solve old and new challenges, while ultimately serving and delighting customers. We've adjusted, adapted so many times over the past decade. So what does next year look like?\nWell, this may not be the most satisfying answer. The hard truth is that we just don't know exactly how and when this particular set of challenges is going to play out. But I do know we have years of experience operating in challenging environments. We changed the way we source components. We've diversified our shipping strategy.\nWe've automated our factories. We've built a very diverse portfolio. We've changed the way we price our products. We've strengthened our balance sheet, intentionally pursuing a strategy, avoiding high levels of debt. The list goes on, all to ensure we can operate with excellence, discipline and a focus on the future during unpredictable times.\nSo I prefer to look beyond the near term and make sure we're operating in growing categories, staking out long-term leadership positions in those categories and investing in product design and engineering, the absolute lifeblood of our business. And as we discussed in our Analyst Day in March, we are doing exactly that.\nBut what's been true over the last few years is still true today. hybrid work or the idea that we used to call work from anywhere, continues to thrive. There are sales and upgrade opportunities that exist right now across more than 1 billion workspaces, all driven by hybrid working and learning. What an incredible opportunity.\nEverything is moving to video, including this call. Hybrid work is here to stay and most meaningful, be a mix of on-site and virtual, and video helps bring more meeting equity to all participants. Gaming will continue to expand. The long-term momentum is unstoppable. Like most long-term high-growth markets, there will be strong growth quarters and lower ones, but that shouldn't confuse anyone.\nGaming is a juggernaut, and it's evolving and adding new engines of growth. Take the metaverse, for example. The tools needed to experience and create the metaverse are expanding and evolving. A big picture, ask yourselves. What about the fundamental premise of gaming as a cultural phenomenon has changed? The answer? Nothing.\nAnd the streaming and content creation trend hasn't changed but continues to grow rapidly. In other words, while we're very clear eyed and measured in our approach to the near-term challenges and events, we're equally invested in and excited about the durable longer-term trends driving our largest categories.\nOur company's solid performance reflects the broad strength of our capabilities, including the product development that continues to introduce new products on a global scale and also reflects our diverse portfolio and its leading position in growing markets. Our focus on operational execution and the ability to adapt quickly continues to help us navigate industry-wide supply chain challenges and disruptions.\nAnd that's why I'm so incredibly excited about the future at Logitech. With that, let me briefly step into our categories: Creativity and productivity. In creativity and productivity, we had a really strong year, and finished the fiscal year 2022 with good momentum. Mice and keyboards continue to drive this category with another year of creative product development driving growth.\nThere is no debate over the sustainability of hybrid work. Hybrid is here for now and in the future, and C&P is set up to enhance workspaces around the globe. You've heard me say this before, but it remains true. Very few people have the optimal workspace set up either at home or at work. Even I continue to experiment all the time to try to find a better way. I'm excited about what you'll see in the coming quarters from this group.\nGaming grew double digits in fiscal year 2022, on top of an exceptional revenue growth last year. Gaming continues to be adopted by an increasing number of people, as both a competitive esport and as a more casual way to hang out with friends. And we're in the very early inning of what the metaverse can do to enhance the enjoyment and experience of gamers. Gaming is a market that demands innovation, and we're doing just that with more wireless peripherals and higher-performing keyboards and mice. I'm so confident about the long-term potential of this category.\nIn video collaboration, we continue to see pockets of increased activity, with more certainty in office reopenings and hybrid work planning, but planning and purchase timing differ by region. And so as I said earlier, there will be near-term unpredictability and an overall choppy environment but long-term growth.\nWebcams declined versus our lofty mid-pandemic peak, but the need for webcams is strong and the demand is steady, and more than 3x what it was 2 years ago. And our long-term strategy of enabling meeting space with high-quality video systems and solutions, supported by an enhanced sales and support team around the globe, remains well on track.\nConsistent with our mission to develop video collaboration tools that can make remote participants feel they can participate equally or even better than those guided in person in the room, we launched RightSight 2, an AI-based software solution that helps bridge the gap between in-meeting participants and those joining remotely. It's such a smart solution, and we have much more in the works.\nAnd supporting all our products is our Defy Logic marketing campaign. We're increasingly raising awareness of the brand and bringing Logitech's amazing products to the top of every consumer's consideration list. More to come in this area, but we really like the results we're seeing.\nFinally, it's such a fundamental part of our purpose that we focus on environmental sustainability at the core of our business. We were just recognized by The Financial Times as the European climate leader based on our carbon intensity improvement score. It's nice to be recognized like this, but the truth is that this score only covers things that happen in our offices and factories.\nHardware companies like us release much more carbon beyond our 4 walls than in them, as we buy components and products, transport them and consumers like us use them. The rest of our story so far is that we are carbon neutral in scopes 1, 2 and 3, which includes all of those carbon impacts. And we're committed to being carbon negative or climate positive as it's called, beyond 2030.\nOn top of that, earlier this quarter, we announced that we had exceeded our initial commitment to incorporate post-consumer recycled plastic into our products, reducing our carbon impact and increasing the circularity of consumer product materials ingredients. During the last calendar year, 1 of every 3 Logitech product shift used recycled materials, and that's going up into the right.\nWe believe this is the right thing to do for the planet. But we also believe that a growing share of businesses and consumers will favor our products as a result of this industry-leading approach. Now let me turn the call over to Nate for further comments on our financial performance this quarter. Nate?\n\nNathan Olmstead\n\nCFO, Logitech International S.A.\n\nThanks, Bracken. We delivered solid financial results in Q4 and for fiscal year '22 in an environment that was often quite challenging. I'll spend a few minutes on the quarter and then provide some context and texture to our full year results. Q4 was our toughest compare for the year as we grew 108% 1 year ago. In Q4 this year, net sales were down 17% to about $1.2 billion, although impressively, we saw continued growth in pointing devices, keyboards and combos and gaming.\nGross margins were essentially flat sequentially despite ongoing cost pressures and incremental currency headwinds. We remain disciplined with promotions while still gaining share in many categories, and we work to reduce our reliance on air freight.\nLooking ahead to the first half of fiscal year '23, margins could come down further due to ongoing cost increases, unfavorable currency rates and higher levels of air freight as we expedite to recover from supply disruptions due to the China COVID lockdowns. Profit was down for the quarter as was cash flow from operations, both as expected.\nFor fiscal year '22, we turned in our ninth consecutive year of growth, with net sales in constant currency up 4%. As mentioned earlier, C&P and gaming performed particularly well over the course of the year. Overall, gross margin was 41.7%, within our long-term guidance of 39% to 44%. In fiscal year '21, we experienced an unusually low level of promotional and in-store marketing investment, and as expected and planned for, an increase -- and we expected and planned for an increase in such spend this year.\nHigher promotional and retail marketing investment and increased logistics and component costs proved out as margin headwinds. For example, the cost of ocean freight is up about 5x versus fiscal year '20. Operating profit was $904 million, well above our annual guidance provided at the beginning of the fiscal year.\nWe delivered this incremental profit while continuing to invest to improve our capabilities with an emphasis on marketing, product design and engineering. And we returned over $0.5 billion to shareholders through our share repurchase and dividends.\nMoving into our categories. In Creativity and Productivity, keyboards and combos grew 8% in Q4 and 22% for the fiscal year. Pointing devices were up 14% for the year as a strong portfolio, excellent marketing execution and continued demand from hybrid work trends drove strong performance in these categories.\nGaming delivered 1% growth in Q4 and 17% for fiscal year '22, delivering double-digit growth off of a record year last year was impressive. While we experienced pressure in our console gaming and PC gaming headset categories, we have an excellent lineup of innovative products, a leadership position in expanding categories like wireless mice and steering wheels, and are beginning to gain traction with the social gaming segment.\nQ4 video collaboration sales declined 35% after growing more than 200% in Q4 last year. For the year, video collaboration was down 4% after growing more than 180% last year. Conference room cameras and systems grew double digits for the year and continue to lead the category performance behind a refreshed and expanded product portfolio.\nSales in our tablet and other accessories category declined 39% in Q4 and 17% for the year. As a reminder, last year, we saw a surge in sales through our education iPad keyboards, driven by Japan's government-sponsored GIGA program, which expired at the end of March 2021.\nExcluding sales through the GIGA program last year, fiscal year '22 sales in this category grew double digits, and we gained more than 3 points of share in retail keyboards driven by strong product launches and in-store marketing execution. Our mobile speaker sales declined 12% in Q4 and 15% for the full year.\nAs noted previously, we continue to reallocate our resources to faster-growing market opportunities. Our audio and wearables sales decreased 35% in Q4 and 15% for the year as expected. Despite these declines, sales were up more than 40% versus 2 years ago, due primarily to expanded market opportunities for retail headsets and Blue Microphones.\nLooking regionally, for fiscal year '22, our sales were sustained or grew in all 3 regions. Much like the diversification of our category portfolios, our geographic diversification helps us manage risk. For example, hedging against regional softness in demand, geopolitical issues or economic disruptions.\nTurning to expenses. In the quarter, we executed our plan to strategically invest to grow our business over the long term, while our Q4 non-GAAP operating expenses decreased by 13% to $342 million, our fiscal year '22 non-GAAP operating expenses were up 27% to $1.4 billion. As we stated before, this is reflective of continued investment in marketing, sales coverage, product development and operational improvements.\nFor example, we increased the level of automation in our factory by more than 50% over the last year, which helps us reduce our costs, improve quality and reduces our exposure to labor disruptions. And finally, Q4 cash flow from operations was positive $100 million, and we ended the year with a cash balance of approximately $1.3 billion.\nOur cash balance ended this fiscal year about $400 million lower than the end of last year as we returned $571 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases this fiscal year. For the year, our conversion cycle, our cash conversion cycle increased to 77 days. This increase was primarily driven by higher inventory days due to industry-wide supply chain disruptions and demand forecast fluctuations for some of our products.\nWe also continue to leverage our balance sheet to strategically purchase hard to find and long lead time components to help ensure supply availability and maintain competitive advantage. Finally, I'll spend a minute on fiscal year '23 guidance. At our Analyst Day in March, we guided fiscal year '23 revenue to be up mid-single digits and non-GAAP operating income of $900 million to $950 million, and noted that full year revenue from Russia and Ukraine was about 2% of our net sales and was included in our outlook.\nAt that time, the Russian invasion of Ukraine was in its first days. As of now, this war is ongoing, with no sign of resolution in the near term, and we do not expect sales in Russia and Ukraine for the full fiscal year. We continue to monitor the Russia-Ukraine situation and broader potentially challenging market conditions.\nGiven this, we now expect full year revenue to grow between 2% and 4%, and full year non-GAAP operating income is expected to be between $875 million and $925 million. With that, I will hand over to Bracken for some closing remarks. Bracken?\n\nBracken P. Darrell\n\nPresident, CEO & Executive Director, Logitech International S.A.\n\nThank you, Nate. In closing, this year we sustained our scale, delivered record sales on top of last year's 74% sales growth. We delivered many accomplishments, a ninth consecutive year of growth, strong growth in key categories and market share gains across the portfolio. We also beat our original profit target by over $100 million.\nDespite strong year-over-year results, our focus is on the long term. We're riding secular growth trends in hybrid work, video collaboration, esports and digital content creation. We'll continue to deliver against those with agility, operational excellence and a diverse innovative portfolio. I'm super excited for the future.\nBefore I open the call to Q&A, I want to thank all of our employees and partners for continuing to deliver terrific results while navigating a really dynamic and challenging market environment. Your hard work continues to pay off, and I'm really proud of both Q4 and the entire fiscal year '22. Thanks to you all. Nate, we can open the line for questions."
