Now I'll turn the call over to Waste Management's President and CEO, Jim Fish.\n\nJames C. Fish\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Waste Management, Inc.\n\nAll right. Thanks, Ed, and thank you all for joining us. 2021 was another very successful year at WM. Our strong operational and financial performance continued throughout 2021, delivering full year results that achieved or exceeded our financial guidance, which we increased from our original expectations twice during the year. We also successfully integrated the Advanced Disposal operations, generating synergies that have already exceeded our initial expectations with further synergies to come.\nDuring 2021, we focused on driving disciplined organic revenue growth, advancing technology investments focused on customer retention and growth and cultivating our people-first culture. Execution on these priorities came together to produce record growth in full year adjusted operating EBITDA and cash from operations. It can't be overstated how impressive it is that we generated more than $5 billion of operating EBITDA in a year like 2021. This robust operating EBITDA translated into all-time high cash from operations of over $4 billion, which allowed us to return a record $2.3 billion to our shareholders.\nContributing to our operating EBITDA was our pricing where we finished 2021 on a very strong note as we made steady progress on covering the cost inflation in our business with excellent core price results across all lines of business. John will provide more details here, but we had record core price in both our landfill and residential businesses, 2 areas we've been particularly focused on over the last couple of years. Strong core price translated into the best collection and disposal yield that we've seen in more than a decade.\nAnother great story about our pricing efforts is that we're still seeing strong volume growth and improvements in churn. 2021 churn of 8.4% is an all-time low. As 2022 kicks off, we're fully focused on recovering inflationary cost increases through our pricing programs and through the aggressive management of our cost structure. Our revenue management team is hard at work executing on the 2022 pricing plans so that we can recover the inflationary cost pressures in our business and deliver another successful year. In fact, we've recently seen several large customers, who have historically been very price-sensitive, renew at significant increases.\nOn the cost front, a big part of that management of our cost structure will be to materially improve our labor efficiency through the application of the technology investments we made over the last 18 months. Our expectation is to attrit between 5,000 and 7,000 positions over the next 4 years without replacements as these positions have become difficult to source and we expect that will continue to be the case. At the same time, we continue to focus on providing the best workplace for our employees and leveraging our asset network for growth.\nRegarding our 2022 financial outlook, Devina will provide more details, but at a high level, we expect to deliver total company revenue growth of approximately 6%, driving operating EBITDA growth of approximately 7% in 2022. It's fair to point out that both our revenue and our operating EBITDA guidance are at or above the high end of the ranges we targeted for the long term at our Investor Day in 2019. We expect margin expansion in the second half of the year with full year operating EBITDA margins expected to be flat to up 40 basis points compared to 2021.\nThis sets us up for another year of robust cash generation. The extraordinary cash generation of our business positions us to plan a 13% increase in our 2022 dividend rate, while at the same time, making substantial increased investments in high-return renewable energy and recycling projects.\nTara Hemmer was appointed as our Chief Sustainability Officer last summer, and she's charting a path to an aggressive long-term growth for our sustainability businesses. In light of our very strong cash generation, we plan to invest approximately $275 million in 2022 to expand our network of renewable natural gas plants, with incremental investments in 2023 through 2025 totaling approximately $550 million. We expect to build 17 RNG plants over the next 4 years, which would grow our RNG generation by 6x. With conservative assumptions, these projects are expected to generate operating -- annual operating EBITDA run rate operating EBITDA of more than $400 million by 2026. And at today's higher prices, that operating EBITDA more than doubles.\nIn the recycling business, we expect to invest $275 million in 2022 in MRF technology with incremental investments in 2023 through 2025 totaling approximately $525 million. These investments accelerate our automation of recycling process, processing to reduce costs, improve product quality as well as expand our single-stream recycling footprint. Together, these projects are expected to generate annual run rate incremental operating EBITDA of approximately $180 million by 2026, assuming $125 per ton blended commodity price.\nThese growth projects further WM's sustainability leadership by increasing the renewable energy generated from our landfill network, expanding single-stream recycling capacity and automating recycling processing to reduce costs and improve product quality. They also are expected to generate excellent returns that are superior to those of solid waste acquisitions.\nIn closing, we delivered a fantastic year in 2021, overcoming the challenges the year presented. As we look ahead to 2022, we remain committed to advancing technology investments that differentiate us, automating our processes to reduce our cost to serve and leveraging our sustainability platform for growth. Our success would not have been possible without the best employees in the business, and I want to thank all 50,000 of our team members for their contributions. I'll now turn the call over to John to discuss in more detail our operational results.\n\nJohn J. Morris\n\nExecutive VP & COO, Waste Management, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Our team finished 2021 strong with fourth quarter organic revenue growth in the collection and disposal business of 6.5%. Our fourth quarter core price of 6.7% in the commercial line of business and 5.2% in our landfills clearly demonstrate continued discipline and pricing momentum. These strong fourth quarter pricing results were the leading contributors to robust collection and disposal core price of 4.8% for the full year.\n2021 yield was also strong at 3.5% and reflects an improvement in rollbacks of almost 500 basis points as well as continued improvement in customer churn. As we move into 2022, our revenue management teams are focused on continuing to recover inflationary cost increases, improving residential profitability and remaining disciplined on disposal pricing. With the strong momentum we have entering 2022, coupled with our team's continued diligence, we expect to deliver core price of more than 5.5% and yield approaching 4%.\nShifting to volumes. Fourth quarter collection and disposal volume grew 2.8%. For the full year, our collection and disposal volumes grew 3% and service increases outpaced service decreases nearly twofold. Organic growth trends in the first few weeks of 2022 have been encouraging even as some parts of the U.S. and Canada have seen spikes in Omicron cases during January. Commercial yards are tracking above 2021 levels. And while industrial hauls are modestly below last year, we see that as mostly due to weather disruptions in a few areas across the country. Overall, we expect 2022 collection and disposal volumes to grow about 2%, with commercial collection and MSW landfill volumes as leading contributors.\nTurning to operating costs. Adjusted operating expenses as a percentage of revenue increased 150 basis points year-over-year to 63% with commodity-driven impacts from recycling brokerage rebates and fuel totaling 100 basis points. The remaining increase was related to higher labor costs as overtime increased due to the highest number of COVID-related absences we have seen as well as some risk management costs. During the fourth quarter, our teams remain focused on controlling operating costs. And while the impacts of inflation and the tight labor market continue to put pressure on our metrics, there are positive trends in the fourth quarter results that position us well to deliver on our 2022 plan.\nMaintenance expenses improved sequentially as our continued efforts to standardize maintenance processes, particularly in our ADS locations, is reducing downtime and improving fleet availability. We also saw efficiency, net of incremental training hours, improving all lines of business. We expect these efficiency gains to continue and overtime hours to improve as our teams are taking intentional steps to improve retention, and we see that making an impact as annualized driver turnover has improved every month since August. We estimate that our focus on operating efficiencies and productivity helped to moderate the impact of inflationary cost pressure by about 60 basis points versus the third quarter.\nSo putting it all together, when you combine our pricing efforts with our progress on cost containment, we expect operating expense as a percentage of revenue to improve by the second half of 2022. Our collection and disposal business is well positioned to deliver great results in 2022 and so are our recycling and renewable energy businesses.\nAs Jim discussed, our sustainability businesses are central to our growth strategy, and we're pleased with the strong results we're achieving in both the recycling and renewable energy businesses. In recycling, each quarter of 2021 earned a spot among our 5 most profitable quarters of all time, and we're anticipating an equally strong year in 2022. Our current outlook for 2022 is based on an average blended commodity price of $125 per ton, which is modestly above current values of $115 per ton.\nAnd similarly, renewable energy business delivered a very strong 2021 results and is expected to match this earnings contribution in 2022 as 2 additional renewable natural gas plants come online. We expect our fifth plant to be operational early in the second quarter and the sixth plant to be online by the end of the year. Our 2022 outlook is based on a RINs price of about $3, which is slightly above our 2021 rate but below current RINs pricing.\nAnd finally, our integration of Advanced Disposal continues to go smoothly as we marked the first anniversary of the acquisition at the end of October. To date, we have combined virtually all the acquired operations into our billing and operational systems. And with $36 million of synergies captured during the fourth quarter, we exited 2021 on track to exceed our expectations for full run rate cost and capital synergies of $150 million.\nIn closing, I want to thank the entire WM team for their focus on safely and reliably servicing our customers. The team has done an exceptional job managing our operations, and I know that this will continue in the year ahead. I'll now turn the call over to Devina to discuss our 2021 financial results and 2022 financial outlook in further detail.\n\nDevina A. Rankin\n\nSenior VP of Field Operations, Executive VP & CFO, Waste Management, Inc.\n\nThanks, John, and good morning. Our teams worked tirelessly this year to provide essential services to our customers and communities, and we're proud of the results we accomplished together. 2021 operating EBITDA growth of 16.5% was achieved by accelerating collection and disposal core price, capturing robust commercial collection and landfill volume growth, successfully integrating the ADS business and delivering record-high recycling profitability. Controlling our discretionary SG&A spending and leveraging technology investments to reduce the cost of our sales and back office functions also contributed to the strong EBITDA growth in 2021.\nIn the fourth quarter, SG&A was $481 million or 10.3% of revenue. Our fourth quarter SG&A costs came in higher than our run rate due to the timing of some of our technology- and sustainability-oriented investments. 2021 SG&A was 10% of revenue. That's a 20 basis point improvement over 2020. Over the long term, we target SG&A as a percentage of revenue below 10%, so we're pleased to be nearing that target so quickly after the ADS acquisition.\nIn 2021, we captured SG&A synergies from the acquisition ahead of schedule and started to realize the benefits of our technology investments, particularly by optimizing our sales coverage model, growing our digital sales channel and streamlining the customer setup process. We're confident that our technology investments will continue to deliver value as we differentiate WM and reduce our cost to serve, both on the operating cost and SG&A lines.\nFourth quarter capital spending was $774 million, which is above the expectations we had last quarter as we were able to opportunistically accelerate investments in recycling and renewable energy at the end of the year. While we continue to see supply chain constraints, slow delivery schedules and some important traditional solid waste asset categories, we worked diligently to close the year with strong momentum on capital investment to support growing volumes, particularly in our landfill line of business.\nGrowth in both cash flow from operations and free cash flow were particularly strong in 2021. At $4.34 billion, cash flow from operations increased 27.5%, and when excluding the onetime benefit from the required divestitures related to the ADS transaction, our free cash flow grew over 28.5% in 2021 to $2.53 billion. Over the course of the last year, we returned a record $2.32 billion to shareholders, a $970 million in dividends and repurchasing $1.35 billion of our stock. We accomplished all of this while achieving our targeted leverage ratio of about 2.75x, demonstrating that we are well positioned for future growth.\nMoving to our 2022 financial outlook. As John mentioned, we anticipate organic growth in the collection and disposal business of about 6%, which is the high end of our long-term growth target. This revenue growth outlook drives our 2022 operating EBITDA guidance of $5.325 billion to $5.425 billion, and that represents almost a 7% increase in operating EBITDA at the midpoint. As Jim discussed, we are well positioned to allocate our cash both to growing shareholder returns and to increasing growth capital investments in our recycling and renewable energy businesses.\nSetting aside the planned growth investments and focusing on the capital expenditures we plan to invest in the normal course of business, we expect capital spending to be in the range of $1.95 billion to $2.05 billion in 2022. Free cash flow, excluding these sustainability growth investments, is projected to be in the range of $2.6 billion to $2.7 billion. We expect to make approximately $550 million of growth investments in recycling and renewable natural gas projects in the coming year. While these investments will be reported as a component of our capital expenditures and therefore reduce our traditional measure of free cash flow, we see these investments to be similar to an acquisition dollar as they will produce high-return growth as a strong complement to our existing business.\nWhen considering these growth investments, free cash flow is expected to be between $2.05 billion and $2.15 billion in 2022. This free cash flow outlook anticipates an increase in cash interest and taxes of $75 million to $125 million and a modest improvement in working capital.\nOur long-standing commitment to a strong balance sheet and consistent and disciplined allocation of available cash towards growth and shareholder returns continues. Our 2020 (sic) [2022] priorities will be to invest in the business, grow the dividend, fund tuck-in acquisitions with strong returns and buy back shares. Given the Board of Directors' approval of a 13% increase in the 2022 dividend rate, we expect dividend payments to total about $1.075 billion in the year ahead. We also expect to continue our share repurchase program in 2022 as the Board recently provided authorization to repurchase up to $1.5 billion of our stock. While our guidance does not specifically include acquisition growth, we will continue to be opportunistic in pursuing the right deals at the right price.\nIn closing, we are proud of what we achieved in 2021, and we're excited about the opportunities that lay ahead for 2022 and future years. Our team is hard at work so that we can deliver on our commitments to our customers, communities, the environment and shareholders. With that, Faith, let's open the line for questions."

Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the express written consent of WM is prohibited.\nNow I'll turn the call over to WM's President and CEO, Jim Fish.\n\nJames C. Fish\n\nPresident & Chief Financial Officer, Waste Management, Inc.\n\nAll right. Thanks, Ed, and thank you all for joining us. The WM team delivered a remarkably strong finish to 2023, driving fourth quarter operating EBITDA of 15% higher. This accelerated earnings growth led to full year operating EBITDA that exceeded the high end of our most recent guidance range by nearly $25 million and achieved the midpoint of our original expectations from the beginning of the year.\nOur strong financial results for both the quarter and the year were powered by our collection and disposal business. This performance starts with disciplined organic revenue growth that exceeded our expectations. And once again, our success in managing the middle of the P&L really stands out in our results, as our teams continue to make progress in optimizing our cost structure with the help of technology and automation. When you combine our revenue performance with the improvement in operating costs, we saw a widening of our price to cost spread and increased profitability.\nOperating EBITDA margin reached a record 29.9% in the fourth quarter and full year margin expanded 90 basis points to 28.9%. As 2024 kicks off, we're confident that our continued focus on optimizing our cost structure and executing on sustainability growth projects sets us up for another year of outsized growth. We anticipate operating EBITDA growth of 7.7% at the midpoint of our guidance, which translates to more than $450 million, of which $115 million comes directly from our sustainability growth investments.\nWe remain excited about the economic and environmental benefits of our expanded -- of expanding our renewable natural gas and recycling platforms. Our execution is tracking well, and we expect to commission 5 new renewable natural gas facilities by the end of the year, reaching 30% of our run rate renewable natural gas volume growth. We're also on track to complete automation upgrades at 10 recycling facilities and add 3 recycling facilities in new markets in 2024.\nTurning to capital allocation. You'll hear from Devina on this topic in more detail, but I want to stress our confidence in our ability to continue to allocate capital to all of our priorities. This includes investing in our high-return sustainability growth projects, acquiring accretive businesses, and returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.\nOur tuck-in acquisition pipeline is robust, and there are some indications that 2024 could have heightened activity in this regard. We're committed to a disciplined approach to acquiring companies, ensuring that any deals we pursue appropriate returns, particularly given the high returns in our sustainability opportunities.\nIn closing, I want to thank the entire WM team for another great year. We were just at the WM Phoenix opened last week, and I've said before, we work hard for this event to create a representation of the bigger company with a central focus on people and the environment. We've been the title sponsor for 15 years now, and the tournament has been recognized as the largest zero waste sporting event in the world for 12 years running. It makes me proud to see the WM team out there making waste diversion operations run smoothly and demonstrating our sustainability leadership so well. I look forward to working with this great team in 2024 as we continue to drive growth by executing our operating plans and progressing our investments in technology, automation and sustainability.\nI'll now turn the call over to John to discuss our operational results.\n\nJohn J. Morris\n\nChief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President, Waste Management, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jim, and good morning. We're more than pleased with the strong operational performance our team achieved in 2023, showing continuous improvement throughout the year with standout results in the fourth quarter.\nDuring this period, operating expenses as a percentage of revenue improved 240 basis points year-over-year, landing at 60.3% and marking our second best quarterly performance ever. This improvement was primarily fueled by our collection and disposal business benefiting from the robust operating leverage of our strategic cost optimization. Our proactive measures to accelerate and improve cost efficiency include leveraging technology to manage labor, managing repair and maintenance costs, and optimizing our overall cost structure. These initiatives led to a substantial improvement in WM's cost to serve metrics, bringing estimated unit cost inflation to low single digits by the fourth quarter.\nWhen combined with solid results from our pricing initiatives, we greatly enhanced overall margins. Our strong second half performance translated into full year operating expenses as a percentage of revenue of 61.7%, an improvement of 70 basis points. That momentum has carried into 2024 and is evident in our January results even as we face severe weather in some areas we serve.\nTwo of the key cost categories driving our operating improvements are labor and repair and maintenance. On the labor front, this begins with our persistent focus on reducing turnover. In the fourth quarter, we achieved a noteworthy milestone as driver turnover reached its lowest point at 18.4%, showing improvement as the year progressed.\nAdditionally, our strategic automation initiatives are yielding positive results in collection efficiency, with all 3 lines of business improving meaningfully in the fourth quarter compared to last year.\nThe results of our technology and automation investments gained traction in the latter part of 2023, leading to significant strides in labor cost management. We expect this to continue into 2024 as we broaden the deployment of our tools across additional sites.\nTurning to repair and maintenance. With a full [indiscernible] of trucks received in 2023, we successfully removed over 1,000 excess assets from our operation, improve the age of our routed fleet and reduce truck rental utilization by nearly 60% since the beginning of 2023.\nThroughout 2023, our emphasis remained on streamlining maintenance processes, which has resulted in enhanced technician productivity, reduced overtime expenses and diminished reliance on external repair services. This has paid off in the form of lower repair and maintenance costs in both dollars and as a percentage of revenue compared to 2022. We accomplished all this with an unwavering commitment to safety and by enhancing the quality of our fleet. We're proud of the strides we made throughout 2023 and look forward to sustained progress.\nAnother core element of the equation that fueled our strong financial results is disciplined organic revenue growth. Growth from price and volume in the collection and disposal business totaled 6.3% for the year, which outpaced our expectations. Our pricing programs continue to be focused on striking the right balance between maximizing customer lifetime value and increasing price to recover higher costs. Our full year churn rates remain at the lower end of historical range at about 9%, and the year-over-year improvement underscores our consistent delivery of quality service to our customers.\nLooking ahead to 2024, we anticipate sustained momentum in our disciplined pricing programs to result in core price between 6% and 6.5% and yield approaching 5%. We remain committed to maximizing customer lifetime value while securing pricing that exceeds our cost inflation. We have seen that spread improve as 2023 progressed, and we are confident that our teams are poised to deliver another successful year ahead.\nTurning to volumes. Our fourth quarter collection and disposal volume grew by 1.9% on a workday-adjusted basis. Growth was primarily driven by MSW landfill and commercial collection, 2 bellwethers for demand of our services. Overall growth in landfill volumes was somewhat muted due to the elevated volumes from the Hurricane Ian cleanup in 2022.\nSimilar to recent quarters, residential collection volumes declined modestly due to our intentional shedding of low-margin contracts as we work to ensure that we achieve acceptable returns for all parts of our business. You can see the benefits of this focus because while our residential collection volumes declined, total revenue and earnings in this line of business both improved. It is a winning equation, and we'll continue to execute on this strategy in the year ahead.\nOrganic revenue growth in all collection lines of business remains positive and operating EBITDA continues to grow. In the fourth quarter, new business grew and net services increases remain firmly positive, reflecting our quality of service and focused differentiation.\nLooking ahead to 2024, our guidance anticipates collection and disposal volume approaching 1%, mirroring the performance achieved in 2023.\nAnd finally, I want to convey my appreciation to our frontline teams for their unwavering commitment to delivering safe and reliable service to our customers and communities on a daily basis. It's their efforts that made 2023 successful and laid the groundwork for growth in the years ahead.\nI will now turn the call over to Devina to discuss our 2023 financial results and 2024 financial outlook in greater detail.\n\nDevina A. Rankin\n\nSenior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Waste Management, Inc.\n\nThanks, John, and good morning. Cost optimization was a significant theme in the fourth quarter and throughout 2023.\nOur team was pleased that our collective focus delivered WM's best-ever full year SG&A as a percentage of revenue of 9.4%. The 20 basis point improvement from prior year was realized through investments in customer-facing technology, leveraging enhanced back office systems to become more efficient and a continuous focus on optimizing our spend. We're pleased with the progress made to improve this measure, while at the same time, investing in our talent, customer engagement channels and technology capabilities.\nSG&A optimization delivered 20 basis points of our 90 basis point expansion in adjusted operating EBITDA margin in 2023. The remaining 70 basis points was from the collection and disposal business which benefited from a combination of fuel price impacts and operating efficiencies. We gained meaningful traction in optimizing labor efficiency and repair and maintenance costs in our collection and disposal business in the back half of the year, lifting our full year adjusted operating EBITDA margin to 28.9%. This result is 30 basis points ahead of the high end of our expectations and positions us to continue to deliver margin expansion in the year ahead.\nOur operating performance translated into robust cash flow in 2023. Our full year cash flow from operations grew to $4.79 billion, and our free cash flow before sustainability growth investments was nearly $2.7 billion. Each of these cash flow measures finished the year near the high end of our initial guidance range. This result demonstrates our strong earnings growth, effective management of interest and taxes and optimizing cash conversion and our disciplined capital expenditure management processes.\nDuring 2023, we returned $2.44 billion to shareholders, paying $1.14 billion in dividends and repurchasing $1.3 billion of our stock. In addition, we spent $173 million on traditional solid waste and recycling acquisitions to grow our business.\nWe accomplished all of this while accelerating our sustainability growth investments for future growth and development, and maintaining our leverage target ratio, our targeted leverage ratio of about 2.75x. Our balance sheet remains strong and our earnings and cash flow growth are robust, positioning us to continue our commitment to shareholder returns and long-term growth.\nMoving to our 2024 financial outlook. We're anticipating total company revenue growth between 6% and 7%, driven by organic growth in the collection and disposal business approaching 6%. Operating EBITDA is expected to grow by $450 million at the midpoint of our outlook.\nWhen we think about the cadence of our growth over the course of the year, we're expecting collection and disposal growth to be weighted more to the front half of the year given the momentum we've gained from strong operating efficiencies in the back half of 2023. And we're expecting sustainability business growth to be more significantly weighted to the back half of the year as our new recycling and renewable natural gas projects come online.\nAltogether, we expect this to result in a relatively balanced operating EBITDA growth over the course of the year. We expect capital spending to support the business for the year to total $2.25 billion at the midpoint, and we expect to invest another $875 million on our high-return sustainability growth projects. Free cash flow before these sustainability investments is anticipated to grow almost 7% at the midpoint to $2.85 billion.\nWe remain committed to investing in an industry-leading network of renewable energy and recycling assets, including renewable natural gas projects, recycling, automation in new markets and advancements in resource recovery. Our sustainability growth investment strategy is progressing well. So as you would expect, there have been a number of refinements to the plan since its inception. We've worked our way through customary changes to project schedules and impacts from inflation, all the while delivering completed projects that meet and sometimes exceed the environmental and economic objectives we planned.\nThese successes have positioned us to grow the sustainability project pipeline. In particular, our refreshed outlook includes 2 new recycling projects in Canada, that WM has awarded through a competitive process. We now expect growth investments across our recycling and renewable energy platforms to total between $2.8 billion and $2.9 billion from 2022 through 2026.\nWe expect these projects to contribute run rate adjusted operating EBITDA of about $800 million by the end of 2026. This outlook utilizes the same pricing assumptions we've used consistently, $125 per ton for recycled commodities and $26 per MMBtu for renewable natural gas. We have a great deal of confidence in the value of the projects that are underway, and we're enthusiastic about the strong complement they provide to our existing business.\nIn conclusion, 2023 has clearly illustrated that we are driving growth through our diligent focus on optimizing our business, investing in technology and automation and growing our leadership in sustainability. We take pride in our accomplishments and look forward to what we can achieve together in 2024. A heartfelt thank you to our dedicated team members who have been instrumental to our success.\nWith that, Josh, let's open the line for questions."

Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the express written consent of WM is prohibited.\nNow I'll turn the call over to WM's President and CEO, Jim Fish.\n\nJames C. Fish\n\nPresident & Chief Financial Officer, Waste Management, Inc.\n\nThanks, Ed, and thank you all for joining us. Our team continues to advance our 2023 priorities, including increased profitability of our business through strong price discipline and an optimized cost structure. As I said in February, 2023 will be a year of pricing and cost control. It's a year of continuing to set ourselves up for the long term by delivering on what we can control. In the second quarter, our adjusted operating EBITDA margin expanded 60 basis points, driven by pricing in the collection and disposal business and diligent SG&A cost control. We delivered this result despite some things that we can control, stubborn cost inflation, slower event-driven volumes and lower-than-expected renewable energy prices.\nNotably, cleanup volumes from Hurricane Ian came in significantly lower than anticipated, which had a $9 million operating EBITDA impact in the quarter. We're pleased with our pricing results for the first half of the year as our team is executing well to ensure that our pricing is keeping pace with the pressure from rising costs. Overall, our volumes are also tracking at or above our expectations, though the mix of volumes across our businesses is different than we had planned. Event-driven landfill and industrial volumes in the quarter were lower than we anticipated, which we see as a short-term moderation in this business. Some customers seem to be taking a more cautious wait-and-see approach regarding the timing of large jobs given the economic backdrop with many anticipated projects moving into 2024. Our pipeline remains strong, so we view this as a temporary shift in project timing.\nThe impact to our special waste and construction and demolition volumes has been mitigated by strong growth in our strategic accounts business, where we continue to differentiate our service offering. We're overcoming margin pressure from this temporary change in volume mix with continued momentum in pricing, optimization costs and efficiency improvements. And you'll hear more from John and Devina about the success we're having in managing our operating costs and SG&A where we had opportunities ahead.\nTurning to recycling. We're now expecting a slower-than-planned recovery in recycled commodity prices in the second half outlook. The investments we're making in automating our recycling facilities position us well in any commodity market environment as they drive lower labor cost, processing costs, improved efficiency and enhanced material quality. In the second quarter, our fully automated recycling facilities delivered differentiated results relative to the rest of the network with 33% lower labor cost per ton and 18% lower total operating cost per ton.\nDuring the quarter, we're pleased to have opened a new recycle facility in the Greater Toronto area, and also completed technology and automation upgrades at an existing facility in Arizona. Recycling is a service with strong customer demand and our intentional shift to a fee-for-service business model as well as our high-return technology investments make it a profitable business for WM in any economic environment, with margins now well above our prior commodity cycle lows.\nOn the renewable energy front, we opened our Eco Vista renewable natural gas facility in Arkansas during the quarter, the sixth WM-owned RNG facility and the second of our 20 planned projects in our sustainability growth program. Last month, the EPA announced its 3-year renewable fuel standard rule, which provides strong demand and visibility to the market for renewable fuel standard credits, or RINs.\nThis robust demand provides support for our blended average pricing assumption of $26 per MMBtu used to develop our investment strategy and strengthens the case for potential upside.\nShifting to our full year outlook. We're updating our 2023 guidance ranges to consider first half results and a slower recovery in commodity prices in the second half of the year. We now expect an adjusted operating EBITDA growth of 5.7% to the midpoint of our guidance range, which is still well within the 5% to 7% long-term growth range that we provided in May of 2019. Devina will walk through the key pieces of the outlook in further detail.\nThe WM team continues to step up to the challenges of each day, while at the same time, progressing investments in our business that positions us to further differentiate our industry-leading asset network and capabilities and reduce our cost structure. I want to thank each of our team members for their hard work and dedication. I'll now turn the call over to John to discuss our operational results for the quarter.\n\nJohn J. Morris\n\nChief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President, Waste Management, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jim, and good morning. Pricing remained a bright spot in the second quarter as we continue to execute on our revenue management programs to recover cost increases and improve margins. Our second quarter organic revenue growth in the collection and disposal business was 6%. This growth was led by core price of 6.9% with collection and disposal yield of 5.8%. We have and continue to emphasize the importance of post-collection pricing, and in Q2, we delivered a yield of 7.5% at our transfer stations and 6% for landfill MSW, both improvements in the growth rates from last year.\nOur team's collective focus continues to be on maximizing customer lifetime value. That focus led to second quarter churn improving to 8.3%. This lower churn has allowed us to convert more core price into yield, driving our full year outlook for collection and disposal yield to increase to more than 5.5%.\nLooking at volumes. Second quarter collection and disposal volume grew by 0.2%. As expected, volume growth was weighted to the landfill line of business with modest declines in the collection business. MSW volumes stood out with an increase of almost 4%. As Jim mentioned, some of our event-driven landfill volumes, particularly special waste tons have been tracking below our expectations and below the very strong levels we saw in 2022.\nOur collection volumes were down modestly in the quarter due to the intentional steps we continue to take to price every contract to achieve acceptable returns as well as the impact of lower volumes from temporary roll-off. Net new business and net service increases were firmly positive and improved from first quarter 2023 levels, underscoring that commercial conditions remain solid. Though collection volumes are down, both revenue and operating EBITDA grew in each line of business, demonstrating that we are prioritizing profitable volume growth. For full year, we continue to expect collection and disposal volumes to be flat at the midpoint of our guidance.\nTurning to operating expenses. We realized benefits from our optimization efforts in the second quarter, leading to 20 basis points of improvement in operating expenses as a percentage of revenue to 62.2%. The improvements that we made in Q2 are being partially offset by higher cost due to inflation. While we experienced some impact of lingering inflation into Q2, signs of easing continued as the quarter progressed. The areas experienced the most pressure are labor costs and repair and maintenance costs. There's cause for optimism in both of these categories. Labor costs have continued to moderate during the second quarter, settling in the mid-single-digit range from the double-digit levels that we have seen over the last year. This improvement can be attributed to better employee retention as evidenced by over 50% fewer driver openings and driver turnover improving 250 basis points compared to the same period in 2022. We have robust strategies in place to optimize labor efficiency, particularly in our collection line of business, which we expect to further diminish these cost pressures as the year progresses.\nWe are seeing the benefits of these efforts as we progress through the second quarter, with June marking the lowest cost to serve month of the quarter. This is a promising sign as we move through the remainder of the year.\nAs noted, another significant factor impacting our operating cost has been repair and maintenance expenses. The effects of not receiving a full allotment of trucks over the last few years are still being felt. However, the good news is we are now receiving more trucks and it's leading to improved costs. Since the beginning of the year, our maintenance cost per unit have either improved or remained stable across all collection lines of business. Similar to our approach to labor costs, we have comprehensive plans in place to drive continued improvement in our repair and maintenance performance as we progress through the rest of 2023.\nOur efforts in these 2 key areas as well as broader operating expense categories give us confidence that we can continue to improve overall operating costs as a percentage of revenue as we progress through 2023.\nI want to thank the entire WM team for continuing to provide safe and reliable service to our customers. I know they're all working hard to deliver strong results through the remainder of this year and beyond.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Devina to discuss our financial results and guidance and further detail.\n\nDevina A. Rankin\n\nSenior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Waste Management, Inc.\n\nThanks, John, and good morning. The first half of 2023 and our revised outlook for the full year is best framed as the story with 2 primary themes. One of executing well on our top priorities to profitably grow our business, and the other of pressure from market factors beyond our control that we are working to ensure we navigate from a position of strength. Our team's diligent efforts delivered 2 particularly strong outcomes in the second quarter. First, revenue growth from price and our focus on cost optimization translated into an increase in collection and disposal operating EBITDA of $95 million or 6.2% in the quarter. And second, SG&A costs as a percentage of revenue improved by 30 basis points to 9.1%, and this is the best result in our company's history. .\nOur commitment to managing discretionary spending and investing in automation to reduce our cost of service is paying off. We're seeing strong outcomes from our investment in a customer experience model that leverages technology to communicate with customers in their channel of choice. Customer feedback has been strong, giving us confidence that with these investments we've permanently reduced our SG&A cost structure, and we will continue to drive improved customer satisfaction that will only bolster customer lifetime value from here.\nOrganic growth in the collection and disposal business and our focus on SG&A optimization delivered 50 basis points of operating EBITDA margin expansion in the quarter. Operating EBITDA margin improved 60 basis points overall. So you can see that these 2 things delivered almost all of these strong results. This is what gives us confidence in our ability to continue to grow margin in the back half of the year and into 2024.\nYear-to-date, cash flow from operations was about $2.1 billion. As expected, higher cash interest, taxes and incentive compensation payments more than offset the benefit of operating EBITDA growth in the first half of the year. We expect to see those impacts lessen in the second half of 2023.\nCapital spending in the first 6 months of the year totaled almost $1.2 billion, with $963 million related to normal course capital to support our business and $270 million of spending on sustainability growth projects. As Jim mentioned, we're pleased with the continued progress on our sustainability growth program with 3 new projects coming online so far this year. However, customary construction and permitting delays for certain recycling and renewable energy projects will push about $200 million of our planned 2023 sustainability growth capital into future years.\nFree cash flow through the first half of the year was $940 million, and free cash flow before sustainability growth investments was $1.157 billion. Year-to-date, we've returned $572 million to shareholders through dividends, and we've repurchased $620 million of our stock. Dividends will total a little more than $1.1 billion this year and we expect to repurchase about $1.25 billion of our shares over the course of the year.\nOur leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 2.8x, which is well within our targeted ratio of between 2.5 and 3x. About 21% of our total debt portfolio is at variable rates, and our pretax weighted average cost of debt for the quarter was about 3.8%. Our balance sheet is strong, and we remain well positioned to fund growth.\nTurning to our updated 2023 guidance. We now expect revenue growth of between 3.25% and 4.25%. The revision from our initial expectations is entirely related to commodity prices in our recycling and renewable energy businesses and the pace of contributions relative to plan for our recycling acquisitions. The key takeaway here is that core price, yield and volume outlook in our collection and disposal business are intact and even performing slightly ahead of our initial expectations. We now expect adjusted operating EBITDA to be in the range of $5.775 billion to $5.875 billion, which is a $75 million decrease at the midpoint. About $50 million of the revised outlook relates to our performance in the first half of the year relative to our plan and $20 million relates to a slower recovery in recycled commodity prices in the back half of the year relative to our expectations.\nThe operating EBITDA shortfall in the first half of the year primarily relates to 3 things: inflationary cost pressure that has taken longer to abate in 2023 than we expected; a softening in event-driven volumes at our landfills; and lower-than-expected commodity prices in our renewable energy business. These are market-driven pressures, giving us confidence that our collective performance on the company's top priorities over the first half of the year delivered the intended outcomes.\nWith the strength of our collection and disposal operations and the success from our SG&A optimization efforts, in 2023, we will again deliver on our target of growing operating EBITDA by 5% to 7% annually. In addition, we expect to expand our operating EBITDA margin 40 to 60 basis points for the year. Both measures demonstrate the resilience of solid waste and the benefits of pricing discipline, focused differentiation and cost optimization to drive long-term growth.\nIn closing, the WM team is delivering well to safely and reliably serve our customers and to optimize our costs. We will deliver another year of strong financial growth in 2023 and position ourselves for continued success on the road ahead. I can't thank our hard-working team members and us for all of their contributions to our success. With that, Michelle, let's open the line for questions."

Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the expressed written consent of WM is prohibited. Now I'll turn the call over to WM's President and CEO, Jim Fish.\n\nJames C. Fish\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Waste Management, Inc.\n\nThanks, Ed, and thank you all for joining us. Our team delivered strong results in the third quarter, growing adjusted operating EBITDA by 11% compared to last year. The outperformance is driven by the strength and resiliency of our collection and disposal business. In a quarter where the preponderance of macroeconomic discussion is centered around signs of a slowing economy, WM's collection and disposal operating EBITDA grew by more than 12% and margins expanded 60 basis points.\nCollection and disposal organic revenue growth was 8.8%, elevating quarterly total revenue -- company revenue to above $5 billion for the second consecutive quarter. The growth was delivered -- excuse me, the growth we delivered was driven by delivered steps to grow revenue and efficiently manage costs, which together, position us to overcome inflationary pressures.\nOur solid results through the first 9 months of the year position us well to achieve the updated guidance provided last quarter, even with a recent downturn in recycling commodity prices. An important contributor to our improving trend in operating expenses and overall cost structure is the strategic decision to leverage, through automation, the tight labor market and high attrition. John will touch on this as he discusses our significantly improved turnover in more detail.\nBy the end of 2022, we will reach almost 1,000 full-time positions in difficult-to-source job categories that we've chosen not to refill, putting us well on our way to reducing our labor dependency by 5,000 to 7,000 jobs. We're pleased to see early benefits from our investments to reduce our cost to serve while also differentiating WM by enhancing the customer experience.\nContinuing on this discussion of our 2023 and beyond strategy, we're very pleased with our investments we're making in both renewable natural gas and recycling businesses. On RNG, we continue to make great progress on building out our new plants as we expect 2023 to be the heaviest capital investment year. We're on track to see meaningful earnings contributions from 2022 and 2023 investments in 2024, with full incremental operating EBITDA contributions coming in 2026, which are conservatively estimated at $400 million.\nOur recycling business not only provides an important service that our customers want and need, it continues to be a profitable business generating solid returns. We worked hard to adjust our business model over the last several years and saw the results of that in the third quarter, particularly in our automated facilities. Our 5 fully automated MRFs are now delivering differentiated results relative to our single stream network, with about 30% lower labor costs, 13% lower total operating costs, nearly double the operating EBITDA margin and most importantly, a 40% improvement in key safety metrics.\nWe're on track to complete 4 automation projects and add one new MRF in 2022. The significant investments that we're making in growing and automating our MRF network are strengthening the business by reducing costs, increasing throughput and improving product quality. As with our R&D investments, 2023 will be the heaviest year of capital spending and the rebuilding of our single-stream MRFs was the biggest increase in incremental earnings coming in 2024 and 2025 as the majority of the rebuild and new MRFs come online.\nAdditionally, as part of our commitment to growing our recycling business, we announced that we are acquiring a controlling interest in Avangard Innovative's U.S. business. The planned acquisition will grow our plastics recycling capabilities by delivering circular solutions for films and clear plastic wrap used commercially. We expect to receive investment returns comparable to our recycling automation investments yet on a more prolonged horizon, given that operations are in the early stages of scaling. We plan to provide a more detailed update during our fourth quarter earnings call once the deal closes.\nAlso on the M&A front, we completed more than $200 million of acquisitions in the third quarter, putting us well on our way to our full year expectation of $300 million to $400 million. We closed 2 nicely-sized solid waste tuck-in acquisitions in Indiana and Arizona during the quarter. These acquisitions are a complement to our existing operations, and we expect to generate solid returns and earnings contribution in 2023.\nAnd finally, I'm pleased to share that earlier this month, we released our 2022 Sustainability Report, providing details on our ESG performance and outlining our new 2030 priorities. These new priorities are strongly linked with our overall company strategy and directly support expansion of our recycling and renewable energy businesses. Even as we celebrate continued progress in our sustainability journey, we're already focused on driving improvements in the future.\nIn closing, I want to thank the entire WM team for their hard work and dedication. We're focused on finishing 2022 strong while continuing to progress our investments in recycling, renewable energy and automation to drive growth. I'll now turn the call over to John to discuss our operational results for the quarter.\n\nJohn J. Morris\n\nExecutive VP & COO, Waste Management, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jim, and good morning. Exceptional organic revenue growth continued to be a key contributor to our strong results in the third quarter, led by collection and disposal yield of 7.1%. Robust core price across every line of business led to third quarter core price of 8.2%, up (inaudible) basis points from the second quarter. We continue to prioritize customer lifetime value in our pricing strategies, and we maintained third quarter churn of 8.7% when adjusted for steps we took to intentionally shed 3 large unprofitable contracts.\nWe remain focused on disciplined pricing in the fourth quarter, positioning us to achieve our full year revenue growth guidance of about 10%. In the third quarter, volume remained at healthy levels as workday adjusted collection and disposal volume grew by 1.7%, including special waste volume growth of nearly 15%. Commercial volume adjusted for the contract losses I mentioned was 1.4%. We continue to grow volumes as our team's focus on differentiating WM as a preferred service provider.\nIn addition, our teams in Florida are rising to the challenges from Hurricane Ian, taking care of their teammates and communities. While there were increased costs from business disruption and property losses in the quarter related to the Hurricane, we are well positioned to handle store and volume as clean-up activity ramped up in fourth quarter. We remain focused on controlling operating costs. Adjusted operating expenses were 62.2% of revenue in the third quarter, in line with prior year. And while we still see high single-digit inflation, our operating expenses as a percentage of revenue in the solid waste business improved 70 basis points compared to last year.\nOver last year, we made significant investments in our people, including proactive wage adjustments, an improved benefit package and increased training. Those investments are paying off as driver turnover improved 410 basis points in the past 3 months, and sequentially, the rate of increase in labor costs improved more than 400 basis points. Maintenance and repair costs remain elevated and are being impacted by the slowdown in truck deliveries, a tight labor market for technicians and higher cost for parts and third-party services.\nThe impact of higher fuel costs increased operating expenses as a percentage of revenue by 50 basis points. This increase was completely offset by the alternative fuel tax credits realized in the third quarter related to the first half of 2022. While cost inflation appears to be easing, the inflationary environment only serves to reinforce our commitment to using technology and automation to reduce our labor dependency across the business and lower our cost to serve.\nAs Jim discussed, we continue to have strong conviction in our recycling business. While global markets drive the value of recycled commodities, the steps we've taken over the past few years to shift around 85% of our third-party volumes to a fee-for-service model provides protection on the downside. So while there is a level of earnings variability, the recycling business is profitable and generate solid returns in any economic environment.\nOur blended average commodity rate in the third quarter was about $94 per ton. We are assuming a blended commodity value of about $50 per ton for the fourth quarter of 2022, which compares to $132 in the same quarter of 2021. These recent commodity market [moves], combined with persistent cost inflation, are expected to be about a $50 million year-over-year headwind to operating EBITDA in the fourth quarter. We're very focused not only managing costs in recycling business but also invest in the automation across our MRF network to structurally lower the cost of processed material and achieve better quality, which further enhances the protections afforded by our fee-for-service model while providing profitability lift even in the toughest markets.\nIn the renewable energy business, we continue to see strong performance with operating EBITDA in the first 9 months growing $24 million. The second of our 17 new RNG plants announced at the beginning of the year is on track for completion at the end of the year and is expected to begin generating revenue in the third quarter following EPA certification to generate RINs credits.\nIn closing, we are very pleased with our third quarter results, and we continue to operate our business with notable focus on disciplined cost control and responsible revenue quality improvements. I want to thank the entire WM team for their invaluable contributions to our success. I'll now turn the call over to Devina to discuss our financial results in further detail.\n\nDevina A. Rankin\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Waste Management, Inc.\n\nThanks, John, and good morning, everyone. As we've seen all year, our team delivered strong results in the third quarter, driven by organic revenue growth, diligent cost management and proactive steps to automate the business. We continue to see improvement in our collection and disposal business as our strategic focus is on fostering a people-first culture and investing in automation, are driving nearly tangible results.\nAdjusted operating EBITDA in the collection and disposal business grew $174 million in the quarter, which contributed to total company operating EBITDA margin expansion of 50 basis points to 28.6%. Performance in the collection and disposal business, net of fuels, drove 120 basis points of margin improvement. Operating EBITDA margins also benefited 50 basis points from the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, which secured alternative fuel tax credits through 2024. These 50 basis points relates to the catch-up adjustment we made in the quarter to recognize the benefits of these credits for the first half of 2022.\nPartially offsetting these very strong results were headwinds of 50 basis points from recycling commodity prices, 30 basis points from the impact of higher fuel costs, 20 basis points from increased technology and automation investments and 20 basis points from damage to some of our facilities and vehicles caused by Hurricane Ian.\nProactive management of SG&A continues to be an important element of our business optimization efforts. In the third quarter, SG&A was 9.2% of revenue, a 50 basis point improvement over the same period in 2021. Through the first 9 months of the year, SG&A was 9.6% of revenue, which is consistent with the full year outlook we provided last quarter.\nYear-to-date cash flow from operations increased more than 4%, driven by operating EBITDA growth of nearly 10%. Cash flow from operations growth is muted relative to operating EBITDA growth due to higher cash taxes, higher bonus payments, a delay in cash benefits from alternative fuel tax credits and some moderation in working capital benefits from last year when we saw significant benefits from our new source to pay system.\nThrough the first 9 months of the year, capital expenditures have totaled $1,725,000,000 with just over $1.4 billion of that related to normal course capital to support the business and the remaining $322 million related to the strategic growth of our recycling and renewable energy businesses. As I mentioned in July, we were starting to see some encouraging signs of improvements in truck deliveries, and we're gaining traction on our sustainability investment project. These early indicators continued throughout the third quarter, and we're pleased with the increased pace of capital investment that our teams have secured. We currently expect this accelerated rate of capital to continue in the fourth quarter, positioning us to finish the year on plan for capital expenditures.\nTurning to our 2022 outlook. Our solid operational performance in the first 9 months of the year positions us to achieve the guidance we provided last quarter. We continue to expect revenue growth of approximately 10% and adjusted operating EBITDA within the range of $5.5 billion to $5.6 billion, which represents an operating EBITDA margin of 28.1% at the midpoint. Our operational performance puts us on track to achieve our free cash flow guidance of greater than $2.15 billion.\nHowever, in the fourth quarter, we now anticipate making an additional cash tax payment of about $100 million related to a 2017 matter. Considering this payment, we expect 2022 free cash flow of between $2.05 billion and $2.15 billion. When we call all of this together, we're pleased to report results that meet or exceed expectations across all key financial metrics. Combining this strong performance with the stability and certainty afforded by a healthy balance sheet, business confidence in our ability to deliver on strategic priorities through the uncertain economic backdrop.\nAt the end of the quarter, our leverage ratio was 2.65x and 19% of our debt portfolio had variable rates. In conclusion, we are very pleased with the company's performance in 2022. We have strong conviction that the investments we are making in growing our sustainability businesses and in using technology and automation to optimize our business are setting us up for future success. The team remains hard at work on delivering a strong finish to the year and setting a solid foundation for 2023. With that, Katherine, let's open the line for questions."

Fish\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Waste Management, Inc.\n\nThanks, Ed, and thank you all for joining us. 2022 was another very successful year at WM. Coming into an uncertain 2022, I wouldn't have predicted that we would grow adjusted operating EBITDA by more than 9.5% for the year, and 8.8% for the fourth quarter, all of our recycling was down $59 million for the year on a sharp drop in commodity prices. That's exactly what happened.\nStrong operational execution and an unweaving commitment to our strategic priorities led to our full year adjusted operating EBITDA growth of $480 million. We achieved this tremendous growth in the face of elevated inflation, a tight labor market and a downturn in the recycled commodity price market. So we're very proud of our results. Our robust operating EBITDA translated into record cash from operations of more than $4.5 billion, which allowed us to return more than $2.5 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.\nAs 2023 kicks off, we're confident that our long-term focus is on sustainable growth, transforming our business through technology and automation are setting us up to meet the changing needs of our customers, our people and our business environment while leveraging our competitive advantages. Turning to our high-level outlook for 2023. We expect to deliver adjusted operating EBITDA of between $5.825 billion and $5.975 billion in the year ahead, representing growth of just over 7% at the midpoint, which continues the trend of robust operating EBITDA growth that we've delivered since 2019. Since then, we've grown operating EBITDA almost 26%. And at a time when the economic outlook is increasingly uncertain, we're pleased to be anticipating another strong year of earnings growth in 2023.\nThe essential nature of our service, our diverse customer base and recurring revenue streams provide stability in times of economic uncertainty. Much of the growth in our 2023 outlook comes from deliberate steps that we've already taken to grow revenue and efficiently manage costs. Overall, we're anticipating between 40 and 80 basis points of adjusted operating EBITDA margin expansion in the year ahead, driven by our collection and disposal business.\nMoving now to our sustainability growth investment. Let me give you an abbreviated overview of the supplemental deck that was posted to our investors' website. The investment in our renewable energy business is a unique opportunity that we simply couldn't afford to mass. You're all aware that since the passage of the Subtitle B and associated air quality regulations in the 1980s and '90s, landfills have been required to install gas collection systems.\nHistorically, we've been collecting our landfill gas, converting much of it into electricity, which provides an earnings stream for us. Fast forward to present day, with landfill gas designated as a renewable resource, we are increasing the value of the gas that's an inevitable byproduct of most landfills. These RNG plants are simply taking gas that's naturally produced from the landfill and converting it into a cash-generating machine with a 3-year projected payback and a far better environmental outcome than the status quo.\nAnd our returns far surpass those of our competition by virtue of our CNG fleet, which today represents 74% of our routed vehicles. As a result, we're better positioned to close the loop and capture extremely valuable regulatory RIN credits. At the same time, the recently enacted Inflation Reduction Act will provide tax credits and benefits that served to amplify the value creation of WM's renewable energy business.\nThe supplemental presentation to the earnings press release provides details on the investments and our projections for cash flow and operating EBITDA growth. But suffice it to say, we view this as a very strong positive for shareholders. We have a number of attractive options for our renewable energy portfolio. Internally, we said there are 3 possible outcomes from this opportunity, good, really good or great. And we're heading down the great path by owning the landfill gas and renewable energy facilities, generating RINs through our CNG fleet and maximizing the value of new tax benefits to increase the resulting earnings and cash flows.\nWe're also advancing our planned recycling investments and have provided more details in the supplemental presentation on our website. Our portfolio of projects to automate existing and build new material recovery facilities have 3 key financial benefits: reduced labor costs, improved product quality that commands a price premium and capacity growth. In the fourth quarter, labor costs per ton at our single-stream automated MRFs improved by 35%.\nThe automation of these plants enable us to reduce 137 positions through attrition in 2022. And in 2023, we expect to reduce labor dependence by another 200 positions. By the end of 2023, we're anticipating about a 15% increase in processing capacity from our automated facilities and new markets. We will host a virtual information session for investors on April 5 to provide even more insight into our recycling and renewable energy growth plans. Devina will discuss our 2023 capital allocation plans in more detail, but I want to emphasize our confidence in our ability to continue to allocate capital to all of our priorities, including investing in these high-return sustainability growth projects, returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and acquiring accretive businesses.\nIn closing, I want to thank the entire WM team for another fantastic year. We look forward to 2023 as we continue to execute on our operating plans and progress our investments in renewable energy, recycling and automation to drive growth. I'll now turn the call over to John to discuss our operational results.\n\nJohn J. Morris\n\nExecutive VP & COO, Waste Management, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Jim described our fantastic results in 2022 and that all begins with our collection and disposal business. In the face of some of the highest inflationary cost pressures, our collection and disposal business delivered double-digit in adjusted EBITDA for the full year.\nDuring the fourth quarter, collection and disposal results were even more impressive as adjusted operating EBITDA grew more than 11% and margin expanded 40 basis points. This momentum sets the stage for continued growth in 2023 and strengthens our conviction that the investments we're making in our people in automation and in differentiating our service offerings are the right decisions. The growth in our collection and disposal business starts at the top of the income statement with robust organic revenue growth. Full year core price was 7.8% with collection and disposal yield of 6.7% and volume of 1.8%.\nAs we work to keep pace with decade's high inflation, our revenue management teams delivered record core price in 2022 in every one of our lines of business, led by 10.5% in our commercial line of business. We talk often about our focus on generating appropriate returns in our residential and post-collection lines of business. And in 2022, we delivered core price of 6.5% in the residential line of business, 6.4% in our landfills and 5.9% at our transfer stations.\nOur revenue metrics demonstrate that our customers' receptivity to our pricing remained favorable through the fourth quarter. Our rollback percentage was almost 400 basis points better for the full year, while new business pricing increased more than 6% in our commercial line of business. The results clearly demonstrate our ability to manage cost pressures through continued pricing discipline and momentum while maintaining our focus on customer lifetime value. As we move into 2023, our disciplined pricing programs combined with the strong momentum from 2022 and are expected to deliver core price of between 6.5% and 7% with yield approaching 5.5%. Our expectation is for strong rollover of '22 price performance.\nGiven the acute inflationary environment in 2022, we increased certain fees that we don't expect to step up again at the same level. We remain committed to securing pricing that outpaces our cost inflation which is demonstrated by the operating EBITDA margin expansion that we're anticipating in 2023. Shifting to volumes, in the fourth quarter, event-driven volumes remained strong with special waste and C&D volumes growing double digits. Our commercial and industrial volumes were positive for the full year. However, we saw some softening in the fourth quarter. Given these recent trends, we are tempering our volume expectations in the year ahead.\nOur guidance includes 2023 collection and disposal volumes that are relatively flat with 2022. We continue to see the rate of labor increases easing in our business, and we remain focused on managing our operating expenses and flexing down costs, flexing costs down with the changing volumes. In our collection and disposal business, we are seeing improvements in our labor costs as inflationary wage pressures are easing. Turnover trends are improving and the investments that we are making in automation are showing benefits.\nThese improvements were on display in the fourth quarter -- in our fourth quarter results as we saw operating expense margin improved by 30 basis points despite still stubbornly higher maintenance and repair costs. For the full year of 2022, operating expenses increased 50 basis points as a percentage of revenue, but that was largely driven by negative impacts from higher fuel costs and recycling commodity prices that together impacted the measure by 80 basis points.\nThis increase was partially offset by lower labor and related benefits costs in our collection and disposal business and improved risk management costs. Putting it all together, when you combine our pricing efforts with our progress on cost containment, we expect 2023 operating expense as a percentage of revenue to improve between 30 and 50 basis points for the full year, with those improvements beginning in the second quarter of 2023. In the fourth quarter, our recycling operating EBITDA remained solidly positive even with the sharp decline in commodity prices to about $47 per ton. Over the last several years, we have intentionally taken steps to shift the business to a fee-for-service model that has reduced our sensitivity to commodity market changes. When we started this journey in 2017, commodity prices were 60% higher than what we are anticipating in our 2023 outlook, yet 2023 operating EBITDA is expected to be about 13% higher than in 2017.\nThis clearly demonstrates that our business model is profitable and generate solid returns in any economic environment. As we look to the future of recycling, we remain focused on advancing automation across our MRF network, which we have proven can lower the cost of process material, achieve better quality while enhancing recycling profitability.\nOur employees delivered strong results in 2022, and I want to thank the entire WM team for their commitment to providing the best customer service while focusing on improving our operations. The team has done an exceptional job, and I know that this will continue in the year ahead.\nI'll now turn the call over to Devina to discuss our 2022 financial results and 2023 financial outlook in further detail.\n\nDevina A. Rankin\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Waste Management, Inc.\n\nThanks, John, and good morning. Once again, our solid waste business was at the center of WM's strong quarterly results, capping off a great 2022. Our team delivered strong organic revenue growth with a diligent focus on leveraging core price to offset cost inflation while prioritizing customer service and customer lifetime value to minimize customer churn, all resulting in record high yield. .\nWhen combined with strong cost control, these efforts delivered an 80 basis point expansion of operating EBITDA margin in the fourth quarter. Importantly, we achieved these excellent results while investing in technology and sustainability growth that will benefit WM for years to come. Full year adjusted SG&A was 9.6% of revenue, a 40 basis point improvement over 2021 as we achieved back-office operational efficiencies through standardization and process improvement that enabled us to reduce more than 600 positions through attrition.\nYou can clearly see our strong performance and the record cash flow from operations that we achieved in 2022, which grew 4.6% to $4.536 billion. The increase in cash allowed us to accelerate investments at year-end, which brought full year capital spending to the high end of our expectations. 2022 capital expenditures totaled $2.587 billion with $2.26 billion of that related to normal course capital to support the business and the remaining $561 million related to the strategic growth of our recycling and renewable energy businesses.\nPutting these pieces together, 2022 free cash flow was $1.976 billion despite an increase in cash taxes of $370 million. During 2022, we returned a record $2.58 billion to shareholders, paying $1.08 billion in dividends and repurchasing $1.5 billion of our stock. In addition, we spent $377 million on traditional solid waste and recycling acquisitions to grow our business. We accomplished all of this while accelerating our sustainability and growth investments and achieving our targeted leverage ratio of about 2.75x.\nOur balance sheet is well positioned for growth through capital investments in our business or strategic acquisitions. Moving to our 2023 financial outlook. As John mentioned, we anticipate organic growth approaching 5.5% from yield. Given an expectation for a little more than 1% revenue growth from acquisitions, and a decrease in revenue contributions from recycled commodity sales and fuel surcharges, we anticipate total revenue growth of between 4% and 5.5%.\nWhen combining our plan to deliver strong organic revenue growth with a focus on optimization and cost control to drive 40 to 80 basis points of operating leverage, we expect to generate adjusted operating EBITDA of $5.825 billion to $5.975 billion in 2023. We expect to allocate $1.1 billion to capital investments in recycling and renewable natural gas growth projects in the coming year. And 2023 is expected to be the peak investment year for each business. While these investments are reported as a component of our capital expenditures, and therefore, reduce our traditional measure of free cash flow. We view these investments as better than an acquisition dollar as they will produce even higher return growth as a strong complement to our existing business.\nOur normal course capital to support our business is expected to be between $2 billion and $2.1 billion in 2023. And free cash flow is projected to be between $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion, including the impact of sustainability growth investments. Our outlook anticipates an increase in cash interest and taxes of $175 million to $215 million and about an $80 million headwind from working capital due in large part to the timing and amount of incentive compensation payments. As Jim discussed, even as we step up our investment in high-return recycling and renewable energy growth projects, we remain well positioned to allocate our cash among all of our capital allocation priorities, including returning cash to our shareholders.\nGiven the Board of Directors intended 7.7% increase in the 2023 dividend rate, we expect dividend payments to total about $1.1 billion in the year ahead. We also expect to continue our share repurchase program in 2023 as the Board recently provided authorization to repurchase up to $1.5 billion of our stock. While our guidance does not specifically include acquisition growth, we will continue to be opportunistic in pursuing the right deals at the right price. In closing, we are proud of what we achieved in 2022, and we're excited about the opportunities that lay ahead for 2023 and future years. I want to thank our hard-working team members for all of their contributions to our success.\nWith that, Josh, let's open the line for questions."

Any redistribution, retransmission, or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the express written consent of WM is prohibited. Now I'll turn the call over to WM's President and CEO, Jim Fish.\n\nJames C. Fish\n\nPresident & Chief Financial Officer, Waste Management, Inc.\n\nAll right. Thanks, Ed, and thank you all for joining us. The WM team delivered another quarter of strong financial results to start 2024, powered by outstanding operational performance in the collection and disposal business. Total company operating EBITDA grew nearly 15% in the first quarter, and margin expanded 240 basis points, driven by substantial momentum on cost optimization efforts and disciplined execution on our pricing programs.\nLast quarter, we said the areas of strength in 2024 would look very similar to those of 2023, and that was definitely the case in Q1. Continued traction on cost optimization led to our third consecutive quarter of operating EBITDA margin above 29.5%, with Q1 coming in at 29.6% in the historically lowest margin quarter of the year. This margin result exceeded our expectations and reflects the tangible benefits of technology on our operating costs, the sustained effectiveness of our pricing strategy and the substantial progress we're delivering on our sustainability initiatives.\nIt's our track record in these areas that gives us confidence we're positioned to deliver our highest-ever full year operating EBITDA margin between 29.7% and 30.2%, which is more than 100 basis points of expansion from 2023 at the midpoint. Our ability to convert more of each revenue dollar to earnings and free cash flow allows us to raise our prior outlook for both operating EBITDA and free cash flow by $100 million.\nAs we progress through 2024, we're maintaining our focus on 3 priorities: disciplined pricing across each line of business, leveraging technology to permanently reduce our cost to serve our customers, and executing on our strategic investments in sustainability growth. John and Devina will cover more details on where we're seeing traction within the cost structure and where we have further runway, so I want to spend a few minutes on the other 2 priorities, our pricing strategy and the progress we're making in expanding our sustainability businesses.\nBeginning with pricing, we're pleased with the results we've seen from embracing a customer lifetime value model. Our teams are able to leverage customer-specific analysis to understand where a customer is on their journey and design actionable strategies that will extend the customer retention, improve profitability or both. We're confident that we found a winning approach to data-driven decision-making that optimizes price to reflect the value of the services we deliver, the strength of the asset network and our leading commitment to environmental sustainability. Our first quarter results again show that we have the ability to leverage price increases to cover costs and grow margin while also reducing customer churn.\nShifting to our sustainability businesses. During the quarter, we delivered growth projects across the recycling and renewable energy businesses. This includes completing a large recycling upgrade in Germantown, Wisconsin. The updated facility relies on state-of-the-art equipment that reduces labor costs, increases throughput by 20% up to 60 tons of material per hour and improves product quality. We have another 9 upgraded facilities scheduled for completion this year, and we'll be opening 3 new recycling facilities and expanding our industry-leading single-stream network even further.\nAdditionally, we've completed a new renewable natural gas facility this quarter at our DFW landfill in the Dallas-Fort Worth market, and we remain on track to commission another 4 new renewable natural gas facilities in 2024. We're also excited to announce that WM was just named the official sustainability partner of Major League Baseball. WM's work with MLB is the first collaboration of its kind between an environmental services company and a professional sports league team -- sports team league. With this partnership, we have the opportunity to offer services to all 30 MLB clubs in the United States and Canada. We expect to leverage our expertise to build comprehensive plans to improve the environmental impact of Major League Baseball and its clubs.\nIn closing, I want to thank our WM team for all their hard work during the quarter. I'm immensely proud of their dedication and execution, which have helped achieve such strong financial results. And I'll now turn the call over to John to discuss our operational results.\n\nJohn J. Morris\n\nChief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President, Waste Management, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jim, and good morning. In the first quarter, operating expenses as a percentage of revenue improved 210 basis points year-over-year to 60.9%, continuing the positive trend of our disciplined management of operating costs, particularly in our collection business. Through strategic investments in innovative solutions and process optimization, we delivered improvements in operational efficiency, extracted costs, and setting a new standard for managing the middle of the P&L. Combining this strong operating expense performance with the disciplined pricing performance Jim described, we greatly enhanced overall operating EBITDA margins.\nIn the first quarter, operating EBITDA in our collection and disposal business grew $212 million, and margin expanded 310 basis points to 36.6%. As we continue our journey of automation and optimization, we remain committed to harnessing the power of technology to drive sustainable growth, further reduce costs and improve profitability. In the first quarter of 2024, our continued adoption of technology and automation initiatives led to substantial reductions in both labor costs and repair and maintenance expenses. On the labor front, efficiency in all 3 of our collection lines of business improved meaningfully from the first quarter of 2023 as our implementation continues to gain traction.\nAs an example, we're seeing nice improvements in performance from our routing efficiency program, next day optimization, or NDO, in our industrial line of business. This tool allows us to more dynamically route and it improves our efficiency, which is reducing our cost to serve and improving our asset planning. Currently, we have deployed NDO at 92% of our collection sites, and the majority of those are already achieving or exceeding efficiency targets. Additionally, we are achieving great results in the automation of our residential routes. Through Q1, we have automated over 650 routes and removed almost 800 rear load trucks since 2022. This has led to upwards of a 30% efficiency gain and residential EBITDA margins approaching 20%.\nThe integration of these technology investments, coupled with the benefits of improved driver retention, have resulted in a 135 basis point improvement in labor costs as a percentage of revenue. In the first quarter of 2024, driver turnover improved to about 18%, down from over 22% a year ago. We expect ongoing benefits from continued moderation in inflation as well as the investments we're making in our people and processes as we progress through the year.\nTurning to repair and maintenance. In the first quarter, repair and maintenance spending decreased year-over-year for the first time in several years, and spending as a percentage of revenue improved 50 basis points. In addition to our strong process discipline, we are also leveraging technology to reduce these costs. These technologies have enabled us to digitize much of our workflow, beginning with all of our technicians who now have portable technology in their hands. These tools facilitate our ability to assign and track work, drive technician efficiency, reduce downtime, and improve asset utilization. Our results are encouraging, and we see further runway to optimize repair and maintenance costs in the future.\nIn addition to great operating cost performance, we continued to deliver top line growth primarily through disciplined execution on our pricing programs. Our customer lifetime value model continues to drive strong organic revenue growth, and our sales metrics in the quarter are a clear indication of our success in profitably growing the collection and disposal business. Churn was near the lowest rate that we've ever seen at 8.5%. New business improved 16% and continues to outpace lost business. Rollbacks remain in the low double digits. Net service increases remained positive, and our net promoter score improved by almost 12% year-over-year.\nLooking at revenue growth, as Jim said, we've seen a strong start to the year in pricing. Volume has been relatively consistent with our original expectations, with the exception of our temporary roll-off business. The softness in this volume category reflects some slowness in the homebuilding and industrial segments of the macro economy. C&D was also impacted with the lapping of volumes related to Hurricane Ian cleanup last year. With that said, our 2 bellwethers for demand, commercial collection and MSW volumes were positive in the quarter, and we also experienced a nice uptick in special waste tons in the quarter.\nFor the full year, we now expect total revenue growth of between 5% and 5.75%. The revision from our prior expectation is driven by 2 things: the softer temporary roll-off volumes mentioned; and a lower outlook for energy surcharge revenue, given the decline in the average diesel cost relative to our expectations. Our pricing remains on track, and in some lines of business, ahead of our original expectations. Our teams delivered outstanding performance in the first quarter, and I can't thank them enough for all their contributions to our success. I'll now turn the call over to Devina to discuss our first quarter financial results in further detail.\n\nDevina A. Rankin\n\nSenior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Waste Management, Inc.\n\nThanks, John, and good morning. Growing our adjusted operating EBITDA margin by 240 basis points in the first quarter stands out as the best indicator of WM's strong start to the year. As John discussed, the lion's share of this margin expansion came from the optimization of our operating performance in the collection business, with labor efficiency and improved repair and maintenance costs driving a 270 basis point improvement in our total company margin from the core.\nOur continued focus on managing our back office spending also contributed 20 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter, with SG&A as a percentage of revenue coming in at 9.5%. Commodity impacts in the quarter largely offset each other as fuel price impacts benefited margin by about 40 basis points, and recycling results decreased margin by about 30 basis points, primarily from the impact of higher recycled commodity pricing in the brokerage business.\nThe remainder of the margin bridge from Q1 of 2023 to Q1 of 2024 relates to a headwind of about 60 basis points from the combined impacts of incentive compensation and costs incurred by our corporate team to drive adoption of our optimization programs. Our strong margin and earnings, combined with benefits from working capital and lower cash incentive compensation payments, led to robust growth in first quarter cash from operations. We're starting the year strong with cash flow from operations as a percentage of revenue up over 500 basis points to 26.5%, demonstrating the value of our margin expansion to growing the company's cash flow yield.\nCapital expenditures totaled $668 million in the quarter, with both capital spending to support the base business and our investments in sustainability growth tracking as planned. Our first quarter free cash flow of [ $714 million ] allowed us to invest across all of our capital allocation priorities. We returned more than $550 million to shareholders, paying more than $300 million in dividends and repurchasing $250 million of our stock. In all of this, we still maintained our leverage ratio at our target levels of about 2.6x.\nWith our strong balance sheet and robust earnings and cash flow outlook, we are well positioned to continue our commitment to shareholder returns and long-term growth. Our effective tax rate in the first quarter was 18.6%, which includes a $37 million benefit from investment tax credits related to the development of renewable natural gas projects. As we noted during our fourth quarter earnings call, our original expectation was that we would see a $120 million benefit in 2024 from the ITC. And we now expect $145 million for the full year. We expect this to benefit both our tax expense and free cash flow in 2024.\nAs Jim mentioned, our great start to the year has put us on a higher growth trajectory for the full year than we initially anticipated when we gave guidance last quarter. We're confident that our full year operating EBITDA margin results can exceed the very strong 29.6% we achieved in the first quarter, and that is reflected in our increased outlook for 2024 operating EBITDA and margin. As we think about the balance of the year, we anticipate that outsized earnings and margin growth continues in the second and third quarters from our pricing programs and momentum in operating efficiencies that began late in the third quarter of 2023. We continue to expect that growth in our sustainability businesses will be more weighted to the back half of the year as more recycling and renewable natural gas projects begin operations.\nPulling these points together, we want to emphasize that $85 million of the $100 million increase in our operating EBITDA guidance for the year is attributable to our team's strong execution on driving efficiency and the improved cost to serve in the collection business. The remaining $15 million is related to higher recycled commodity price expectations for the year.\nTo wrap up, we're very pleased to deliver first quarter results that exceeded our own high expectations. Our sustained strong results are a testament to the investments we have made in talent, technology, and assets over the past several years. As always, I want to thank the entire WM team for their focus and dedication to delivering on our commitments to our customers, our communities, and our shareholders. With that, Towanda, let's open the line for questions."

Fish\n\nPresident & Chief Financial Officer, Waste Management, Inc.\n\nAll right. Thanks, Ed. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report another year of outsized operational and financial performance driven by our team's focus on top line growth and cost discipline.\nThis combination, along with our ongoing investments in technology, automation and sustainability have positioned WM to continue delivering long-term value to our shareholders. In 2024, we remain dedicated to optimizing the cost structure, expanding our sustainability platform and enhancing shareholder returns. This focus led us to achieve operating EBITDA growth of more than 10% in our legacy business for the year and achieving 30% full year operating EBITDA margin for the first time in our history.\nOur collection and disposal business led the way, driven by consistent organic revenue growth, disciplined cost initiatives and a continued focus on business mix optimization. 2024 marked a year of significant milestones in progressing sustainability growth investments. We brought 5 renewable natural gas facilities online, expanding our renewable energy platform and further positioning WM as a leader in environmental sustainability. And we're confident in the demand for renewable natural gas, especially from sources like our landfills and in our overall investment thesis for these transformative assets.\nAdditionally, in 2024, we advanced automation upgrades at 10 recycling facilities, improving throughput and lowering operating costs across our recycling network, and added recycling facilities in 2 new markets. These investments are unlocking opportunities with customers and delivering positive environmental outcomes while also putting us on a path to broader long-term financial growth. We're progressing well on the remaining renewable natural gas and recycling projects and expect our growth investments to contribute operating EBITDA approaching $800 million in 2027.\nWe have a great deal of confidence in the value of these projects that are underway, and we're enthusiastic about the strong complements they provide to our existing business. In addition to achieving strong organic growth, across our business in 2024, it was a sizable year for acquisitions, including the successful completion of the Stericycle acquisition in November. Adding Stericycle's leading platform in medical waste management and secure information destruction to WM broadens our suite of solutions, allowing us to more comprehensively serve our customers across a wider range of environmental services.\nOur integration efforts are underway. And in the short 3 months, we've integrated the commercial operations support and back-office functions into WM structures led by our seasoned disciplined leaders. One of our new employees summed up our excitement for this acquisition saying it really feels good to be working for a management team that's looking to grow and optimize the business.\nWe have a well-resourced experienced WM team engaged in making the necessary operational and cultural changes, and we're encouraged by the progress we've made so far. With respect to synergy capture, we now expect $250 million of synergies over a 3-year period, and we're confident we can deliver up to $100 million in 2025. The WM Healthcare Solutions business is expected to grow about 9% before synergies, driven by organic revenue growth and operations initiatives.\nOverall, we remain confident and focused on ensuring a smooth transition for both employees and customers while driving synergies and unlocking value. This acquisition exemplifies our disciplined approach to capital allocation and strategic growth, and we're excited about the long-term benefits it will bring to WM.\nLooking ahead to 2025. We're confident that the momentum we've built will lead to another year of outpaced growth. At the midpoint of our guidance, we expect our collection and disposal business to produce more than 7% operating EBITDA growth in the year ahead even as we face a headwind from the expiration of alternative fuel tax credits. Our disciplined focus on pricing and cost management will ensure that we maintain healthy margins with a positive price to cost spread.\nOur renewable energy and recycling platforms will continue to scale with additional projects coming online and incremental contributions from sustainability investments expected to accelerate this year, adding $150 million of operating EBITDA growth in our sustainability segments.\nCombining all of this, we expect to deliver total company operating EBITDA growth of 15% at the midpoint of our range or nearly $1 billion of growth in 2025 compared to 2024. Before I turn the call over to John to cover operating results, I want to express my gratitude to the entire WM team, including our new team members from Stericycle.\nTheir commitment to our mission and values continues to be the foundation of our success. As we look forward, we're excited about the opportunities ahead and remain steadfast in our goal of creating long-term value for all of our stakeholders.\nI'll now hand it over to John to provide more detail on our operational performance.\n\nJohn J. Morris\n\nChief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President, Waste Management, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jim, and good morning. Before discussing our performance, I want to thank our team for their dedication during the devastating California wildfires. These fires have impacted our employees and the communities we serve, and we're committed to supporting recovery efforts and restoring normalcy for everyone affected. Turning to our results. WM delivered another fantastic quarter to close 2024, reflecting our focus on operational discipline and price execution.\nOperating expenses as a percentage of revenue were 60.3%, marking the fifth consecutive quarter below 61%. Our full year result of 60.7% was below 61% for the first time in WM's history and improved 100 basis points from 2023. This improvement was driven by strong execution by our team as well as automation and technology adoption. Labor efficiency continued to improve during 2024 with labor costs as a percentage of revenue declining by 60 basis points for the full year compared to 2023, which is particularly notable considering the dilutive impacts from the Winter's Brothers and Stericycle acquisitions.\nOur labor cost improvements stem from our commitment to human center leadership, process discipline and importantly, the introduction of technology that allows our operational leaders to spend more time in the field. Our annualized driver turnover as of December was the lowest ever at 15%, marking an improvement of over 300 basis points from 2023.\nAdditionally, advances in route automation and resource planning tools have driven labor savings. Since we started our residential optimization effort in 2022, we have automated over 500 residential routes and exited an additional 400 routes where conversion was not an option or profit margins were challenged. The outcome has been reduced labor dependency while greatly enhanced safety performance and improve customer service.\nCombining these efforts have translated in our residential line of business operating EBITDA margin growing more than 400 basis points and approaching 20% for the full year. We're pleased with the considerable progress we made in 2024 on automating routes, shedding lower-margin business and improving driver turnover and will be focused in the year ahead on maintaining the value we've captured from these efforts.\nRepair and maintenance costs also declined as a percentage of revenue, thanks to increased truck deliveries, fleet optimization, and a streamlined maintenance approach that increased technician productivity and reduced reliance on rental units and third-party services. We remain focused on optimizing our business using data, technology and process discipline to enhance our customers' experience while reducing our cost to serve.\nOur operational achievements, combined with disciplined pricing led to a 10.4% growth in operating EBITDA in our collection and disposal business in 2024, achieving a 37.2% margin for the year, our highest ever. These results exceeded our original growth projections with margins expanding 200 basis points and delivering nearly $700 million in operating EBITDA growth in our collection and disposal business.\nThis is impressive performance -- this impressive performance underscores our team's focused execution of strategic priorities. Our revenue grew across all lines of business supported by a collection and disposal yield of 4.5% and core price of 6.7% with churn remaining at about 9%.\nWe continue to refine the use of data and analytics to maximize customer lifetime value to deliver pricing performance in line with our cost to serve our customers while meeting our margin objectives. Throughout the year, volume grew consistently in our key lines of business, commercial and MSW landfill. Our Workday adjusted volume finished the year as expected and net service increases remain positive.\nFor the year, MSW volumes grew steadily with an observed acceleration in the second half of the year. The 4.4% annual increase in MSW volumes demonstrate the value of our expanding network and logistical capabilities as evidenced by our expanded rail operations serving the Midwest. Special waste also showed positive momentum, indicating growth potential for 2025 as our pipelines remain strong. While our industrial business remains soft, we are rolling out disciplined growth programs to enhance volume capture at appropriate pricing levels, which gives us confidence in our outlook for 2025.\nAs we look ahead to 2025, our focus is on building upon our success in 2024. Our priorities include further improving operational efficiency in our core collection and disposal business and maximizing growth opportunities from acquisitions and sustainability investments. Additionally, our core fleet business optimization and revenue management leadership are now embedded into the WM Healthcare Solutions organization, driving a disciplined integration process.\nWith these efforts, we are confident in our ability to drive continued revenue and operating EBITDA growth while delivering value to our shareholders and customers. At the midpoint of our guidance, we expect sustained momentum in our disciplined pricing programs, resulting in a core price increase of between 5.8% and 6.2% and yielded between 4%, 4.2%, with collection and disposal volume between 0.25% and 0.75% compared to 2024.\nWe remain committed to maximizing customer lifetime value, securing pricing that exceeds our cost inflation and driving disciplined volume growth. In closing, I extend my gratitude to our dedicated team members whose hard work and commitment have been instrumental in our success. Together, we'll continue to build on this year's achievements striving for excellence in all that we do.\nI'll now turn the call over to Devina to discuss our 2024 financial results and 2025 financial outlook in further detail.\n\nDevina A. Rankin\n\nSenior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Waste Management, Inc.\n\nThanks, John, and good morning. We're proud of our 2024 results, building on our commitments to operational excellence, sustainability leadership and shareholder value creation through targeted growth. We improved operating EBITDA margin by 80 basis points for the year. This strong result was driven by margin expansion of 200 basis points in the collection and disposal business, with about 180 basis points from the benefits of price, cost optimization and intentional shedding of low-margin residential business.\nThe remaining improvement in collection and disposal margin was from lower fuel costs. The record growth from collection and disposal business, our collection and disposal business was partially offset by the impact of higher commodity pricing in the recycling brokerage business, increased incentive compensation costs, higher employee health and welfare costs and the addition of Stericycle, each affecting the margin measure by about 30 basis points.\nCost efficiency remained a central theme in 2024. Our SG&A as a percentage of revenue was 9.6% for the full year, including a 30 basis point headwind from the addition of WM Healthcare Solutions. Compared to 2023, we achieved a 10 basis point improvement in SG&A as a percentage of revenue for our legacy business, largely through discipline and discretionary spending and targeted optimization of customer engagement costs.\nOur strong operating performance translated into robust cash flow generation in 2024. Cash flow from operations grew more than 14% to $5.39 billion, and free cash flow before sustainability growth investments reached $3.27 billion, marking a 22.5% increase over 2023.\nThese outcomes highlight our focuses on margin expansion, working capital optimization and disciplined capital expenditure investment. In 2024, we returned $1.47 billion to shareholders, including more than $1.2 billion in dividends. Additionally, we acquired Stericycle and invested about $800 million in tech and acquisitions to expand our traditional solid waste and recycling footprint, all while funding $950 million in sustainability growth initiatives.\nOur disciplined approach to allocating capital prioritizes growing shareholder returns by identifying investment opportunities that will drive long-term growth at attractive returns. The strategic growth of our sustainability business and a targeted investment in health care demonstrate this focus, and we expect 2025 to be a year of outsized operating EBITDA growth as a result.\nAs Jim outlined, we expect to grow operating EBITDA by 15% in the year, which we anticipate translating into robust cash from operations and free cash flow. Capital expenditures for 2025 are targeted at between $3.175 billion and $3.275 billion with about $625 million directed toward high-return sustainability growth projects and about $225 million for our WM Healthcare Solutions business. We expect free cash flow to grow more than 17% to $2.725 billion at the midpoint of our outlook. This outlook includes an anticipated benefit from investment tax credits of about $220 million.\nWM's strong balance sheet and our cash flow growth outlook position us to continue our commitment to sound capital allocation. Our outlook includes $100 million to $200 million of investment in solid waste acquisitions and estimated dividend payments of about $1.3 billion. We've paused share buyback as we expect to focus on getting the balance sheet back to targeted leverage levels with a combination of earnings growth and debt reduction. By the end of 2025, we expect leverage to be approximately 3.1x.\nIn summary, 2024 showcased the strength and resilience of WM's people and our business model driven by our commitment to operational excellence, disciplined capital management and sustainability leadership. I'd like to extend my gratitude to our dedicated team members whose hard work make these achievements possible. We're excited about the opportunities ahead and confident in our ability to deliver strong results for 2025 and in future years.\nWith that, Olivia, let's open the line for questions."

Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the express written consent of WM is prohibited. Now I'll turn the call over to WM's President and CEO, Jim Fish.\n\nJames C. Fish\n\nPresident & Chief Financial Officer, Waste Management, Inc.\n\nThanks, Ed, and thank you all for joining us. Our third quarter results are a testament to our team's ability to deliver on the priorities we set for 2023. And including increasing profitability through disciplined pricing and optimizing our cost structure. Against the challenging backdrop, we've remained focused on the things we can control and this diligent focus is evident in our third quarter results.\nAdjusted operating EBITDA grew by more than 6% and margin expanded 100 basis points to 29.6% when compared to Q3 of 2022. Our strong results in the quarter were powered by our solid waste business. Organic revenue growth in the collection and disposal business remains solid and is tracking well against our expectations.\nThird quarter core price of 6.6% reflects robust price performance across all lines of business. We're also pleased with the resilience of our solid waste volumes as commercial volumes turned mostly positive and special waste growth improved from the second quarter. And what really stands out for this quarter is our success in managing the middle of the P&L.\nWe continue to drive SG&A leverage and we're also gaining momentum on operating cost optimization and efficiency gains. Our long-term focus on using automation and technology to optimize our cost structure is paying off as we're choosing not to replace certain high turnover difficult-to-fill positions. Since January of 2022, we've leveraged attrition and technology to reduce headcount by 1,650 positions.\nWe continue to be focused on the full opportunity of 5,000 to 7,000 position eliminations through attrition and technology over 4 to 5 years, and we're pleased with this progress to date. You'll hear more details about our cost performance from John and Devina. Putting it all together, our focus on price, efficiency and cost control translated into the strong operating leverage we produced in the quarter.\nTurning to our strategic investments in sustainability growth, the investment proposition for growing our renewable energy and recycling business remains strong and our project execution is tracking well. Our seventh renewable natural gas plant and the third of 20 facilities in our growth program is expected to be in service in January. And we have another 4 facilities on track for completion in 2024, including 2 of the largest projects in the portfolio, Fairless in Pennsylvania and Orchard Hills in Illinois.\nOn the recycling front, we've completed technology and automation upgrades at 2 facilities in the quarter. And we have 2 more upgrades at a new facility in Nashville slated to be in service by the end of this year. Our automated network continues to drive great results by pushing our labor and processing costs lower, improving throughput and driving enhanced material quality, which benefits the recycling business in any commodity environment.\nYet again, in the third quarter, we saw materially lower labor cost per ton at our automated facilities at about 35% below the rest of our recycling network. Our investments in developing the blueprint for a modern recycling facility sets us apart within the communities we serve and are unlocking further growth opportunities.\nWith one quarter remaining in the year, we're well positioned to deliver on the 2023 financial outlook we provided last quarter, including adjusted operating EBITDA growth of 6% at the midpoint. We continue to expect a margin run rate exiting the year of about 29%, underpinned by 62% operating expenses as a percent of revenue and 9% SG&A as a percent of revenue.\nWe're pleased with our results through the first 9 months of the year. Our team is very focused on price discipline and cost optimization to deliver a strong finish to the year and lay the groundwork for further growth in 2024. I want to thank each of our team members for their commitment to our customers and their many contributions to our success. I'll now turn the call over to John to discuss our operational results for the quarter.\n\nJohn J. Morris\n\nChief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President, Waste Management, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jim, and good morning. I'd like to open by highlighting the strides we're making in optimizing our cost structure. In the third quarter, operating expenses as a percentage of revenue improved 90 basis points year-over-year to 61.3%. The collection and disposal business contributed 70 basis points of this improvement due to the strong operating leverage provided by our cost optimization efforts. In addition, we achieved pricing leverage as core price exceeded cost inflation by an estimated 100 basis points in the quarter.\nWe're pleased with the progress we've made in managing our labor costs as well as expenses related to repair and maintenance. Our efforts have resulted in a meaningful decline in WM's underlying cost of inflation since the beginning of the year to mid-single digits in the third quarter.\nOur focus on efficiently managing labor expenses is yielding positive results. So far this year, we have automated 141 residential routes and have a target to convert more than 400 routes in 2024. As we shift to more automated routes, we've seen a nearly 14% decrease in the number of helpers needed in our residential business.\nIn addition, our focus on reducing turnover continued to produce improvements in Q3, building on the consistent progress we've made over the past 12 months. Our collection efficiency has also exhibited steady progress throughout the year with commercial, industrial and residential business line showing improvements every quarter. All these focus areas on managing our business are contributing to the improvement in labor costs.\nTurning to repair and maintenance expenses. Despite some lingering effects of inflation and the timing of fleet deliveries were making progress. For the first time in several years, we expect to get an allotment of vehicles that aligns with our fleet replacement strategy with more than 1,200 received to date. This has allowed us to remove older trucks from our fleet and also reduce rental truck usage by over 40% since the start of the year.\nFurthermore, our spending on third-party technicians has been reduced by 2/3 compared to the second half of 2022 and continues to improve. With the progress we've achieved in the third quarter, we believe we've turned the corner on this expense line and are optimistic about ongoing improvements as we close out the year.\nTurning to our revenue growth. We continue to execute on our revenue management programs to recover cost increases and improve margins. Our third quarter organic revenue growth in the collection and disposal business was 5.7% on a workday-adjusted basis. This growth was led by core price of 6.6% with collection and disposal yield of 5%.\nOur differentiated service offering is generating value with our national account customers as well as commercial customers. We continue to focus on maximizing customer lifetime value and our Q3 churn of 9% remains at the low end of our historical range, demonstrating the positive momentum we are seeing with customers valuing our service offerings.\nLooking at volumes. Third quarter collection and disposal volume grew by 0.7% on a workday-adjusted basis. Our landfill business drove most of the volume growth as special waste grew 11.1% on a workday-adjusted basis in the quarter. As a reminder, we do not separate special waste into yield in volume. And in Q3, we benefited from several high-priced projects that drove the increase.\nSo we've highlighted in previous conversations, the timing and pricing of special waste projects is subject to variability due to their discretionary nature. However, our project pipeline remains robust. In addition, Workday adjusted MSW volumes were up 1.7% in the quarter. Our overall collection volumes were down modestly due to the intentional steps we continue to take to price every contract to achieve acceptable returns as well as the impact of lower volumes from our roll-off business. Yet both revenue and operating EBITDA continue to grow in each line of business, demonstrating that we are prioritizing profitable volume growth.\nNet new business and net service increases remained solidly positive and growth in our strategic accounts business driven by our differentiated offerings continues to outpace our expectations. Thus, overall collection and disposal organic growth is on pace for the year.\nWith regard to recycling and renewable energy, our third quarter results were in line with our expectations, and our recently automated recycling facilities are delivering strong results. As Jim discussed, our sustainability growth projects are tracking well and we're confident that our operating EBITDA expectations for the year remain in the range provided last quarter.\nIn closing, I'd like to express my gratitude to our frontline teams for their dedication to providing safe and dependable service to our customers and communities each day. I'll now turn the call over to Devina to discuss our financial results in further detail.\n\nDevina A. Rankin\n\nSenior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Waste Management, Inc.\n\nThanks, John, and good morning. Our third quarter results reflect our continued focus on the fundamental value drivers of our business, disciplined revenue growth and cost optimization. Executing on these fundamentals positioned us to deliver WM's best ever operating EBITDA margin in the third quarter at 29.6%. This is a 100 basis point improvement compared to Q3 of 2022 and it can be attributed almost entirely to 70 basis points of margin expansion in the collection and disposal business.\nSG&A leverage provided the remaining expansion. We're pleased with the team's focus on optimizing costs and reducing discretionary spending, which together positioned us to deliver SG&A costs as a percentage of revenue of 9%, showing that this long-term goal is not just achievable, it is largely in hand.\nWhile the current quarter result has some benefit from lower current year incentive compensation costs, we see this level of SG&A is sustainable, particularly as revenue grows. While there were a number of other margin impacts in the quarter, mostly related to fuel, energy and commodities, these items basically offset each other, giving us confidence that this quarter's results are based on the steps we are taking to price our services above inflation and to permanently reduce our cost structure.\nThrough the first 9 months of 2023, we have expanded operating EBITDA margin by 40 basis points to 28.5%, putting us squarely on track to achieve our full year target of operating EBITDA margin of 28.4% to 28.6%. Our operating performance has translated into robust cash flow from operations.\nThrough the first 3 quarters of the year, cash flow from operations exceeded $3.3 billion, positioning us to deliver more than $4.5 billion of cash from operations for the year. As we expected, cash flow associated with operating EBITDA growth in 2023 has been largely offset by higher interest, taxes and incentive compensation payments.\nDespite these known headwinds, our conversion of revenue dollars to cash from operations and operating EBITDA dollars to free cash flow in the base business were both near peak levels in the quarter, demonstrating the value creation from our diligent focus on optimizing the middle of the P&L and/or capital expenditures. Capital spending in the first 9 months of the year totaled almost $1.9 billion with $1.456 billion related to normal course capital and $397 million of spending on sustainability growth projects.\nWe now expect sustainability growth capital spending of about $750 million in 2023. The $150 million decrease from prior expectations is based on a shift in the timing of spending across the next 2 to 3 quarters. As a result of this lower anticipated capital spending 2023 free cash flow is expected to be $150 million above our prior expectations and in the range of $1.825 billion to $1.925 billion. Free cash flow through the first 9 months of the year was $1.552 billion, and free cash flow before sustainability growth investments was $1.949 billion. We're confident in our ability to achieve our full year targeted free cash flow before sustainability growth investments of between $2.575 billion and $2.675 billion.\nYear-to-date, we've returned $855 million to shareholders through dividends and repurchased $990 million of our stock. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 2.73x, which is at the midpoint of our target ratio of between 2.5 and 3x. 9% of our total debt portfolio is at variable rates, and our pretax weighted average cost of debt for the quarter was 3.9%. Our balance sheet is strong, and we remain well positioned to fund growth opportunities.\nLooking at our full year expectations. Our solid operational performance in the first 9 months of the year positions us to achieve the operating EBITDA guidance we provided last quarter of $5.75 billion to $5.875 billion. This strong result will be achieved with continued focus on pricing our services to recover cost inflation differentiating WM's value proposition with customers to maintain and grow the right volumes and optimizing both operating costs and SG&A.\nWe expect full year revenue growth to be modestly below the midpoint of our July 2023 guidance of 3.25% to 4.25%. Most aspects of our revenue outlook remain intact, but we have seen lower revenue than planned in our recycling brokerage businesses. Given the relatively small operating EBITDA impact from the brokerage business, this refreshed revenue outlook does not impact any other component of our guidance.\nTo sum it up, we're pleased with our performance throughout 2023. We firmly believe that leveraging technology and automation to enhance our operations and investing in our sustainability businesses are positioning us for future success. We're grateful for the hard work of the entire WM team. Their dedication to safely serve our customers and communities will ensure we finish the year strong and move into 2024 even stronger. With that, Victor, let's open the line for questions."

Fish\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Waste Management, Inc.\n\nThanks, Ed, and thank you all for joining us. The first quarter of every year sets the tone for the rest of the year, and our strong first quarter results really set us up for success in 2022. We delivered exceptional core price and yield results, grew profitable volumes and managed our costs. The result was double-digit growth in revenue, operating EBITDA and cash from operations. In fact, our cash from operations was the highest we've ever generated in a quarter, allowing us to return $0.5 billion of cash to our shareholders.\nOur operating EBITDA margin of 27.6% was ahead of our plan, even in the face of record inflation and the delayed approval of the alternative fuel tax credits. So we executed extremely well in the first quarter and achieved better results than we anticipated, positioning 2022 to be another great year for WM. In addition to the strong start in the first quarter, we see signs that the economy is trending positively. Several of the key leading performance indicators within our business, such as special waste volumes, construction and demolition volumes and new business formation pointed to continued strong economic activity and business performance for the balance of the year. The positive economic activity, combined with WM's diverse customer base, the recession-resilient nature of our business and nearly 75% of our revenue that is annuity-like, gives us confidence to reaffirm the full year outlook we provided in February.\nAs we progress through the year, we remain committed to executing on our strategic priorities of providing the best workplace, advancing technology and automation that differentiates WM and reduces costs and leveraging our sustainability platform for growth.\nTurning to our sustainability and technology investments, we're excited about the future. We see the opportunity to further our sustainability leadership by expanding recycling capacity, automating recycling processing and increasing the renewable energy generated from our landfill network. We opened a new recycling facility in the first quarter and we're on track to bring online another fully retrofitted MRF in the second quarter, along with the next WM-built renewable natural gas plant. These projects are expected to generate excellent returns that are superior to those of solid waste acquisitions.\nRegarding technology, last quarter, you heard us discuss cost-saving opportunities for automation and optimization, which involves creating a competitive advantage for WM by differentiating the customer experience, while reducing our labor dependency on certain roles. Through our focus on digital technology, we anticipate reducing 5,000 to 7,000 positions over the next 4 years. In this tight and expensive job market, it makes complete sense to use technology to reduce our dependency on certain high-turnover jobs.\nIn addition to tackling this attrition, technology produces a significant amount of data that we view as a valuable asset. John has referred to our trucks as rolling data centers, and we're using that data and analytics to create a sustainable competitive advantage. Currently, we're piloting the full end-to-end optimization of our roll-off routes, which will be the first of its kind in the industry. Early efficiency results in our pilots are very encouraging and our plan is to have our roll-off routes fully optimized by mid-'23.\nFinally, while we use automation and data to our advantage, we will invest in training and upskilling of our existing employees to ready them for higher-skilled future roles. To sum it up, we've set the bar high in our first quarter with our results, and we're confident in our ability to deliver strong performance throughout the remainder of 2022. I want to thank the entire WM team for their hard work and dedication. I know that they continue to work to deliver on our commitment to our customers, our communities and our shareholders. And we very much appreciate that.\nI'll now turn the call over to John to discuss our operational results for the quarter.\n\nJohn J. Morris\n\nExecutive VP & COO, Waste Management, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. 2022 began on a high note with first quarter organic revenue growth in the collection and disposal business topping 9%. Our expectation was that the first quarter would be our strongest quarter of the year, both for pricing and volume growth, and our teams delivered revenue that exceeded our expectations. Core price of 7.3% is more than double the result for the same quarter in 2021, as we work to secure price increases that keep pace with the inflationary environment.\nStrong pricing results across all lines of business translated into collection and disposal yield of 5.5%, with standout performance of 7.9% for commercial and 5.1% for landfill MSW. We remain confident that our pricing strategies appropriately respond to the rising costs and prioritize our focus on maximizing customer lifetime value. In the first quarter, we delivered record high core price, while maintaining churn near historic lows by using a data-driven and customer-focused approach.\nShifting to volumes, first quarter collection and disposal volume grew 3.8%. Landfill volumes continue to be strong, with MSW volumes increasing more than 5% and special waste volumes growing almost 30% in the quarter. And while we expect some moderation in special waste volumes from our first quarter levels, our project pipelines remain strong. Also contributing to our strong volume results was significant growth in our national account business.\nIn the first quarter, our strategic business solutions team won more than $20 million of new annualized revenue. These wins were driven by our ability to meet customer sustainability and operating needs through a differentiated use of customer-facing data analytics and service capabilities. Our teams remain focused on controlling operating costs. Overall, adjusted operating expenses were 62.3% of revenue in the first quarter. While cost inflation in the first quarter persisted in the high single digits, our operating costs improved 70 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2021, largely due to encouraging trends in our largest cost category, labor.\nFirst quarter overtime costs and training hours came down compared to the fourth quarter of 2021, as we've improved retention and been successful in onboarding new team members to transition from training hours to productive hours. On a year-over-year basis, the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of revenue primarily comes from 3 areas: 50 basis points in our collection and disposal business related to inflationary pressures, including the proactive and intentional steps we took last year to increase wages for frontline team members; 40 basis points from the impact of higher commodity prices on our recycling brokerage business; and 30 points related to the alternative fuel tax credits received in 2021 that have not yet been renewed for 2022.\nWhen we think about the balance of the year, we expect the inflationary cost pressures to ease in the second half of 2022 as we lap acute inflation that began in the second half of 2021. We do anticipate some pressure on maintenance costs in 2022 as a result of delays in our truck delivery schedule resulting from ongoing supply chain constraints.\nTurning to our residential collection business, we continue to execute on our long-term plan to improve this line of business through pricing and automation. The impacts of higher labor costs are most pronounced in this part of the business, and we are focused on appropriately pricing our contracts and reducing our costs by transitioning more of our residential fleet to automated single-driver vehicles. Our first quarter revenue growth results reflect our success in moving residential pricing as our yield was 5%.\nIn the recycling line of business, we delivered another strong quarter with operating EBITDA growing by $23 million. Our blended average commodity price in the first quarter was about $126 per ton, which is in line with our full year expectations. We continue to see strong demand for recycled materials, and we remain focused on educating customers to help unlock additional supply of recyclables and employing technology to maximize the value of the material recovered while reducing our cost of processing.\nAnd finally, our renewable energy business contributed an additional $13 million of operating EBITDA in the quarter. We have a new renewable natural gas plant coming online in the next few weeks in Oklahoma, the 17th R&D plant in our network and the fifth developed by WM. The next RNG project is on track to come into service by the end of the year, positioning us to deliver on our 2026 targets as we expand our leadership in the landfill gas energy business.\nIn closing, I want to thank the entire team for the fantastic job. They do safely and reliably serving our customers day in and day out. We've had a great start to 2022 and look forward to building on our success.\nI'll now turn the call over to Devina to discuss our financial results in further detail.\n\nDevina A. Rankin\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Waste Management, Inc.\n\nThanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Our disciplined pricing programs, robust volume growth and solid recycling performance fueled strong top line growth, and that translated into a nearly 11% increase in operating EBITDA in the first quarter. Our operating EBITDA growth completely flowed through to cash from operations, as lower interest payments more than offset a modest decline in working capital benefits related primarily to higher incentive compensation payments in 2022 for a strong 2021 performance.\nWe're pleased with these strong results and are well positioned to comfortably deliver on our full year outlook.\nTurning to capital expenditures. First quarter capital spending to support our business totaled $371 million, and we invested an additional $47 million in our recycling and renewable energy businesses. Given our acceleration of sustainability growth in the fourth quarter of 2021, we spent a little less capital on these investments in the first quarter, but we remain on track to advance these projects in 2022 as planned. We expect that our investments in recycling and renewable natural gas projects will ramp up as we move through the balance of the year.\nWhile we continue to see supply chain constraints slow delivery schedules in some asset categories, we're managing spending across our portfolio and expect capital expenditures to support the business to be within our full year guidance of $1.95 billion to $2.05 billion and sustainability growth investments to be approximately $550 million in 2022.\nAs you heard from Jim and John, our teams are executing on the recycling and R&D growth projects we discussed last quarter, and we're confident in the strong returns these projects provide. Keep in mind that these investments are reported as a component of our capital expenditures and reduce our traditional measure of free cash flow. Yet we view these investments to be similar to an acquisition dollar as they produce high-return growth as a strong complement to our existing business. Putting it all together, our business generated first quarter free cash flow of $845 million. Before sustainability growth investments, first quarter free cash flow was $892 million, which puts us well on our way to achieving our full year outlook of between $2.6 billion and $2.7 billion.\nWe are well positioned to allocate our cash to sustainability growth investments, traditional tuck-in acquisitions and growing shareholder returns. We used our free cash flow to pay $275 million in dividends in the quarter, and we allocated $250 million to share repurchases, while maintaining our leverage ratio well within our targeted range.\nTurning to SG&A. We remain focused on controlling discretionary SG&A spending and leveraging technology investments to reduce the cost of our sales and back office functions. First quarter SG&A was 10.1% of revenue, a 60 basis point improvement over 2021. We fully expect to achieve SG&A as a percentage of revenue of less than 10% for the full year, even as we continue to invest in technology to differentiate WM and lower our cost to serve.\nIn closing, our strong results are a testament to the dedication of our 50,000 team members. We're proud of our performance in the first quarter and excited about what we can achieve together over the remainder of the year. With that, Lorrie, let's open the line for questions."

Fish\n\nPresident & Chief Financial Officer, Waste Management, Inc.\n\nThanks, Ed, and thank you all for joining us. We're off to a solid start in 2023 with first quarter results delivering on our expectations and keeping us on track to achieve our full year guidance. First quarter revenue grew 5%, with continued strong organic growth in the collection and disposal business of 7%. We're pleased with these results, particularly when you consider the impact of West Coast weather disruptions on our operations.\nWith that said, our first quarter performance was basically on our budget, and our strategic priorities of maintaining strong price discipline, permanently reducing our operating and SG&A cost structure through business optimization, technology and automation and leveraging our sustainability platform for growth are right on track. Executing on these priorities will produce the robust short-term and long-term financial performance that we've projected.\nAs you heard at our Sustainability Investor Day at the beginning of the month, we're very enthusiastic about how the growth in our renewable energy and recycling businesses strengthens WM's compelling investment thesis. We expect the investments that we're making over the next several years to provide meaningful operating EBITDA and free cash flow growth with impressive returns. We remain on track to bring online 2 new renewable natural gas facilities and 7 newly automated material recovery facilities by the end of the year. We're also opening one new MRF in 2023 in the Greater Toronto area, which positions us strongly in the largest growth market in Canada.\nEven as these important parts of our operations grow, our solid waste business will continue to make up the lion's share of our earnings, projected to generate roughly 85% of operating EBITDA in 2026. As a result, our focus on optimizing performance and reducing costs in the solid waste business through technology and automation is critically important and will serve to further separate us from our competition.\nOne excellent example of this is the expansion of our customer self-service capabilities, where we've reduced our call center department costs in the first quarter by more than 20% compared to last year while, at the same time, maintaining or improving our Net Promoter Scores in the commercial and industrial lines of business.\nSo far in 2023, the WM team continues to deliver strong performance. The investments we're making set us up to further differentiate our industry-leading asset network and capabilities. When you combine this strategic with the essential nature of our service, our diverse customer base and our recurring revenue streams, it provides confidence in our ability to continue to reach our strong financial projections over the long term.\nFor the remainder of '23, our outlook remains consistent with the full year guidance provided at the beginning of the year, including adjusted operating EBITDA growth of 7% at the midpoint and between 40 and 80 basis points of adjusted operating EBITDA margin expansion, driven by our collection and disposal business.\nIn closing, I want to thank the 49,000 people behind WM's success this quarter and every quarter. Without this team, none of this would be possible. And I'll now turn the call over to John to discuss our operational results for the quarter.\n\nJohn J. Morris\n\nChief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President, Waste Management, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jim, and good morning. 2023 has started off as planned, and we're pleased to have achieved our first quarter targets. Overall, adjusted operating EBITDA grew nearly 4% and operating EBITDA in the collection and disposal business grew 7% in the quarter. One area that exceeded our expectations was pricing as we continue to execute on our revenue management programs to recover cost increases and improve margins.\nAs Jim mentioned, our first quarter organic revenue growth in the collection and disposal business was 7%. This growth was led by core price of 7.4%, which exceeded both last year and our plan for the first quarter. This strong core price translated into collection and disposal yield of 6.2%, a 70 basis point improvement compared with Q1 of 2022. We saw strong yield performance across all lines of business and are particularly proud of our post-collection yield. We have consistently emphasized the importance of post-collection pricing. And in Q1, we delivered a yield of 8.9% at our transfer stations and 5.4% for landfill MSW, both increases from last year. In fact, the transfer station yield is a new high for that line of business, which is helping to offset increasing cost of labor and transportation. Our collective focus continues to be striking the right balance between maximizing customer lifetime value and increasing price to recover higher costs. We remain confident that we can achieve our full year pricing expectations for core price of 6.5% to 7% and yield approaching 5.5%.\nTurning to volumes. First quarter collection and disposal volume grew 0.8%. Landfill volumes led the way, with C&D volumes up almost 37% in the quarter driven by the hurricane cleanup in Florida, and MSW volumes increased by almost 3%. Special waste volumes moderated in the quarter due to the timing of event-driven work, but our pipeline remains robust, and we believe that those volumes will provide incremental revenue growth as we progress through Q2 and the balance of the year.\nOur collection volumes were down modestly in the quarter, driven by intentional steps we continue to take to price every contract to achieve acceptable returns. This has led to some non-regrettable volume losses in our residential and commercial business. With profitability improving in each line of business and contract wins with healthy price increases, we're pleased to see our differentiated service and disciplined approach to yield benefits. For the full year, we continue to expect flat overall volumes at the midpoint of our guidance.\nTurning to operating expenses, which increased 70 basis points as a percentage of revenue to 63%. I want to frame these results and then talk about the efforts in place to optimize our cost to serve in 2023 and over the long term. There were 2 primary contributors to our first quarter results: the dilutive impact of recent acquisitions and continued inflationary cost pressure. As a reminder, we closed on about $365 million of acquisitions of solid waste and recycling businesses in the second half of the year. Integration costs and upfront dilutive margins of these acquisitions had about a 35 basis point impact in the quarter.\nWhile this impact was a little more than expected, overall, we're very pleased with the progress being made on creating value from these businesses. The remaining impact was due to persistent cost inflation, which was most significant in wages, repair and maintenance and subcontractor costs. The good news is we see signs of easing cost pressures, and the steps we are taking to combat higher costs are also showing benefits. Frontline wage increases are now in the mid-single-digit range as compared to the high single to low double-digit increases that we saw in late 2021 and 2022. And we're starting to see truck orders fulfilled, which benefits every aspect of our cost structure because employee engagement is better, downtime on route is minimized, repair costs to reduce and expensive rentals can be eliminated.\nGetting trucks delivered will also be key to residential automation. As we move from traditional rear load to automated side loaders, we're taking a helper off the back and getting about a 30% productivity pickup, which equates to lower driver technician and truck capital needs.\nWe talked a lot about the work we're doing to optimize our cost to serve. Investments we are making in our people and processes are also important. We're always working to make WM a great safe place to work and delivering our team members a best-in-class compensation and benefits package. One of the benefits we know that comes from these efforts is improved retention, which then translates into even better customer service and optimized cost structure because our tenured drivers are the safest and most efficient.\nIn the first quarter of 2023, we saw the best driver retention we've seen in 2 years. This positions us to drive down our training and overtime hours, improve overall efficiency, and most important, see continued improvement in our safety performance.\nIn closing, I want to thank the entire WM team for the fantastic job they do safely and reliably serving our customers day in and day out. We've had a solid start to 2023 and look forward to building on our success. I'll now turn the call over to Devina to discuss our financial results in further detail.\n\nDevina A. Rankin\n\nSenior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Waste Management, Inc.\n\nThanks, John, and good morning. We're pleased to see our robust revenue growth and disciplined focus on cost control translate into solid operating and free cash flow. First quarter cash flow from operations of $1.04 billion is in line with our plan and a strong result, particularly when you consider higher cash interest and incentive compensation payments. Capital spending in the quarter totaled $660 million, with $504 million related to normal course capital to support our business and $156 million of spending on sustainability growth projects.\nOn the capital front, there are 2 key takeaways. The first is that we're pleased with the continued progress on our sustainability growth projects relative to plan. The second is that truck deliveries are improving. At this time last year, we have received less than 50 trucks. This year, we received about 470. While this is certainly better and shows some easing of the significant supply chain constraints from a year ago, we're still waiting for truck deliveries we planned for 2022. These delays impact our team's ability to deliver on residential collection optimization objectives and targeted improvements in our maintenance cost per driver hour.\nSo while we're encouraged the worst of the recent uncertainty is behind us, we still need to see a more reliable delivery schedule from manufacturers.\nOur business generated free cash flow of $395 million in the first quarter and free cash flow before sustainability growth investments of $551 million, which puts us on track to deliver our full year guidance on this measure of between $2.6 billion and $2.7 billion. Even as we invest in high-return sustainability growth projects within our business, we continue to demonstrate our commitment to all of our capital allocation priorities. We returned $639 million to shareholders during the quarter, paying $289 million in dividends and repurchasing $350 million of our stock. We expect dividends to total about $1.1 billion this year. And with our outlook for strong earnings growth over the remainder of the year in a healthy balance sheet, we expect to continue to repurchase our shares fairly ratably over the remainder of the year.\nOur leverage ratio at the end of the first quarter was 2.8x, which is well within our target ratio of between 2.5 and 3x. About 18% of our total debt portfolio is at variable rates, and our pretax weighted average cost of debt for the quarter was about 3.7%. Our balance sheet is strong, and we remain well positioned to fund growth investments.\nTurning to SG&A. We're pleased with the progress we're making to drive leverage from a more efficient cost structure. In the first quarter, SG&A costs were essentially flat with the same period in the prior year, and spending as a percentage of revenue improved by 40 basis points to 9.7%. These results demonstrate our success in rationalizing costs and optimizing our sales and customer experience functions. We expect our investments to continue to drive improvement in SG&A costs and put us on a path toward a permanently reduced SG&A cost structure.\nOur operating EBITDA margin performance for the quarter was generally in line with our expectations. The 40 basis point margin decline year-over-year is due to 3 things: one, commodity price impacts on our renewable energy and recycling businesses, which created a 50 basis point margin headwind; two, the dilutive impact of acquisitions completed in late 2022, which had about a 40 basis point impact; and three, cost pressure in our collection and disposal business from wage inflation and delayed truck deliveries, which we estimate had about a 20 basis point impact.\nThese margin impacts were offset in part by a 40 basis point improvement in SG&A and a 30 basis point benefit from the timing of alternative fuel tax credit. Our disciplined organic revenue growth and focus on optimization and cost control are expected to drive year-over-year margin expansion for the remainder of the year, particularly in the third and fourth quarters.\nIn closing, the WM team has delivered a solid start to the year, which sets us up for another year of strong financial growth in 2023. I can't thank our hard-working team members enough for all of their contributions to our success.\nWith that, Towanda, let's open the line for questions."

Fish\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Waste Management, Inc.\n\nThanks, Ed, and thank you all for joining us. The strength and resiliency of our business was clearly on display in the second quarter as we built on our first quarter momentum to deliver results that exceeded our expectations. Our teams remain focused on recovering inflationary cost pressures with our strongest-ever core price yield results. Our pricing results, combined with volume growth and sustainability contributions, drove quarterly revenue above $5 billion for the first time. Our robust revenue growth translated into operating -- into adjusted operating EBITDA growth of 7.8%, which is above the upper end of our long-term growth profile of 5% to 7%.\nCash from operations remained strong in the second quarter, positioning us to return more than $0.5 billion of cash to our shareholders to bring the year-to-date total of shareholder returns to more than $1 billion. You'll hear more details from Devina, but our strong start to the year gives us confidence to increase our 2022 outlook for revenue, adjusted operating EBITDA and free cash flow. In the second quarter, we continued to see strong volumes, an encouraging sign for economic activity across the areas we serve.\nCurrently, our key business indicators point to continued positive economic activity. That said, WM is well positioned in any economic environment. Our resilient business model is underpinned by our diverse customer base and essential nature -- the essential nature of our service and the annuity-like characteristics of about 75% of our revenue.\nWe continue to advance our long-term strategic priorities of providing the best workplace for our employees, investing in technology and automation that differentiates WM and permanently reduces our cost to serve and leveraging our sustainability platform for growth. Investing in making WM a great place to build a career while also reducing our labor dependency through attrition and automation together position us to navigate this tight labor market.\nIn our sustainability growth journey, we achieved 2 exciting milestones in the second quarter. We opened our fifth WM owned and operated RNG plant in Oklahoma, the first of the 17 new RNG facilities we announced, that are expected to add 21 million MMBtu of RNG to our renewable energy portfolio by 2026. We expect to complete construction on the next RNG facility by the end of the year.\nOn the recycling front, we brought online our Houston MRF, the sixth redesigned recycling facility utilizing advanced technology to reduce labor and improve product quality. Our advanced technology MRFs are yielding tangible benefits, resulting in about a 30% labor cost savings per ton compared to the rest of the single-stream network.\nIn the second half of the year, we expect to open 2 additional advanced technology recycling facilities and enter a new recycling market, keeping us on track to meet our recycling investment goals.\nI want to take a moment to discuss our capital allocation priorities, particularly related to M&A. Our strong operating EBITDA growth has allowed us to absorb the $4.6 billion acquisition of Advanced Disposal and quickly return our balance sheet to pre-ADS leverage levels. We consider a typical M&A year to be between $100 million and $200 million of acquisitions. This year, we have the strongest pipeline we've had in a long time and expect to close between $300 million and $400 million of acquisitions.\nWe will remain disciplined in our approach to traditional solid waste tuck-in and recycling acquisitions to maintain our strong financial position and generate industry-leading returns. Our cash generation plus our strong balance sheet affords us the ability to allocate capital to our priorities, investing in organic growth and sustainability initiatives, predictably growing our dividends, completing accretive acquisitions and returning cash through share repurchases.\nIn conclusion, I want to thank the entire WM team for their hard work and dedication. I'm excited about the remainder of 2022 as we continue to deliver on our commitments to our team members, customers, communities and shareholders.\nI'll now turn the call over to John to discuss our operational results for the quarter.\n\nJohn J. Morris\n\nExecutive VP & COO, Waste Management, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Once again, we achieved exceptional organic revenue growth in the second quarter, led by collection and disposal yield of 6.2%. Our pricing accelerated sequentially as we continue to address persistent inflationary cost pressures throughout the business.\nSecond quarter core price increased 20 basis points from the first quarter to a record 7.5%. Core price was strong across every line of business, and we had standout performance of 10.6% in our industrial business and 9.4% on in our commercial business. Customer receptivity to our pricing remains strong as second quarter churn, adjusted for the intentional loss of an unprofitable national account contract, was 9%. We remain confident that our pricing strategies are appropriately responsive to rising costs while prioritizing customer lifetime value. Our teams continue to be focused on disciplined pricing in the second half of the year, and we now expect 2022 core price of more than 7% and collection and disposal yield approaching 6%.\nKey indicators in our business continue to signal healthy economic activity in the quarter. Second quarter collection and disposal volume grew 2.3% with commercial volumes growing 1.6% and special waste volumes up more than 19%. Additionally, new business exceeded lost business as service increases continue to outpace service decreases by a wide margin. Second half volumes are expected to remain strong and for the full year, we expect collection and disposal volume growth of about 2.5%.\nOur teams remain focused on controlling operating cost. Adjusted operating expenses were 62.4% of revenue in the second quarter, a 130 basis point increase from the second quarter of 2021. The year-over-year increase in operating expenses as a percentage of revenue was largely driven by fuel and commodity price impacts, 70 basis points from higher fuel costs, 30 basis points related to the alternative fuel tax credits received in 2021 that have not yet been renewed for 2022 and 30 basis points from the impact of higher commodity prices on our recycling brokerage business.\nIn the second quarter, we again saw high single-digit inflation in our costs, and we are managing through this with both pricing and cost controls. Our core price is recovering our cost of inflation in each line of business, except residential, where the impacts of higher labor costs are most pronounced. In that line of business, our conversion of approximately 2,000 railroad routes to automated side loaders will both reduce labor and significantly improve efficiency. This is one of the ways where we are investing in technology to reduce our dependency on certain high-turnover positions.\nAdditionally, early results from our pilot programs to fully optimize our roll-off routes are showing efficiency gains in the range of high single to low double-digit percentage increases. As we move into the second half of the year, we expect inflationary cost pressures to ease on a year-over-year basis given the proactive steps we took to raise frontline wages in the second half of 2021.\nAs Jim mentioned, we're excited about growth opportunities in our recycling and renewable energy businesses, and both businesses continue to deliver strong results. Together, recycling and renewable energy contributed $19 million of operating EBITDA growth in the second quarter. The recycling business is on track to deliver results on par or modestly higher than the record earnings we achieved in 2021. Our blended average recycling stream commodity price was $131 per ton in the second quarter, and we continue to expect a full year average of $125 per ton.\nIn the renewable energy business, better pricing for renewable natural gas, electricity and environmental credits is driving our full year outlook for this business higher than our original guidance by $35 million to $45 million. Overall, our second quarter results exceeded our expectations as we demonstrated our ability to execute on our disciplined pricing programs and manage costs.\nI'm extremely proud of having the entire WM team work together to provide safe and reliable service to our customers. I'll now turn the call over to Devina to discuss our financial results in further detail.\n\nDevina A. Rankin\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Waste Management, Inc.\n\nThanks, John, and good morning. The strong operating and financial results of the second quarter confirmed a number of important indicators we saw emerge in Q1, positioning us to increase our full year financial outlook. I'll cover our updated guidance in a moment, but I want to give a little more color around our second quarter and year-to-date financials first.\nAs John discussed, our results have been driven by robust organic growth, led by our disciplined pricing focus as well as diligent cost management. Proactive management of our SG&A has been an important element of those cost management efforts. In the second quarter, adjusted SG&A was 9.4% of revenue, a 20 basis point improvement over the same period in 2021. We accomplished this result in spite of an increase in incentive compensation due to our focus on controlling discretionary SG&A spending and leveraging technology investments to reduce the customer sales and back office functions. We are on track to deliver SG&A as a percentage of revenue of about 9.6% for the full year.\nOperating EBITDA increased more than $100 million in the second quarter, driven by an increase in the operating EBITDA of our collection and disposal business of $107 million. Operating EBITDA margin in the quarter was 28.1%, a 50 basis point improvement from the first quarter of 2022. We are confident in our ability to achieve our full year margin outlook, which is a particularly strong result given the dilutive impacts from rising fuel costs, which we now estimate could be about 60 basis points for the year.\nYear-to-date cash flow from operations was up $142 million or about 6.5% from the prior year, which has been driven by operating EBITDA growth of over 9%. Cash flow from operations growth was slightly muted relative to operating EBITDA growth due to higher cash taxes, which will continue throughout the year, and working capital pressure that we expect to moderate over the remainder of the year.\nDuring the first half of the year, we've invested $856 million in capital to support the business, and we invested an additional $112 million to support the strategic growth of our recycling and renewable energy businesses. Our year-to-date free cash flow, which includes the impact of capital outlays to support our sustainability growth investments, is $1.35 billion, putting us on pace to exceed the upper end of our initial 2022 guidance of $2.05 billion to $2.15 billion.\nWhile the pace of capital spending has been slower than expected in the first half of 2022, we currently expect truck deliveries, landfill construction and sustainability capital projects to ramp in the second half of the year. We're encouraged to see supply chain constraints in certain asset categories begin to show promising signs of improvement, though we are proactively managing the business in anticipation of the longer delivery schedules we've experienced over the last year. We will revisit capital and free cash flow guidance in more detail next quarter.\nAs Jim discussed, we are well positioned to allocate free cash flow among all our capital allocation priorities. In addition to increased acquisition expectations for the year, we now expect to allocate our full $1.5 billion authorization to share repurchases.\nTurning now to our updated 2022 guidance. We expect revenue growth of approximately 10% and adjusted operating EBITDA in the range of $5.5 billion to $5.6 billion. The $175 million increase in operating EBITDA guidance is driven by more than $325 million from increased price and volume performance and $40 million from better performance in the renewable energy business. Those things are partially offset by approximately $190 million of higher costs, which were driven by a combination of inflation pressure and incentive compensation.\nNote that this outlook assumes fuel prices remain at June levels for the second half of the year, equating to a 60 basis point drag to full year operating EBITDA margin. Even still, we expect to deliver margin of 28.1% at the midpoint of our guidance.\nWe remain optimistic that the alternative fuel tax credits will be approved in 2022 and continue to include the approximately $55 million benefit we would expect to receive in our outlook.\nIn closing, our excellent first half performance sets us up to deliver another year of strong financial growth in 2022. I can't thank the WM team enough for all their contributions to our success.\nWith that, Valerie, you let's open the line for questions."

Any redistribution, retransmission, or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the express written consent of WM is prohibited. Now I'll turn the call over to WM's President and CEO, Jim Fish.\n\nJames C. Fish\n\nPresident & Chief Financial Officer, Waste Management, Inc.\n\nOkay. Thanks, Ed, and thanks for joining us. Our results for the quarter were fueled by strong operating performance in the collection and disposal business. We once again achieved double-digit operating EBITDA growth in the second quarter, keeping us on pace to achieve the full year outlook that we provided last quarter. Quarterly operating EBITDA margin reached 30% for the first time in the company's history, driven by operating efficiencies from technology investments and the sustained effectiveness of our pricing strategy. We're pleased with our performance in the first half of 2024 and are well positioned to deliver another year of strong financial results.\nOur team is executing very well on our strategic priorities, as evidenced by the expected growth in operating EBITDA approaching 10% for the full year. A big part of our strategic approach to growth is to find future opportunities where we can leverage our own expertise, whether it's using technology to improve our routing efficiencies, turning landfill gas into renewable natural gas or automating recycling plants to drive greater throughput and lower operating costs. Each of these recognizes a future need and capitalizes on it.\nAnd now our recently announced agreement to acquire Stericycle presents another opportunity to leverage our expertise to drive higher growth. Stericycle has a leading position in the growing medical waste industry. The planned acquisition adds complementary business platforms to further our leading suite of comprehensive waste and environmental solutions, and these strategic benefits are accompanied by attractive financial benefits. Our team is progressing through the regulatory approval process and integration planning, and we're excited to welcome Stericycle's team members to WM.\nEven as we add medical waste as a new vertical within our business to complement our existing collection and disposal business, we continue to position our solid waste network for future growth. As we've said, the pipeline for solid waste tuck-in acquisition opportunities was strong coming into 2024. Our teams worked hard to move tuck-in acquisitions to completion, and we've now closed more than $750 million of solid waste acquisitions through July. These transactions strengthen our core collection and disposal operations in North America in new geographies like Long Island, New York, and complement existing operations through tuck-in acquisitions in growth markets, in Florida, North Carolina, and Arizona.\nWe also continue to execute well on sustainability, our sustainability growth investments. We expect to bring 5 new renewable natural gas projects online in 2024, adding to the 2 new facilities completed in 2022 and 2023. We have another 9 projects in active construction, with construction beginning -- or expected to begin on the remaining 4 facilities later this year. Momentum is building and we're excited about the progress we're making. Investing directly in building our renewable natural gas platform meets all of our investment criteria. We're driving strong returns with expected payback periods of 3 or 4 years at better multiples than traditional M&A, plus we're expanding environmental benefits by collecting and beneficially using more landfill gas. And we're strengthening our core business by positioning our landfill assets as community energy partners.\nLooking forward, we're exploring the scale of opportunity in future project development and growth from our renewable energy business across our landfill network. At the same time, we continue to maximize the value of the renewable energy we produce through a balanced marketing strategy that leverages the transportation and voluntary markets to secure returns, reduce risk, and manage volatility. These efforts demonstrate our commitment to scaling this unique growth opportunity to create long-term value for the environment and shareholders alike.\nTurning to recycling, our investments in automating our existing facilities and building capacity in new markets is helping differentiate WM with customers, unlocking new opportunities to further expand our network such as recent successes in Ontario. At the same time, our automation investments are providing consistent financial results, improving labor cost per ton by 30% to 35% and increasing the blended value on commodity sales by 15% to 20%. We completed our Pittsburgh and Atlanta automation projects during the second quarter and both facilities ramped up quickly. We're on track to complete another 7 automation projects and add new facilities in New York, Florida, and Portland by year-end. Our progress to date increases our capacity from our recycling investments by more than 1 million tons.\nThe WM story is one of delivering on our commitments. We achieved strong results in the first half of 2024 and are positioned to continue that trajectory during the balance of the year. As we kick off our planning process for next year, we have some early enthusiasm about 2025. Based on all the opportunities we discussed today, we're particularly bullish on the long term. It's our dedicated team that makes all of this possible, and I want to thank them for all of their contributions, and I'll now turn the call over to John to discuss our operational results.\n\nJohn J. Morris\n\nChief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President, Waste Management, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jim, and good morning. We're pleased with our second quarter results, particularly our ongoing optimization of operating costs. Our teams remain intently focused on delivering safe and reliable service to our customers, and I want to thank them for their dedication, especially those in areas impacted by Hurricane Beryl in early July.\nSecond quarter operating expenses as a percentage of revenue improved by 130 basis points year-over-year to 16.9%. This improvement is a testament to our disciplined management of operating costs in our collection lines of business. Combining our strong operating expense performance with disciplined pricing, we significantly enhanced overall operating EBITDA margins. In the second quarter, operating EBITDA in our collection and disposal business grew by $203 million with margin expanding to 37.3%. Our continued adoption of technology and automation was a key driver of these significant operating cost improvements.\nSpecifically, in labor, the use of scheduling and planning tools, advanced mapping technology, expansion of our dynamic routing capabilities, and automation of our residential fleet resulted in improved efficiency across all 3 of our collection lines of business for the second consecutive quarter. In residential, efficiency improved by nearly 6% in Q2, largely due to fleet automation. Our automated routes achieved over 30% efficiency improvement, contributing to a significant increase in residential operating EBITDA margin when compared to last year.\nAdditionally, our people-first focus led to reduced driver turnover, which improved 300 basis points from a year ago. Company-wide, the integration of technology and improved driver retention contributed to a 90 basis point reduction in labor costs as a percentage of revenue. We remain confident in the value of our technology and optimization efforts, and we expect to continue driving labor cost improvements throughout the year.\nTurning to other operating costs. Repair and maintenance spending as a percentage of revenue improved by 20 basis points, reflecting our continued adoption of technology-enabled processes and an improving truck delivery schedule. Lower fuel costs also contributed a 20 basis point improvement to operating expenses as a percentage of revenue. We remain committed to optimizing our cost structure to meet both operational and financial objectives, and we're proud of the results we have achieved so far.\nAnd finally, turning to revenue growth. Our customer lifetime value model continued to drive organic revenue growth from price in line with our full year expectations. Our pricing results relative to plan remain on track, reflecting our team's focus on using customer-specific data and insights to deliver price increases that keep pace with inflation and margin expansion objectives. Churn remains at 9% and service increases continue to outpace decreases, further reinforcing our execution.\nOn the volume front, trends in commercial collection, MSW and special waste remained strong in the quarter and are generally in line with expectations as our C&D landfill volumes when adjusted for the lapping of volumes related to the Hurricane Ian cleanup last year. However, volume in our roll-off line of business is 1 area where we continue to see a bit of softness. Similar to last quarter, we continue to see moderation in both a temporary business driven by homebuilding as well as a portion of our permanent roll-off business in the industrial segment.\nWhile a few segments of our collection volume are trending a bit behind our full year expectations, our disciplined revenue management, combined with our strong execution on cost optimization continue to give us ample confidence that we are positioned to deliver strong financial performance throughout the rest of the year. In closing, I want to thank the entire WM team again for their contributions. Their performance so far in 2024 sets us up for continued success. I'll now turn the call over to Devina to discuss our second quarter financial results in further detail.\n\nDevina A. Rankin\n\nSenior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Waste Management, Inc.\n\nThanks, John, and good morning. We're pleased with the strong start to 2024, particularly when we focus on the 3 most important financial measures we track: operating EBITDA, operating EBITDA margin, and free cash flow.\nStarting with operating EBITDA. Through the first 6 months, we have seen this metric grow more than 12% with all of this growth being organic. This puts us on track to deliver our full year outlook of nearly 10% operating EBITDA growth, well above our long-range annual target of 5% to 7%. As a reminder, in setting our operating EBITDA target for 2024 and then quickly increasing it by $100 million in April, we projected that achieving this year's outsized growth would be driven by 2 things.\nThe first is the benefits of price and cost optimization in the collection and disposal business, which we expected to be weighted toward the first half of the year. And the second is incremental earnings contributions from our investments in growing our recycling and renewable energy businesses, which would be weighted toward the back half of the year. This is exactly how 2024 is tracking, giving us confidence in meeting or exceeding the midpoint of our guidance range for operating EBITDA with our current projection being $6.475 billion. This includes about $20 million to $30 million of incremental growth from tuck-in solid waste acquisitions in 2024.\nTurning now to operating EBITDA margin. It's worth highlighting again that at 30%, Q2 was the best quarterly operating EBITDA margin results in our company's history. In the second quarter, total company operating EBITDA margin expanded 130 basis points, and this was driven by about 200 basis points of margin expansion from price and cost optimization efforts in the collection and disposal business, and then a benefit from the sale of nonstrategic assets of about 50 basis points.\nThese strong margin results were partially offset by higher risk management costs, an increase in incentive compensation costs, and a modest drag from the net impact of recycled commodity prices and fuel. The key takeaway from looking at these puts and takes is that we saw a 200 basis point lift in our core business versus last year. And we see the benefits of employee retention, truck deliveries, and the use of technology and process to optimize the business that started in the second half of 2023 holding.\nThe significant margin expansion and operating EBITDA growth in 2024 is delivering robust operating and free cash flow growth. Through the first 6 months of 2024, we've generated cash flow from operations of $2.52 billion, and that's an increase of nearly $450 million or 22% compared to the same period in 2023. Our double-digit operating EBITDA growth, favorable working capital trends, and lower cash incentive compensation payments are driving this strong performance.\nFor the first half of the year, capital expenditures to support the business totaled $947 million. Sustainability growth investments were about $388 million. Both are tracking at plan that we anticipate spending at or slightly above the high end of our prior guidance of between $850 million and $900 million for sustainability growth investments in 2024. Pulling this all together, we've generated $1.24 billion of free cash flow in the first 6 months of the year, and we're confident that we will achieve our guidance range of between $2 billion and $2.15 billion of free cash flow in 2024.\nAs Jim mentioned, we've closed more than $750 million in tuck-in acquisitions through July, and we look forward to closing the acquisition of Stericycle as early as the fourth quarter of this year. Given our elevated M&A activity, we want to reiterate our capital allocation priorities and emphasize our commitment to a strong balance sheet. WM has a disciplined approach to allocating capital to strategic growth opportunities, including the capital needed to sustain and grow our core solid waste businesses and investments that we're making to grow our recycling and renewable energy assets.\nWe prioritize return on invested capital in making these decisions, and we expect all of our investments to provide healthy returns above our cost of capital. We also remain committed to growing shareholder returns, which includes increasing the dividend as free cash flow grows. We intend to finance the Stericycle transaction using a combination of bank debt and senior notes. When combining the impact of the $750 million of solid waste tuck-in acquisitions with the funding of Stericycle, we now expect our leverage to be about 3.6x post close.\nIn light of this elevated leverage, we're temporarily suspending our share repurchase program so that we can work our way back to our targeted leverage range of 2.75 to 3x about 24 months after the close of Stericycle. The slight revisions in our projected leverage figures since our announcement of the planned acquisition of Stericycle are updates that reflect the impact of layering on the additional tuck-in acquisition activity this year. We're steadfast in our commitment to debt investors and rating agencies because we know the value of our strong investment-grade credit profile.\nTo wrap up, we're very pleased with our strong results, and I know the WM team remains hard at work to deliver on all of our goals for 2024. With that, Livia, let's open the line for questions."

Welcome to the Waters Corporation Fourth Quarter 2021 Financial Results Conference Call. (Operator Instructions)\nThis conference call is being recorded. (Operator Instructions)\nIt is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Mr. Caspar Tudor. Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nCaspar Tudor\n\nManager of IR, Waters Corporation\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Waters Corporation Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Before we begin, I will cover the cautionary language. During the course of this conference call, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the company. In particular, we will provide guidance regarding possible future results of the company and commentary on potential market and business conditions that may impact Waters Corporation over the first quarter of 2022 and full year 2022. We caution you that any and all such statements are only our present expectations, and that actual events or results may differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements.\nFor a detailed discussion of some of the risks and contingencies that could cause our actual performance to differ significantly from our present expectations, see the risk factors included in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, in Part 1 under the caption Risk Factors, and in our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended October 2, 2021, in Part 1A under the caption Risk Factors, both of which are on file with the SEC as well as the cautionary language included in this morning's press release, including with respect to risks related to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business.\nWe further caution you that the company does not intend to update any of its predictions or projections, except during our regularly scheduled quarterly earnings release conference calls and webcasts, or as otherwise required by law. The next earnings release call and webcast is currently planned for May 3, 2022.\nDuring today's call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are attached to our earnings release issued this morning and in the appendix of our presentation, which are available on the company's website. In our discussions of the results of operations, we may refer to non-GAAP results, which exclude the impact of items such as those outlined in our schedule titled Reconciliation of GAAP To Adjusted Non-GAAP Financials included in this morning's press release and in the appendix of our presentation.\nUnless stated otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020. In addition, unless stated otherwise, all year-over-year revenue growth rates, including revenue growth ranges given on today's call, are given on a comparable constant currency basis.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Dr. Udit Batra, Waters' President and CEO. Udit?\n\nUdit Batra\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Waters Corporation\n\nThank you, Caspar, and good morning, everyone. Along with Caspar joining me on this morning's call is Amol Chaubal, Waters' Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nWe've ended a very successful year at Waters. In end-markets with sustainable growth drivers, we have revived our resilient business, and are now focused on growing our portfolio. Despite higher comparables, we saw strong growth continue with an acceleration on a stacked basis as the year went on. The strength we've seen in our instrument portfolio is a positive indicator for the future as our new products have gained traction, and this all supports the sustainable future growth we expect to see in our consumables and service.\nBefore summarizing the quarter and full year, let me start by thanking my colleagues around the globe who represented the indomitable spirit of Waters throughout 2021. We remain focused on supporting our customers and delivering exciting new products despite the challenging conditions of the pandemic. Achieving these results in a normal year would have been quite an accomplishment, but to do so while balancing the continued ups and downs of the pandemic with a major transformation and a new leadership team is indeed quite remarkable.\nNow I'm turning to Slide 3. We have 3 messages. We have a resilient and attractive portfolio of instrument systems, chemistry, consumables and services in end-markets that are supported by sustainable growth drivers. We've revitalized this core by engaging our customers progressing on a number of growth initiatives and continuing to innovate across our portfolio while launching exciting new products. And now we're focused on growth of our core business as well as accessing high-volume applications and faster billing adjacencies.\nI will now provide a brief overview of our fourth quarter and full year operating results as well as commentary on our end-markets geographies and technologies. Amol will then review our financial results in detail and provide comments on our financial outlook. We will then open up the phone line to take your questions.\nMoving on to Slide 4. In the fourth quarter, our revenue grew 6% as reported and 8% on a constant currency basis, reflecting broad strength across our end-markets and geographies with double-digit year-end demand for our instruments and continued growth in our recurring revenue products. This translates to a 7.5% 2-year stacked CAGR for the quarter versus 2019 on a constant currency basis. For the full year, revenue grew 18% as reported and 16% in constant currency as we saw strong growth in 2021 across all our regions led by pharma and industrial end-markets This translates to a 7% 2-year stacked CAGR for the year versus 2019 in constant currency.\nOur Q4 non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share was $3.67 per share, up 1% year-on-year and 7% stacked. Excluding the effect of our prior year COVID cost actions and FX, EPS grew 8% versus last. For the full year, non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share grew 24% to $11.20, and 12% on a 2-year stacked basis.\nNow looking more closely at our top line results for the quarter on Slide 5. In constant currency, first by operating segment. The Waters division grew 7%, while TA grew 16%. By end-market our largest market category: pharma, grew 8%; industrial, grew 7%; and academic and government grew at 5%. In pharma, we saw continued broad-based strength in sales across segments, geographies and applications. Biopharma and contract organizations grew well above 20%.\nIn industrial, growth was led by our TA business, which saw strong global strength in thermal as well as microcalorimetry and biology. Within the Waters Division, we saw broad demand for LC instruments across our geographies as well as our customers -- as well as our customer segments who continue to invest in new capital equipment. Turning to academic and government. We saw an improvement with growth across most of our geographies into the year-end. We're actively revitalizing our relationships with KOLs, which is an integral part of achieving long-term success in academic and government. While it takes some time for us to regain traction, Waters has familiarity and a fan base amongst KOLs who have often used instruments throughout their careers.\nJust last week, I was talking with the head of a leading core lab at one of our -- one of the top medical institutions in the United States. He's worked closely with Waters for the better part of 2 decades to build our proteomics capabilities at this institution and currently has over Waters LCs and 20 mass spec instruments from our company.\nMoving now to our sales performance by geography. On a constant currency basis, sales in Asia grew 9%, with China up 13%, Americas, 8%, with U.S., up 8%; and Europe grew 5%. In China, we saw strong demand throughout the quarter, with growth led by contractors, biopharma and a strong recovery in clinical. We also saw strong growth in food testing and chemical assays. In the U.S., growth came from ongoing strength in our pharma and industrial end-markets In pharma, sales were strong in LC and mass spec, which combined grew in the mid-teens with chemistry up low double digits. In industrial, our TA business saw strong instrument placement across applications, led by advanced materials, chemicals and battery testing.\nIn Europe, all end-markets continued to grow, led by pharma and industrial with food and environmental businesses, resulting in strong demand for our tandem quads. Meanwhile, pharma sales remained solid with growth led by large molecule applications. By product and services, customer demand for our instruments finished the year strong, continuing the trend of instrument growth that we saw throughout the year while demand for recurring revenue products remained strong. Overall, instrument sales grew 12% for the quarter with a robust demand driven by our commercial execution and new product contribution.\nIn LC, Arc HPLC continued to see strong global growth in our core segments as demand continues to ramp. Meanwhile, our ACQUITY and Arc Premier Instruments continue to see strong adoption, driven by applications in large molecule and novel modalities such as mRNA. In mass spec, we saw growth in our high-end tandem quad portfolio led by Xevo TQ-XS, Xevo TQ -- and Xevo TQ-S micro. We also saw strong demand from our biopharma and CRO customers as well as for food safety applications. In our high-res mass spec portfolio, we saw the demand for cyclic with drug discovery applications. We're also encouraged by the early adoption of our new SELECT SERIES MRT time-of-flight platform with customers using it for biopharma, discovery and OMEX applications.\nFor recurring revenues, despite the quarter having 6 fewer days than the fourth quarter of 2020, chemistry sales grew 5%, led by continued high utilization by our pharma customers. Our new MaxPeak premier columns continue to provide incremental growth for our chemistry business. This technology provides important benefits in separation and purification of mRNA, oligonucleotides, peptides and glycans, which is effectively answering the needs of our customers as they work with more complex molecules. Service grew 2% despite a tough double-digit comparison a year ago, with strong growth in both China and in India, which has been a theme throughout the year.\nFinally, TA had another great quarter with sales up 16%, led by strong growth in thermal analysis, microcalorimetry and biology. Demand for TA products continues to be strong in all regions with growth driven by advanced materials and chemicals, including batteries and electronics.\nLooking now at our top line results for the full year on Slide 6. In constant currency, the Waters Division grew 15%, while TA grew 25%. By end-market, pharma grew 19% and industrial grew 15%, while academic and government came at 5% for the year. Pharma, which is our largest market, has grown 10% on a 2-year stack basis driven by strong demand in our instruments and recurring revenues with strength in both large and small molecule applications. We've also seen ongoing strength in our industrial and applied market, which has grown 6% on a 2-year stack basis, led by China as well as North America and Europe.\nIn academic and government, which has been our slowest market to recover, sales in Europe and the U.S. are close to pre-pandemic levels, while China has further in its recovery as university spending continues to be constrained. By geography: Asia grew 19%, China growing 25%, Americas grew at 16%, with the U.S. growing at 14%, and Europe also grew 14%. For the full year, on a 2-year stack basis, our 3 largest geographies, the U.S., China and Europe grew 6%, 7% and 8%, respectively.\nWhat is especially pleasing is that the demand is balanced across all geographies, including a robust recovery in the U.S. By products and services, instruments grew 23% for the year, chemistry 15% and service grew 9%. On a stacked basis, instruments grew 6%, chemistry, 9% and service 6%, showing strong performance above our historical averages. The strength we've seen in our LC instrument portfolio throughout the year remains a positive indicator for sustainable future growth in consumables as well as service. Our growth in recurring revenues has also been supported by the progress we've made in e-commerce as well as delivering higher attachment rates and service.\nGiven the global nature of our business, we are certainly not immune to the ongoing supply chain constraints and inflationary pressures, but we are proactively addressing these challenges, leveraging our global manufacturing footprint and working closely with our customers and suppliers.\nNow moving on to Slide #7. We covered this in our Q3 earnings call, and also at the recent JPMorgan conference, our initiatives across instrument replacement, service attachment contract organizations, e-commerce and new product launch excellence have all been important components for us, regaining our momentum and delivering strong performance in 2021. We've continued to exceed expectations and milestones on these initiatives and believe that each has further runway not just in 2022, but in years beyond, providing an average incremental growth impact of roughly 100 basis points annually across the base business in the next 2 to 3 years as our transformation program is firmly on track.\nMoving now on to Slide 8. The strength of our business is being supported by instrument innovation with recent product launches that have revitalized our core. Waters continues to build on its robust base, deep customer relationships, and importantly, its highly technical team of scientists and engineers with deep understanding of our customers' problems to solve. For example, Arc HPLC, which was launched in 2020, allows customers to increase the performance and capabilities for their high-volume workhorse instruments without revalidating their existing methods. This is absolutely critical in compliant environments, and helps us provide the benefits of newer technology to our customers while ensuring backwards compatibility.\nMeanwhile, our MaxPeak premier technology provides important benefits and applications where sensitivity and reproducibility is key, by virtually eliminating the metal binding affinity of compounds like mRNAs, oligonucleotides, peptides and glycans. On the instrument side, ACQUITY Premier is a UPLC that was custom designed for biologics and novel modality applications. providing 100x better detection sensitivity than non-Premier instruments and a 50% reduction in peak tailing. Within our chemistry portfolio, MaxPeak premier columns, which also offer this high-performance surface coatings, have set a record in terms of uptake for new columns as this technology continues to be well-received by our pharma customers.\nTurning to our mass spec portfolio. One additionally example of innovation is our SELECT SERIES MRT, which is our high resolution, multi-reflecting time-of-flight instrument that provides remarkable accuracy at high speed with outstanding clarity. This instrument is setting the benchmark in mass accuracy. Its high throughput is enabling large sample studies of proteins and metabolites, which previously would have taken too much time to conduct.\nAdditionally, you may have seen our announcement this morning of what is this acquisition of Charge Detection Mass Spec technology. CDMS. CDMS overcomes limitations of conventional mass spec in characterizing analyzing and quantifying complex large molecules. These investments will allow Waters to develop and commercialize CDMS technology to solve significant unmet needs in novel modality settings such as cell and gene therapy for drug development.\nWith the discipline, my colleagues, John Pratt and Jianqing Bennett have brought into launches, new products, have meaningfully grown in their contribution this year. And with our product vitality index, around 150 basis points -- up around 150 basis points to approximately 15% in Q4.\nTurning now to Slide 9. A key element of our informatics strategy is to provide customers with tools that help them better manage their workflows and achieve faster, easier results with high-quality compliant data. Last month, we extended our next-generation informatics platform, Waters Connect to our tandem quad mass spectrometers for core quantitation, starting with food testing. As any scientist who works in mass spec will tell you, current software across the industry is powerful, but designed to fit all purposes, and as a result, can be complicated and difficult to use. Our new software is built around the purpose and end-market application for which it is being used, delivering on our key principle of providing advanced technology that is fast, robust and easy to use.\nIt reduces review times by up to 50% compared to the current market-leading platform by allowing labs to meet their compliance and data integrity requirements. The overriding benefit here is that analysts can reduce review time to a minimum, which is one of the largest bottlenecks in the lab. Improving workflows for quantitative LC-MS and mass-spec data review is critical for our customers as it helps improve the throughput and efficacy.\nI spent time with our launch team last week, and the rollout has begun with food testing applications, and we plan to extend it to other applications in the near future.\nNow turning to Slide 10. Let me turn to the critical problems in higher growth adjacencies that we identified this year, and believe we can solve over time. First, in bio separations, we see an opportunity to take our chemistry expertise from small molecule separation and apply it to novel modalities and large molecule separation.\nDespite their rapid growth, there are significant challenges in characterizing and confirming the quality of these large complex molecules. Take mRNA as an example. The industry has a key unmet need of sustaining analytical control when measuring molecular integrity. Current practices for newer modalities like this are not as reproducible as desired because there is not enough precision.\nSo by advancing our biologic capabilities, we can unleash our chemistry expertise and our engineering expertise to better characterize and separate these molecules and then identify items such as process-related impurities and degradation that are critical in later-stage development and high-volume manufacturing. In this area, specifically, we're looking at bioseparation solutions for mRNA and other nucleic acids, proteins and lipid nanoparticles as well as viral vector gene therapies and vaccines, and adeno-associated viruses.\nSecond, in bioprocess characterization. One of the key differences in bioprocessing versus small molecule processing is that once you define the manufacturing process, you're effectively stuck with it and cannot optimize it without completely revalidating the process because it is tied for the drug master file. By providing analytical techniques that are powerful enough to characterize the product sufficiently, we believe that we can overcome this barrier and separate the process from the product. This is a significant need in the industry and has the potential to be a very attractive market.\nOur partnership with Sartorius is a key step in this journey. And as we bring the processing power of LC-MS applying the BioAccord in a workflow that is simple, powerful and fast and can be easily used on-site by bioprocess engineers. The third application is of LC-MS and diagnostics, where we need a fast unbiased detection of multiple biomarkers to enable early disease detection. We believe mass spec has a significant role to stay here, and they have already demonstrated a proof of concept with the U.K. government in characterizing the SARS-CoV-2 virus with excellent sensitivity and selectivity leading to a lower false positive rate than many other techniques.\nIn review, our strong fourth quarter results capped a very successful year for Waters with broad-based growth across our end-markets and geographies. We sustained our momentum with strong 2-year stack revenue growth throughout the year, with our transformation now embedded in how we operate. Our core business has been revitalized with growing contributions from innovative new products and initiatives. We are laser-focused on our commercial execution. The markets we serve remain in a healthy state, and our regions have rebounded solidly from pandemic lows.\nMeanwhile, we see opportunities in higher growth adjacencies that will raise our exposure to faster-growing market segments as we start to solve the critical problems we've identified over time.\nWith that, I'd like to pass the call over to Amol for a deeper review of the fourth quarter and full year financials as well as our outlook for the first quarter and the full year of 2022. Amol?\n\nAmol Chaubal\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Waters Corporation\n\nThank you, Udit, and good morning, everyone. As Udit outlined, we recorded net sales of $836 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of 8% in constant currency and an increase of 6% as reported. We had a record instrument sales this quarter, which increased 12% versus prior year, and 8% on a 2-year stack basis. Despite 6 fewer calendar days, our recurring revenue, which represents the combination of chemistry and service revenue, increased by 3% for the quarter. Chemistry revenues were up 5% and service revenues were up 2%, both of which had tough comparisons in the prior year. The 6 fewer calendar days in the quarter translated to a growth headwind of approximately 6% for recurring revenue and approximately 3% for total revenue.\nFor the full year, sales grew by about 16% in constant currency and 18% as reported. Recurring revenues grew 11%, with chemistry up 15% and service up 9%, while instrument sales grew 23% driven by strong customer demand and new product introductions. Our 2-year stacked constant currency sales growth was 7.5% for Q4 and 7% for the second half of 2021 versus 6.5% for the first half. This acceleration underscores our good commercial momentum heading into 2022.\nLooking ahead, comparing 2022 to 2021, there is 1 fewer day in the first quarter, no change in the second or third quarters, and 1 additional day in the fourth quarter. Now I would like to comment on our fourth quarter and full year non-GAAP financial performance versus the prior year. Gross margin for the quarter came in as expected at 58%. On a full year basis, gross margin was 58.5% compared to 57.4% in the prior year, with improvements driven primarily by volume leverage, and a 30 basis points tailwind from FX.\nMoving down the P&L for Q4, operating expenses increased by approximately 12% on a constant currency basis, and include an increase of approximately 7% due to the normalization of our prior year COVID-related cost actions. For the year, operating expenses were approximately 18% higher in constant currency, and include an increase of 15% due to the normalization of prior year COVID-related cost actions.\nIn the quarter and for the full year, our effective operating tax rate was 14.4% and 13.8%, respectively. For the full year, our effective tax rate decreased by 100 basis points due to a favorable change in our income mix by jurisdiction. Our average share count came in at 61.4 million shares, which is about $1.1 million less than the fourth quarter of last year. Our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share for the fourth quarter increased 1% to $3.67 in comparison to $3.65 last year. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, and the normalization of prior year COVID-related cost actions, non-GAAP EPS increased 8%.\nOn a GAAP basis, our earnings per fully diluted share increased to $3.52 compared to $3.49 last year. For the full year, our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share was up 24% at $11.20 versus $9.05 in the prior year. On a GAAP basis, full year earnings per share was $11.17 versus $8.36 a year ago. The increase was driven primarily by sales volume, partially offset by the normalization of our COVID-related cost action. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached to the press release issued this morning and in the appendix of this presentation.\nTurning to free cash flow, capital deployment and our balance sheet. We define free cash flow as cash from operations less capital expenditures and excludes special items. In the fourth quarter of 2021, free cash flow was $187 million after funding $45 million of capital expenditures. Excluded from the free cash flow was $9 million related to the investments in our Taunton precision chemistry operations, and $5 million in costs relating to onetime litigation settlement. For the full year, free cash flow was $675 million with approximately $0.24 of each dollar of sales converted into free cash flow.\nIn the fourth quarter, accounts receivable DSOs came in at 66 days, down 4 days compared to the fourth quarter of last year, and down 5 days compared to the last quarter. Inventory DIO decreased by 9 days compared to the fourth quarter of last year. Given higher sales volumes, and our proactive measures to secure supply. Inventory increased by $52 million in comparison to the prior year. We maintain a strong balance sheet access to liquidity and a well-structured debt maturity profile. In terms of returning capital to shareholders, we repurchased approximately 448,000 shares of our common stock for $156 million in Q4. At the end of the quarter, our net debt position was $945 million with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of about 1. Our capital deployment priorities are investing for growth, maintaining balance sheet strength and flexibility, and returning capital to shareholders, along with focus on deploying capital to well thought out, attractive and adjacent growth opportunities.\nNow as we look towards the year ahead, I would like to provide you with our thoughts for 2022, which is on Slide 11. In 2021, our momentum has progressively accelerated driven by robust end-market demand and strong commercial execution across our geographies. As we head into 2022, we expect our momentum to continue and that we will be able to address supply chain constraints and inflationary pressures and believe that our near-term growth initiatives will continue to contribute to our performance. These dynamics support full year 2022 guidance of 5% to 7% constant currency sales growth. At current rates, a negative currency translation is expected to subtract approximately 1 percentage point resulting in full year reported sales growth guidance of 4% to 6%. Gross margin for the full year is expected to be approximately 58%, and operating margin is expected to be approximately 30% to 30.5%.\nWe expect our full year net interest expense to be approximately $35 million and full year tax rate to be approximately 15.5%. Average diluted 2022 share count is expected to be approximately 61 million. Our share repurchase program will continue into 2022, and we'll provide quarterly updates as appropriate. Rolling all this together and on a non-GAAP basis, full year 2022 earnings per fully diluted share are now projected in the range of $11.75 to $12. This includes a negative currency impact of approximately 2 percentage points at today's rates.\nLooking at the first quarter of 2022, we expect constant currency sales growth to be 6% to 8%. At today's rates, currency translation is expected to subtract approximately 3 percentage points, resulting in first quarter reported sales growth guidance of 3% to 5%. First quarter non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share are estimated to be in the range of $2.25 to $2.35. This includes a negative currency impact of approximately 4 percentage points at today's rates. Now I would like to turn it back to Udit for some summary comments. Udit?\n\nUdit Batra\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Waters Corporation\n\nThank you, Amol. In summary, we are pleased with our performance this year. Our core business is reenergized. Our transformation is on track, and we've built really good commercial momentum going into 2022. We're now laser-focused on our commercial execution and accelerating innovation through our portfolio while reaching higher growth, close adjacent markets.\nWith a new leadership team in place and our transformation well underway, we're also expanding our focus on environmental, social and governance topics. We've initiated a complete materiality assessment, which will allow us to look at areas where Waters can contribute, and ensuring we do our part to leave the world better than we found it. I look forward to sharing an update on this later this year. With that, we will now begin the Q&A session. Operator?"

[Operator Instructions] [indiscernible] call that be recorded. If anyone [indiscernible] time. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Caspar Tudor, Investor Relations. Go ahead, sir.\n\nCaspar Tudor\n\nManage of Investor Relation\n\nThank you, Cedric. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Waters Corporation Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. Today, I am joined by Dr. Udit Batra, Water's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Amol Chaubal, Water's Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nBefore we begin, I will cover the cautionary language. I would like to first point out that our earnings release and the slide presentation supplementing today's call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website at ir.waters.com. In this conference call, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the company.

After, we will open up the phone lines to take questions. Udit.\n\nUdit Batra\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThank you, Caspar, and good morning, everyone. I would like to begin today's call by expressing my gratitude to all my colleagues.\n2023 was another transformative year for Waters. Throughout the year, our teams kept an unwavering focus on customers, launched innovative new products and delivered strong business performance, all during highly eventful times with dynamic market conditions.\nAs 2022 ended, the results of our transformation clearly showed on the top line, having delivered several years of very strong above average sales growth. Since then, in 2023, we have demonstrated our ability to manage exceptionally well through a downturn while continuing to make investments for growth.\nIn 2023, we also initiated the next phase of our transformation with the acquisition of Wyatt. This brings with it a new vector for value creation to our shareholders through M&A and we're off to a great start. As an added benefit, it has accelerated our journey into high-growth adjacent markets, where we made continued progress with our organic investments over the course of the year. We launched new and innovative products in 2023, including our Alliance IS next-generation LC platform. We expanded our Xevo TQ mass spec into clinical applications and developed size exclusion columns for viral vectors that bear with wired malls instruments. We even had our first light scattering launch as a combined company with Data Star.\nFinally, we were recognized as 1 of the world's most sustainable companies achieving a variety of ESG awards. This includes our top 5 ranking on Barron's Most Sustainable Companies list, which scores over 1,000 publicly traded companies based on 230 ESG performance indicators. We are very proud of what we've achieved at Waters in 2023.\nToday, as I share our fourth quarter and full year results, I have 3 key messages. First, we've continued to execute well. Second, our transformation is contributing to our results. And third, we are well positioned for future long-term growth.\nTurning now to our results. In the fourth quarter, sales declined 4.5% as reported, which was in line with our expectations. Our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share landed at the high end of our guidance at $3.62 driven by strong margin performance. On a GAAP basis, EPS was $3.65. For the full year, sales declined 0.5% as reported and 2% in organic constant currency. Even with a constrained CapEx environment, all our regions outside of China grew in 2023 in organic constant currency terms. As expected, Wyatt successfully delivered on M&A contribution of 2.5% to sales. And with a strong EPS result in Q4, non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share came in at $11.75, which reflects underlying growth of approximately 2% before FX headwinds of 3% and 1% dilution from the Wyatt acquisition.\nI will now describe our sales results in more detail. The spending environment for instruments remained challenging into year-end. However, Q4 revenue increased versus Q3 levels in all our geographies, even China, as we continue to execute well in tough macro conditions. Reported sales were $108 million higher in the fourth quarter than the third quarter. This reflects a 15% ramp that was consistent with our guidance for a muted year-end budget flush. For the full year, our organic constant currency sales grew 3% year-over-year, excluding China. As I mentioned earlier, the Americas, Europe and Asia, excluding China, all grew in 2023. This took a lot of effort from our sales team who did a fantastic job capitalizing on the available opportunities in the market with our competitive portfolio. As a result, on a 4-year stack basis, our ex-China growth remains at a healthy high single digits.\nA key challenge in 2023 was the abrupt turn we saw in China where conditions deteriorated as the year progressed. This was particularly the case in the pharma market where our revenues are most heavily weighted. For the full year, China sales declined more than 20% overall, which was a 5% headwind to our total growth.\nThis brings us now to our margin performance. We believe that the best reflection of good operational execution is effective margin management when things slow down. During 2023, we saw volume and FX headwinds, while inflationary pressure continued. We responded with stronger pricing and added further discipline to our operational objectives. We redoubled our productivity efforts, including the opening of our Global Capability Center in Bangalore, India. And we undertook proactive cost alignment as the slowdown began to emerge. This resilience focus and commitment allowed us to deliver excellent operational results in our P&L. Our full year gross margin was 59.6%, which is 160 basis points better than the previous year. Our full year adjusted operating margin was 30.9%, which is 70 basis points of expansion.\nNow let me share our progress with the acquisition of Wyatt Technology. The strong start to lead sharing between Wyatt and Waters allowed us to offset a slowdown in biotech spending resulting in an on-target M&A contribution of 2.5% to our full year sales. I will now give some details and how our revitalized portfolio and alignment with higher growth segments are contributing to growth as part of our transformation. Our strong results in 2023 were supported by our innovative portfolio, which helped drive customer spending. Our new products are gaining good traction in the market, including TQ Absolute, Alliance IS, and MaxPeak Premier Columns as well as several of our high-res mass spec instruments such as cyclic G3 and MRT. From an adoption perspective, this puts us in an excellent position when instrument budgets begin to normalize.\nTurning now to our adjacencies. We have continued to invest and expand into adjacent high-growth markets where our business model of solving problems in downstream regulated applications can be deployed. For bioseparations and bioanalytical characterizations, we've made organic investments, launched new products and deployed capital to M&A. Large molecule applications are now 35% of our pharma revenues and expected to trend higher, up from around 20% just a few years ago.\nFor Diagnostics, we have invested in our clinical business and added workflows for specialty applications of mass spec. This has transformed related revenue growth from that of low to mid-single digits to double digits in the past several years.\nFinally, our focus on batteries is paying dividends, where very strong growth has remained throughout the year. Revenues from battery applications are now at over 10x 2019 revenue levels, and our TA business is increasingly aligned with less cyclical faster-growing applications. Each of these exciting growth areas is delivering incremental revenue to the company.\nNow I will share some facts supporting the long-term outlook for above-average growth and provide our 2024 guidance. Since 2010, Waters has grown, on average, 6% in organic constant currency terms. For Instruments, while the standard deviation is high, long-term average growth has been 5%. For recurring revenues, the standard deviation is much lower and the average growth is 7%. As we look ahead, several vectors make us confident that this growth could be even higher. The first is even faster volume growth in segments that we serve, driven by global prescription drug sales and environmental regulations. Second is increased use of analytical instruments for characterizing large molecules and novel modalities. And third, it's about historic pricing where we expect to sustain a 100 basis point long-term tailwind in incremental growth.\nLet's take each of these growth vectors in turn. There are at least 2 key drivers of testing volume acceleration. The first is related to the adoption of GLP-1 drugs where Waters' Instruments and Columns are specified into in-process testing and QA/QC testing at the 2 leading manufacturers. We expect our position to contribute an average additional revenue growth of 30 basis points per year between now and 2030.\nThe second is PFAS testing where we've been gaining share in a rapidly expanding market, in part driven by the sensitivity and compact size of our Xevo TQ Absolute mass spec. We expect PFAS testing to contribute an additional 30 basis points to our revenue growth for the foreseeable future.\nFinally, Wyatt light scattering is a high-growth business, serving attractive large molecule applications. We expect it to contribute 40 basis points of core growth accretion to our business on an annualized basis. It also accelerates our ability to solve customer challenges in formulation development, bioanalytical characterization and QA/QC testing, which has positive repercussions for our Waters business as we increasingly tie our Columns, LC and mass spec into these workflows.\nI will now cover our 2024 full year guidance. We expect customer spending caution to continue in the first quarter of the year with slow budget releases for downstream implementation. We then expect to see a gradual improvement for the remainder of the year as budgets open up, market conditions improve and as prior year comparisons become easier. We expect weakness in China to continue, particularly in the first half of the year, which also plays into the growth phasing of our guide. With this initial outlook for 2024, we expect full year organic constant currency sales growth to be between negative 0.5% to positive 1.5%. We expect continued strong operational performance to build leveraging our P&L with 20 to 30 basis points of further operating margin expansion while still reinvesting for growth and we expect adjusted EPS growth of 0% to 3% in the range of $11.75 to $12.05.\nNow I will pass the call over to Amol to continue covering our fourth quarter financial results in more detail and give additional commentary on our guidance for 2024. Amol?\n\nAmol Chaubal\n\nSenior VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Udit, and good morning, everyone. We delivered a solid close to a tough year in the fourth quarter with sales that were in line with our expectations despite continued market challenges. In the quarter, sales declined 4.5% as reported, which aligned with our expectations for a 15% increase in reported revenues versus Q3. Organic constant currency sales declined 8% against the high single-digit growth comparison last year. We did observe a budget flush in the fourth quarter as sales grew across all geographies in Q4 and versus Q3. However, this year's budget flush was more muted than typical, consistent with our expectations. Our Wyatt acquisition delivered excellent results again, adding over 3% growth to the reported sales. In organic constant currency by end market, Pharma declined 11%, Industrial declined 4% and Academic & Government declined 9%.\nIn Pharma, our results were impacted by a further weakening in China, which declined 45% for the quarter. Outside of China, Pharma sales declined 4% as instrument sales were impacted by a muted budget flush in line with our expectations.\nIn Industrial, growth was flat outside of China against a tough high teens prior year comparison. China declined approximately 20% and as weakness has broadened into nonpharma segments due to weak economic conditions. Overall, we observed continued strong growth in PFAS and battery-related applications which have continued to partially offset weakness in more cyclical areas.\nIn Economic & Government, our ex-China business continued to perform well with mid-single-digit growth. However, this was more than offset by a decline of almost 40% in China, where demand has deteriorated after the benefits of stimulus ended in the second quarter.\nBy geography, in Asia fell 16% as China weakness more than offset mid-single-digit growth in the rest of Asia. The Americas declined 2% and Europe declined 6%, driven by this year's muted budget flush dynamics. By products and services, Instruments declined 20%. Recurring revenues grew mid-single digits with continued high single-digit growth outside of China. There was 1 additional day in the quarter versus the prior year.\nLooking now at our full year results. By end market, Pharma declined 5%. Industrial was flat and Academic & Government grew 10%. Excluding China, Pharma and Industrial grew low single digits, and A&G grew mid-teens for the year, each reflecting solid results against double-digit comps. Now by geography, sales in Asia declined 7%, with China declining more than 20%, while Asia ex China grew high single digits. The Americas grew 1% and Europe grew 2%. By products and services, Instruments declined 10%, which is primarily driven by China. Excluding China, Instruments declined low single digits in 2023, reflecting healthy high single-digit 4-year CAGR. Recurring revenues grew 6% overall and high single digits outside of China with robust growth throughout the year. Chemistry growth has been supported by strong customer demand for MaxPeak Premier Columns serving large molecule workflows and adoption of e-commerce. For service, growth has been supported by expansion of plan attachment. In 2023, we exceeded our objective for a further 100 basis points of service plan attachment and delivered a 200 basis point increase for the year.\nNow I will comment on our fourth quarter and full year non-GAAP financial performance versus the prior year. Despite headwinds from lower sales volumes, FX and inflation, in 2023, our team responded to these challenges with resilience and commitment. Our continued focus on operational excellence with pricing, productivity and proactive cost alignment together with lower incentive compensation, allowed us to deliver a fourth quarter gross margin of 61.2% and expansion of 170 basis points and fourth quarter adjusted operating margin of 34.9%, an expansion of 120 basis points. For the full year, our focus and efforts resulted in gross margin of 59.6% and an expansion of 160 basis points and an adjusted operating margin of 30.9% and expansion of 70 basis points, which is after reinvesting in our high-growth adjacencies. Our effective operating tax rate for the quarter was 17.1%, 50 basis points below prior year quarter. For the full year, it was 16.2%.\nOur average share count came in at 59.3 million shares, which is about 300,000 less than the fourth quarter of last year. Our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share were $3.62. On a GAAP basis, our earnings per fully diluted share were $3.65. For the full year, our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share were $11.75. Foreign exchange headwinds lowered our non-GAAP EPS growth by 3%, and there was a 1% dilution from the Wyatt acquisition. On a GAAP basis, EPS was $10.84 A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached to this morning's press release and in the appendix of our earnings call presentation.\nNow turning to free cash flow, capital deployment and our balance sheet. We define free cash flows as cash from operation less capital expenditure free cash flow was $192 million after funding $42 million of capital expenditures. For the full year, free cash flow was $554 million after funding $161 million of capital expenditures. Excluded from the free cash flow were payments of $72 million related to tax reform, $26 million for Wyatt assumed liabilities and $16 million related to investment in our Taunton precision chemistry operations. We maintain a strong balance sheet, access to liquidity and well-structured debt maturity profile. This strength allows us to prioritize investing in growth, including M&A and returning capital to shareholders. We continue to evaluate M&A opportunities that will meaningfully accelerate value creation. At the end of the quarter, our net debt position further declined to $2 billion, a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of about 2x. This represents a decrease of approximately $150 million during the quarter as we delivered the Wyatt acquisition. As previously disclosed, our share buyback program has been temporarily suspended to enable us to pay down debt incurred as part of the Wyatt transaction. We will evaluate the resumption of our share repurchase program throughout 2024 and as part of our balanced capital deployment objective.\nNow as we look toward the year ahead, I would like to provide you with our high-level thoughts for 2024. Similar to others in the industry, our growth in 2023 was slower than usual, driven by unprecedented weakness in China and cautious spending from customers in other regions. We view these market conditions as temporary and anticipate a gradual recovery in sales growth throughout 2024. While our customers remain healthy, market uncertainty still remains and necessitates prudence in our guide. These dynamics support full year 2024 organic constant currency sales growth guidance of negative 0.5% to positive 1.5%. At current exchange rates, currency translation is expected to result in a negative impact of just under 1% on full year sales. We expect Wyatt transaction to add approximately 1.3% M&A contribution to our full year 2024 revenues from inorganic sales incurred in the first 4.5 months of the year. Therefore, our total reported sales growth guidance is approximately 0% to 2%. We expect to extend our strong margin performance into 2024 and deliver a gross margin of 59.8% for the full year, which is 20 basis points of expansion versus 2023. We also expect to deliver 20 to 30 basis points of additional operating margin expansion versus 2023, resulting in an adjusted operating margin of slightly over 31%. We expect our full year net interest expense to be approximately $80 million. Our full year tax rate is expected to remain largely consistent with 2023 levels at 16.3%. Our average diluted 2024 share count is expected to be approximately 59.7 million.\nNow rolling all this together, on a non-GAAP basis, our full year 2024 earnings per fully diluted share guidance is projected in the range of $11.75 to $12.05, which is approximately 0% to 3% growth and includes an estimated headwind of approximately 2% due to unfavorable foreign exchange.\nTurning now to our expectations for the first quarter of 2024. We believe that customer budget release timing will be slower than typical in the first quarter. In addition, current levels of market weakness in China are not fully reflected in last year's first quarter comparison. Last year's deterioration picked up significantly in the second quarter and thereafter. The first quarter also last year benefited from A&G stimulus in China. As a result, we expect our China business to decline approximately 40% year-over-year in Q1. Given these dynamics, we expect organic constant currency sales growth in the range of negative 11% to negative 9%. At current rates, currency translation is expected to subtract approximately 1%, while Wyatt is expected to add approximately 3.5% to sales for the quarter. Therefore, our total first quarter reported sales growth guidance is negative 8.5% to negative 6.5%. Based on these revenue expectations, first quarter non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share are estimated to be in the range $2.05 to $2.15 and which includes a negative currency impact of approximately 4 percentage points at current FX rates.\nNow I would like to turn the call back to Udit for some summary comments. Udit?\n\nUdit Batra\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThank you, Amol. So in summary, another transformative year for Waters. We will continue to navigate the current market environment well and deliver earnings growth for our shareholders in 2024. Before I close, I would like to share a few updates on our ESG efforts. We've made strong progress towards our environmental goals with 70% -- 77% of our electricity now sourced from renewable or low carbon sources. In 2023, we started working with the science-based targets initiative to build on this progress and develop further emissions reduction targets. We've also enhanced our climate-related disclosure with our TCFD-related reporting. Waters was recognized as 1 of the best companies to work for by the U.S. News and World Report, and we achieved a perfect score of 100 on the Human Rights Campaign Foundation's Corporate Equality Index. We're also proud that our governance has been recognized. Water's Board of Directors was named the 2024 public company Board of the Year by National Association of Corporate Directors, New England chapter.\nSo with that, I'll turn the call back over to Caspar.\n\nCaspar Tudor\n\nManage of Investor Relation\n\nThanks, Udit. That concludes our formal comments. We are now ready to open the phone lines for questions."

Welcome to the Waters Corporation Third Quarter 2023 Financial Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] This conference call is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, please disconnect at this time. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Mr. Caspar Tudor, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nCaspar Tudor\n\nManage of Investor Relation\n\nThank you, Ivy. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Waters Corporation Third Quarter Earnings Call. Today, I'm joined by Dr. Udit Batra, Waters' President and Chief Executive Officer; and Amol Chaubal, Waters' Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. .\nBefore we begin, I will cover the cautionary language. I would first like to point out that our earnings release and the slide presentation supplementing today's call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website at ir.waters.com. In this conference call, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the company. In particular, we will provide guidance regarding possible future results and commentary on potential market and business conditions that may impact Waters Corporation over the fourth quarter of 2023, full year 2023 and 2024. These statements are only our present expectations and actual events or results may differ materially. For more details, please see the risk factors included in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K, our Form 10-Qs and the cautionary language included in this morning's earnings release.\nDuring today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including in our discussions of the results of operations. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are attached to our earnings release issued this morning and in the appendix of our presentation, which are available on the company's website. Unless stated otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the third quarter of fiscal year 2022 in organic constant currency terms.\nIn addition, unless stated otherwise, all year-over-year revenue growth rates and ranges given on today's call given on comparable organic -- on a comparable organic constant currency basis. Finally, we do not intend to update our guidance predictions or projections, except as part of the regularly scheduled quarterly earnings release or as otherwise required by law. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Udit to deliver our key remarks for the quarter, then Amol will provide a more detailed look at our financial results. After, we will open up the phone lines to take questions. Udit?\n\nUdit Batra\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThank you, Caspar, and good morning, everyone. I want to start today's call by thanking my colleagues for remaining focused on our customers in developing new products and supporting each other. Despite the challenging macro environment, our teams delivered a solid performance and did a great job capitalizing on the available opportunities through strong commercial execution. As headwinds from China and FX became greater, our indomitable teams rallied to drive productivity gains and margin expansion, resulting in strong adjusted earnings growth for the quarter. We launched innovative new products that address the critical unmet needs of our customers and further differentiate our revitalized portfolio in the attractive end markets that we serve. We also continued to make strong progress with Wyatt, including the launch of our first new light scattering instrument.\nTurning now to our results. In the third quarter, sales grew less than 1% as reported. Organic constant currency sales declined by 4%. Sales outside of China were largely at or above our expectations. However, demand in China fell beyond our expectations, which ultimately led to our sales landing at the lower end of our guide. With the U.S. dollar strengthening, the currency impact on sales for the quarter was flat versus our expectations of a 1% tailwind. Viet continued its strong start contributing 4% growth to the quarter as expected. Despite the market challenges and the adverse FX impact, we expanded our gross margin percentage by 240 basis points and adjusted operating margin percentage by 380 basis points. This allowed us to deliver non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share, above our expectations at $2.84, an 8% increase. On a GAAP basis, our earnings per fully diluted share were $2.27.\nLooking now at our organic constant currency results in more detail. In the Pharma segment, U.S. pharma grew 6% and Europe grew 5% with a strong continuing performance among our large to medium-sized customers despite slow funnel velocity. In China, we saw continued weakness in pharma throughout the quarter. Market challenges in China have now broadened beyond pharma and impacted both our industrial and academic and government end market results in the quarter. Overall, sales in China declined approximately 30% as the demand environment further deteriorated as the quarter progressed.\nIn the Industrial segment, China declined low teens. Outside of China, Industrial declined 6% as growth in the quarter was subdued by a tough prior year comparison of over 20%. While the most cyclical applications in industrial have continued to slow globally, we saw continued strong traction in PFAS and battery testing applications. In academic and government, we continued to see strong uptake of new products in Europe with low double-digit growth and in the Americas with mid-single-digit growth. However, this strength was more than offset by pronounced weakening in China, which declined over 30% now that the shipments related to last year's stimulus program have concluded. In our core business, while the market environment has become more difficult, we continue to deliver strong commercial results. When looking at our third quarter results outside of China, our organic constant currency sales grew low single digits year-over-year and is a healthy 7% on a 2- and 4-year [indiscernible] basis.\nOn a year-to-date basis, our organic constant currency growth has been mid-single digits year-over-year, excluding China and flat overall, including China. A key driver of performance for our business this year is mass spec, which is an area where we have gained share with our innovative new product portfolio. We're also managing our P&L very effectively through our focus on operational excellence that drove strong margin performance in the quarter and year-to-date. In the third quarter, our gross margin was 59.1%, a year-over-year expansion of 240 basis points. Our adjusted operating margin was 31.5%, expanding 380 basis points. Year-to-date, our results also showed substantial margin expansion with our gross margin up 160 basis points to 59%, and our adjusted operating margin up 60 basis points to 29.4%.\nLet me talk about about what drove this. First, our commercial teams have continued to achieve strong pricing results at levels that were over 250 basis points for the quarter. Second, we're beginning to realize the productivity benefits of our focus on operational excellence and digitization. I'm excited that next month, Waters' will celebrate the opening of our new global capability center in Bangalore, India, which will further accelerate our pursuit of digitization and operational excellence. Third, through our proactive cost actions, we have rapidly aligned resources to our long-term growth strategy. While the current market environment is challenging, the long-term fundamentals of our end markets continue to be excellent. As I mentioned last quarter, there are incremental growth vectors to our historical 5% instrument growth that result in a great long-term growth profile for our business. This includes global prescription drug sales, which are expected to exceed historical growth rates as well as measures we have put in place to improve pricing where we expect to sustain a more than 100 basis point improvement versus historical levels.\nIn addition, the growing adoption of analytical instruments in process development for large molecule therapeutics is a new growth vector for instruments such as mass spec and light scattering in our portfolio. This is only expected to strengthen as end users find value in these instruments for high volume and recurring applications such as process development, raw materials testing and quality control. The competitive edge of our revitalized portfolio also positions us well for long-term growth. Our product portfolio has been renewed in the last few years with significant innovation that is answering the critical unmet needs of our customers. This includes new launches in LC such as the Alliance IS, which we believe is the most significant innovation to hit pharma QA/QC labs in the past decade.\nIn mass spec, the industry-leading sensitivity of Zevo TQ Absolute has allowed us to gain share in the food and environmental market for PFAS related testing applications. In chemistry, our MAX Peak premier columns have been the most successful launch in our company's history, serving the more complex needs of large molecule separation in our customers' labs. During the quarter, we announced 2 new product launches for bioanalytical characterization including our first new instrument launch with Viant. We launched a new bioprocess walkup solution that combines our Andrew plus liquid handling robot, 1 lab software and our BioAccord LC-MS system into a more automated setup that is even easier to use. Together, these new products help engineers capture high-quality bioprocess and drug product data directly from upstream bioreactors such as those offered by Sartorius. It achieved this via simple workflows that automate sample prep, LC-MS analysis and data capture. This accelerates the upstream development of maps and other biologic drugs providing more optimal clone selection that results in more effective titles and yields.\nSecond, we launched our first new life scattering instrument within the wire portfolio. ZetaStar is designed to measure -- to precisely measure and analyze nanoparticles used in downstream biologics and material science applications. It combines 3 life scattering techniques into a single device cutting measurement time by up to 10x compared to other methods while using extremely low sample volumes. I would now like to cover our updated 2023 guidance.\nGrowth rates in China have continued to deteriorate as the year has progressed. We expect this to decline further in the fourth quarter sequentially. We now expect China to decline approximately 25% for the year versus our prior expectations of low double digits. The result is an incremental headwind to our full year organic constant currency growth of approximately 250 basis points versus our previous guidance. As a result, we now expect our revised full year organic constant currency sales growth to be in the range of negative 2% to negative 1%. Despite the lower revenue guide for continuing to proactively manage our cost structure and drive productivity expansion, resulting in no change to our expected margin percentage performance versus our previous guide. We expect our full year adjusted operating margin to be 30.5%, which is 30 basis points of expansion versus 2022.\nOur updated full year adjusted EPS guidance is resulting in the range of $11.65 to $11.75. Now, I will pass the call over to Amol to continue covering our third quarter financial results in more detail and give additional commentary on our guidance. Amol?\n\nAmol Chaubal\n\nSenior VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Udit, and good morning, everyone. In the third quarter, sales grew less than 1% as reported. Organic constant currency sales declined 4% against a mid-teens growth comparison last year. Waters' Division and TA both declined 4%. We saw good results again from our Wyatt acquisition, which added 4% constant currency growth and performed in line with our expectations despite the challenging environment. The impact of FX was flat in the quarter, which came in below our expectations of a 1% tailwind to as reported sales. .\nIn organic constant currency by end market, pharma declined 2%, industrial declined 8% and academic and government declined 3%. In Pharma, mid-single-digit positive growth outside of China was more than offset by continued slowdown in China Pharma, which declined over 30%. In Industrial, our business declined high single digits with a tough growth comparison of 22% in the prior year quarter and due to China weakness now spilling over into nonpharma segments. We continue to see strong growth in global PFAS testing and battery testing applications.\nAcademic and government declined 3%. Outside of China, overall A&G growth was up 8%. This was led by double-digit growth in Europe and mid-single-digit growth in the Americas. In China, A&G declined over 30% as demand fell rapidly after we completed shipments under the stimulus program in the first half of the year. By geography, sales in Asia declined 12%. The Americas was flat and Europe grew 3%. In Asia, China broadly declined. Excluding China, Asia grew 3%, which was in line with our expectations. India grew low double digits and Japan grew mid-teens. In Americas, Pharma grew 6%, which exceeded our expectations as we executed very well with our large to mid-pharma customers. Academic and government also grew 6%. However, strength in these 2 segments was offset by contraction in industrial for the quarter.\nIn Europe, growth exceeded our expectations in Pharma, which grew mid-single digits and academic and government, which grew 10%, while Industrial declined mid-single digits. By products and segments, instruments declined 13%. Recurring revenues grew mid-single digits overall and high single digits outside of China. There was no change in number of days versus the prior year's quarter. Our continued focus on operational excellence with pricing, productivity and proactive cost lament together with lower incentive compensation drove continued margin expansion. Gross margin for the quarter was approximately 59.1%, an expansion of 240 basis points compared to 56.7% in the third quarter of 2022.\nAdjusted operating margin for the quarter was approximately 31.5%, an expansion of 380 basis points compared to 27.7% in the third quarter of 2022. Our effective operating tax rate for the quarter was 14.7% due to discrete items within the quarter. The average share count came in at 59.3 million shares, which is about 800,000 less than the third quarter of last year. Our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share were $2.84, an increase of 8% despite flat revenue. On a GAAP basis, our earnings per fully diluted share were $2.27. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached to this morning's press release and in the appendix of our earnings call presentation. Turning now to free cash flow, capital deployment and our balance sheet. We define free cash flow as cash from operations, less capital expenditures and excludes special items.\nIn the third quarter of 2023, free cash flow was $123 million after funding $38 million of capital expenditures. Free cash flow was impacted by higher inventory balances. We maintain a strong balance sheet, access to liquidity and a well-structured debt maturity profile. This strength allows us to prioritize investing in growth, including M&A and returning capital to shareholders. We continue to evaluate M&A opportunities that will meaningfully accelerate value creation. At the end of third quarter, our net debt position further declined to $2.2 billion, a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of about 2.2. This represents a decrease of $125 million during the quarter as we delivered the Wyatt acquisition.\nAs previously disclosed, our share buyback program has been temporarily suspended to enable us to pay down the debt incurred as part of the Wyatt acquisition. We will evaluate the resumption of our share repurchase program through the quarter and into the first half of next year. Now I would like to provide our updated thoughts for 2023. As Udit outlined, growth rates in China have continued to deteriorate as the year has progressed. In addition, weakness in China has now broadened beyond pharma and into industrial and academic and government end markets. We expect China growth rates to sequentially decline further in the fourth quarter and now expect China to decline approximately 25% for the full year versus our prior expectations of low double-digit decline. This translates to a full year growth headwind of approximately 250 basis points versus our previous guide. As a result, we are updating our full year 2023 organic constant currency sales growth guidance to the range between negative 2% and negative 1%.\nAt current exchange rates, where the U.S. dollar has strengthened against most major currencies since our last earnings call, currency translation is now expected to have a 1.5% negative impact on our full year sales, which is a 150 basis point headwind versus our prior guide. Consistent with our prior expectations, we expect the Wyatt transaction to add approximately 2.5% to our full year 2023 revenue growth. Therefore, our total reported sales growth guidance is now negative 1% to flat. As Udit covered, despite incremental headwinds from China and FX, our teams have rallied to drive pricing and productivity gains. We expect this will allow us to deliver a gross margin of approximately 59% for the year, which is in line with our previous guidance and is 100 basis points of expansion versus last year. Together with proactive cost alignment, we expect this will allow us to deliver an adjusted operating margin of approximately 30.5% for the year, after funding investments in high-growth adjacencies, which is also in line with our previous guide and is 30 basis points of expansion versus last year.\nWe expect our full year net interest expense to be approximately $80 million. The full year tax rate is expected to remain at approximately 15.5%. Our average diluted 2023 share count is expected to be approximately 59.2 million shares. Now rolling all this together on a non-GAAP basis, our full year 2023 earnings per fully diluted share guidance is projected in the range of $11.65 to $11.75, which includes a negative currency impact of approximately 3.5 percentage points at current FX rates. Looking to the fourth quarter of 2023, we expect further weakness in China and cautious spending from our customers throughout the quarter. Hence, we expect fourth quarter organic constant currency sales growth in the range of negative 8% to negative 5%. At today's rates, currency translation is expected to subtract approximately 1.5%, while we expect Wyatt to add approximately 3.5% to our fourth quarter revenue growth. Therefore, our total fourth quarter reported sales growth guidance is negative 6% to negative 3%.\nFourth quarter non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share are estimated to be in the range of $3.52 to $3.62, which includes a negative impact from currency of approximately 5 percentage points at current FX rates. Now I would like to turn it back to Udit for some summary comments. Udit?\n\nUdit Batra\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThank you, Amol. So to summarize, despite a macro environment that has progressively weakened this year, we have continued to deliver a solid performance through our execution. We are also driving strong outcomes in our margin and earnings performance and are maintaining our full year gross margin and adjusted operating margin guidance despite incremental headwinds from volume and FX. We have strengthened our product portfolio even further through innovation while continuing to make strong progress with our acquisition of Wyatt.\nLater this month, we look forward to issuing our 2023 ESG report which is a transparent way to show our active progress each year on our commitment to leave the world better than we found it. Some key highlights to expect relate to our continued reduction of emissions, increased renewable energy use, increase of female representation in management roles as well as the TCFD-related environmental disclosures we're initiating in this year's report. So with that, I'll turn the call back over to Caspar.\n\nCaspar Tudor\n\nManage of Investor Relation\n\nThanks, Udit. That concludes our formal comments. We are now ready to open the phone lines for questions. ."

After we will open the phone lines up to take questions. Udit?\n\nUdit Batra\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Waters Corporation\n\nThank you, Caspar, and good morning, everyone. We continue to deliver excellent results in the third quarter with very strong growth across our product portfolio, our end markets and geographies. This was led by instrument growth of more than 20%. Similar to previous quarters, orders again outpaced sales.\nA result like this takes an exceptional effort and dedication from all our colleagues, we are very proud of what our teams continue to consistently deliver. Today, we have 3 key messages to share, which reflect the ongoing strength and exciting drivers of our business.\nFirst, we are consistently delivering strong commercial execution. Our transformation has become embedded in how we operate with a relentless focus on commercial excellence. You can see this in our results.\nSecond, innovation at Waters is back. It's delivering across our portfolio and contributing meaningfully to our growth. Our refreshed product portfolio is answering our customers' unmet needs across a variety of applications. Adoption rates for new instruments have been impressive and are driving market share gains.\nThirdly, our growth initiatives are gaining traction. We continue to make measurable progress on our high-growth adjacencies and have proof points that are giving us confidence.\nTurning now to our third quarter results. Our revenue grew 7% as reported, and 15% on a constant currency basis. We saw broad strength across our end markets and geographies with robust demand from our customers.\nGrowth in the quarter was led by industrial and academic and government, which both grew over 20% and pharma, which grew 9%. Each of our regions grew double digits. China grew over 20%. India grew 20%. Europe grew mid-teens, and the U.S. grew 11%.\nInstruments grew over 20% with our LC, mass spec and TA portfolios each growing double digits. Mass spec growth was very strong at almost 40%. Recurring revenues grew 10%, supported by our growth initiatives in e-commerce and service attachment.\nOur Q3 non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share was $2.64. This is roughly flat year-over-year despite FX headwinds of 13%.\nNow looking at our year-to-date performance, we're executing well throughout the organization despite a tough macroeconomic environment. Our strength has been broad-based across our geographies and end markets. Each of which are up double digits this year.\nPharma is up 12%. Industrial is up 15%, and academic and government is up 16%. The instrument growth has been very strong throughout the year, growing 19% year-to-date, led by the U.S. at almost 30%. We expect this to take future growth in our recurring revenues.\nOur transformation has allowed us to consistently deliver excellent results. Our 3-year CAGR underscores the momentum we've built across our business. Year-to-date, we've delivered 9%, 3-year stacked growth overall on a constant currency basis.\nMoving on to our second key message, innovation. Waters has long been known as an innovation leader. Our investments in innovation are again driving results and contributing meaningfully to our growth. Sales of Arc HPLC, ACQUITY Premier and Max Premier Columns again doubled in the quarter versus the previous year.\nOur new products are solving problems that matter to our customers, supported by our technical strength and strong commercial execution. Arc HPLC is driving customers to upgrade their LC fleet used for routine small molecule analysis. This is advancing customer lab capabilities and productivity while accelerating the cadence of instrument replacement.\nOur MaxPeak Premier technology separates complex molecules like biologics. By eliminating the need for passivation, MaxPeak Columns can get scientists answers up to 20x faster than their non-Premier equivalent. They also gave sharper peaks with 12x the sensitivity when separating oligonucleotides as an example.\nThe customer benefits around Premier are very compelling. This has resulted in significant large molecule growth in recent quarters, which now accounts for over 30% of our pharma revenues versus 20% just a few years ago. Today, biologics represents 20% of the pharmaceutical market, but account for 40% of the R&D pipeline, positioning us very well for future growth.\nWith our cyclic ion mobility separation, high-resolution mass spec, Cyclic IMS for short, scientists can separate molecules by shape as well as mass due to the combination of ion mobility with time-of-flight. This is providing customers with amplified resolution and clarity. Demand has ramped up for Cyclic within OMEX research for lipids, proteins and metabolites, all exciting areas within early disease detection and discovery.\nAs an example, the largest privately funded mass [spectrometry] facility in Canada has been using Cyclic for antibody sequencing and discovery. They're impressed with the quality of data that Cyclic has provided supporting their lab at the forefront of scientific discovery.\nAlso within mass spec, we're seeing great traction for our recently launched Xevo TQ Absolute. It has seen strong demand in food and environmental applications, led by Per and perfluorinated compound testing. The PFAS testing market has seen rapid growth in recent months, driven by increased surveillance testing and newly added compounds of interest. We see this as a multiyear growth opportunity.\nIn June of this year, the U.S. EPA announced new drinking water health advisories for the 4 most notorious PFAS compounds setting measurement levels finer than part-per-billion. TQ Absolute is so sensitive, it can detect PFAS at 1 part-per-quadrillion. This is less than a grain of sand in an Olympic-sized Summing pool.\nTQ Absolute's ability to quantitate low abundance molecules is beyond anything on the market and gives us the right to win in this space. Since launching TQ Absolute, we won competitive placements for PFAS testing across every region. In one example, a large global testing organization is using its infant food and water testing in Southeast Asia. This customer is developing a new set of methods that are -- that can be used for routine testing across workflows in their organization.\nWithin informatics, waters_connect is enabling exciting new analytical areas in large molecule analysis. On instruments like the G3 QTof and BioAccord. This includes cell culture media analysis, peptide mapping and oligonucleotide characterization. There is a lot of long-term potential in this area, given demand for stability, quality and impurity analysis.\nThe characterization of biologics and novel modalities allows these molecules to move downstream into routine QA/QC workflows. Additionally, at TA, we have added new powder rheology capabilities to our portfolio. This is to support the strong growth we are seeing in battery-related applications.\nOrders are critical to anode and cathode manufacturing, allowing battery producers to better screen electrode coatings and solvent-free dry coatings helps ensures optimal performance, prevent defects and reduce cell failure rates.\nAccording to industry sources, in the next 10 years, production of lithium-ion batteries is expected to grow tenfold. Demand is expected to exceed 4,000 gigawatt hours per year by 2022, driven by electric vehicles and energy storage. As battery volume scale, our TA instrument portfolio is well positioned to support an expanding set of testing demands within the battery development and safety analysis space.\nOne of our European customers, the fast-growing Scandinavian battery producer, uses our rheometers to test incoming materials for critical electrode components. This company has tripled its purchases of TA instruments this year, reflecting not only its own growth, but the confidence they have in our technology and support as they scale their operations.\nI would now like to share some of the recent progress we've made in our -- towards the high-growth adjacencies as our third key message. Since time is limited, I will only focus on Bioprocess Characterization.\nBioAccord offers a compelling value proposition to bioprocess engineers. It provides a paradigm shift in analytical capabilities for biologics manufacturing, which while being quick and easy to use. Through our collaboration with Sartorius, we've expanded the capabilities of BioAccord in this area. We can dramatically shorten clone selection times.\nWe are also enabling improvements in tighter and yields, which can reduce COGS. Our value proposition is resonating amongst industry leaders. At the recent Bioprocess International Conference in Boston, which I attended per study, AstraZeneca publicly highlighted the benefits of implementing online process analytical technology using the BioAccord monitoring to monitor drug substance and cell culture media.\nMeanwhile, Janssen and other pharmaceutical companies are already using it to monitor vital components during cell culture production and for analysis of raw materials used in bioprocessing. By finger printing components in cell culture media using BioAccord, they are generating insights that can help streamline the manufacturing process. These are just a few of the early proof points we can share with you today for BioAccord. We're encouraged by the long-term opportunity we have to solve unmet needs in Bioprocess Characterization.\nNow I will pass the call over to Amol to continue covering our third quarter financial performance and provide our guidance for the remainder of 2022. Amol?\n\nAmol Chaubal\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Waters Corporation\n\nThank you, Udit, and good morning, everyone. We delivered another excellent quarter in Q3 with 15% constant currency growth. Waters Division grew 14% and TA grew 18%. By end market, pharma grew 9%, industrial grew 22% and academic and government grew 29%.\nIn pharma, we saw growth in both large and small molecule with strength across segments, applications and regions. In industrial, each of our major regions grew mid-teens or above, with China up almost 30%, Europe up over 20% and U.S. growing 16%. Growth was led by LC-MS instrument sales, which grew 50% with our chemical analysis, food and environmental businesses, all delivering strong growth. In academic and government, growth was also strong across all regions.\nNow by geography, sales in Asia grew 18%. The Americas grew 11% and Europe grew 14%. In Asia, growth was led by China, where sales grew 23% as we executed well across all trade classes despite the challenges posed by new lockdowns.\nIn the Americas, the U.S. grew 11% with growth across applications and end markets. Europe grew 14% in the quarter, led by industrial, which grew over 20% and pharma, which grew low double digits. By products and services, instruments grew 21% with our LC-MS and TA portfolios each growing double digits. Recurring revenues grew 10% with chemistry up 10% and service up 9%. There was no change in the number of days versus the prior year's quarter.\nFinally, TA had another great quarter with sales up 18%, led by strong growth in thermal analysis and rheology. Demand for TA products remained strong across all regions with sales in electronics and batteries continuing to ramp. Gross margin for the quarter was 56.7% compared to 58.9% in the third quarter of 2021.\nWe had incredible growth in instrument sales this quarter with mass spec growing nearly 40%. While this resulted in approximately 40 basis points of adverse mix impact for the quarter, it is expected to drive future margin accretive recurring revenue growth. The strong U.S. dollar resulted in 120 basis points of FX headwind on gross margin in the quarter.\nWe have continued to offset the impact of inflation with pricing increases. Working with our customers, our teams delivered over 350 basis points of net pricing gains in the quarter. While inflation had no net impact on our gross profit dollars, it does affect margin calculation as the revenue base is also higher. These dynamics drove the remaining difference in the year-over-year gross margin for the quarter. But again, there was no net impact of inflation on gross profit dollars or earnings per share as the incremental inflationary costs were offset by pricing increases.\nOperating margin for the quarter was approximately 27.8% compared to 29.7% in the third quarter of 2021, driven primarily by foreign exchange headwinds and the gross margin dynamics. Year-to-date, operating margins have expanded 70 basis points before 110 basis points of foreign exchange headwind.\nThe expansion of 70 basis points includes the investments we have been making to nurture our higher growth adjacencies and includes the impact of higher instrument mix and the inflation dynamics I just discussed. Our effective operating tax rate for the quarter was 15.1%. Average share count came in at 60.1 million shares, which is about 1.8 million less than the third quarter of last year.\nOur non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share for the third quarter was $2.64 in comparison to $2.66 last year. The foreign exchange headwind lowered our non-GAAP EPS growth by 13%. On a GAAP basis, our earnings per fully diluted share was $2.60. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached to the press release issued this morning and in the appendix of our earnings call presentation.\nTurning to free cash flow, capital deployment and our balance sheet. We define free cash flow as cash from operations, less capital expenditures and excludes special items. In the third quarter of 2022, free cash flow was $126 million after funding $32 million of capital expenditures.\nSince last quarter, accounts receivables have moved back in line with historical pattern relative to our sales volume. However, we continue to build inventory as a proactive measure to secure supply and build safety stock, given strong instrument demand.\nIn the third quarter, our inventory balance increased by $32 million. We maintain a strong balance sheet, access to liquidity and a well-structured debt maturity profile. This strength allows us the ability to prioritize investing in growth, including M&A and returning capital to shareholders.\nWe continue to evaluate M&A opportunities that will meaningfully accelerate value creation in well-thought-out attractive, high-growth adjacent markets. In Q3, we repurchased approximately 483,000 shares of our common stock for $155 million. At the end of the quarter, our net debt position was approximately $1.1 billion with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of about 1.1.\nNow as we look ahead to the remainder of the year, I would like to provide some updated context on our thoughts for 2022. We have seen continued strong performance this year, driven by robust end market demand, excellent commercial execution across all our geographies and new product introductions, which are driving growth.\nAs we close the year, we expect our sales momentum to remain solid and that our refreshed portfolio and growth initiatives will continue to enhance our performance. We also expect to successfully navigate supply chain constraints and inflationary pressures assuming these challenges do not worsen.\nIn light of this continued strong performance, we are raising our full year 2022 guidance to 11.5% to 12% constant currency sales growth, up from our prior guide of 9.5% to 10.5%. At current rates, a negative currency translation is expected to subtract approximately 6 percentage points resulting in a full year reported sales growth guidance of 5.5% to 6%.\nGross margin for the full year is expected to be nearly 58%, and includes 100 basis points of FX headwinds versus prior year. Operating margin is expected to be 30.2%, which includes 120 basis points of underlying margin expansion, offset by 120 basis points of FX headwind.\nWe expect our full year net interest expense to be approximately $38 million and full year tax rate to be approximately 15.5%. Average diluted 2022 share count is expected to be approximately 60.3 million. Our share repurchase program will continue as we progress through the rest of the year, and we'll provide updates as appropriate.\nRolling all this together and on a non-GAAP basis, full year 2022 earnings per fully diluted share are now projected in the range of $11.85 to $11.95, which is 6% to 7% growth versus last year despite a negative currency impact of approximately 11 percentage points. Versus the previous guide, our updated guidance includes improved underlying business performance of $0.14, offset by $0.24 of higher FX headwind.\nAt current FX rates, we estimate the full year FX impact on 2023 to be a year-over-year headwind of 2% to 3% on sales, and 4% to 5% on adjusted EPS. FX impact is expected to be largely concentrated in the first half of 2023 at current rates.\nLooking to the fourth quarter of 2022, we expect constant currency sales growth to be 6% to 8%. At today's rates, currency translation is expected to subtract approximately 8 percentage points, resulting in a fourth quarter reported sales growth guidance of minus 2% to 0%.\nFourth quarter non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share are estimated to be in the range of $3.66 to $3.76, which is flat to 3% higher than prior year's quarter despite negative currency impact of approximately 15 percentage points.\nNow I would like to turn it to Udit for summary comments. Udit?\n\nUdit Batra\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Waters Corporation\n\nThank you, Amol. In summary, we are very pleased with our performance. Demand has continued to be robust across our resilient end markets and geographies. This, together with our strong commercial execution and refreshed portfolio is allowing us to consistently deliver excellent results. Once again, we are raising our full year sales guidance from a prior range of 9.5% to 10.5%, now to 11.5% to 12%.\nIn closing, I would like to point out that our 2022 ESG report will be released next week. At Waters, we're proud to have been widely recognized as an ESG leader. We believe that we all have a part to play in leaving the world better than we found it from decreasing our environmental footprint to becoming more representative of the society we live in.\nThis year, we made further progress towards our goals, delivering approximately 60% of our electricity from renewable or low-carbon sources. We launched the Water Student Academy and our partnering with 3 historically black colleges and universities to provide STEM education and career opportunities. We also conducted broad stakeholder engagement in our comprehensive materiality assessment.\nWe are proud that our new state-of-the-art chemical manufacturing facility in Taunton, Massachusetts was recognized by the U.S. Green Building Council as the only LEED-certified facility of its kind in the state and among the small number in the United States. While there is always more work to be done in ESG, I'm proud of the progress we've made.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call back over to Caspar.\n\nCaspar Tudor\n\nManage of Investor Relation, Waters Corporation\n\nThanks, Udit. That concludes our formal comments, and we are now ready to open the phone lines for questions."

Welcome to the Waters Corporation Second Quarter 2023 Financial Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] This conference call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Mr. Caspar Tudor, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nCaspar Tudor\n\nManage of Investor Relation\n\nThank you, Ivy. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Waters Corporation Second Quarter Earnings Call. Today, I'm joined by Dr. Udit Batra, Water's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Amol Chaubal, Waters Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nBefore we begin, I will cover the cautionary language. In this conference call, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the company. In particular, we will provide guidance regarding possible future results and commentary on potential market and business conditions that impact Waters Corporation over the third quarter of 2023 and full year 2023.

Finally, we do not intend to update our predictions or projections, except as part of our regularly scheduled quarterly earnings release was otherwise required by law.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Udit to deliver our key remarks for the quarter, then Amol will provide a more detailed look at our financial results after we will open up the phone lines to take questions.\n\nUdit Batra\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThank you, Caspar, and good morning, everyone. Before diving into the results, I would like to start by saying that I'm very proud of how our teams have executed this quarter. We delivered a solid performance across our end markets despite a challenging environment and a stronger-than-expected slowdown in China. Our revitalized portfolio is driving results in areas of high unmet need as our newly launched products continue to gain traction. And we're well positioned for future growth as we make meaningful progress and make further investment in our high-growth adjacencies.\nTurning to our results. In the second quarter, we delivered at the high end of our guidance with 3% organic constant currency growth. We also had a great start to the Wyatt acquisition, which performed ahead of expectations and contributed 2% growth for the quarter. Overall, constant currency growth was 5% and our as-reported growth was 4%. Our organic constant currency performance was led by strong growth in the industrial segment, which grew low double digits and the academic and government segment, which grew over 20%. In both of these end markets, mass spec grew over 40% as our revitalized portfolio saw continued strong demand. In the pharma segment, which declined 4%, both the U.S. and Europe grew high single digits, showing initial signs of recovery in pharma spend. However, this was more than offset by significant worsening in the China pharma market as weakness broadened beyond CDMOs. The weakness in China also impacted our instrument growth, which declined 2% in the quarter. When excluding China, instrument growth was 8%, led by mid-teens instrument growth in the U.S. and low double-digit growth in Europe. Meanwhile, our recurring revenue grew high single digits, driven by increased service plan attachment and chemical e-commerce adoption. Our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share came in above our expectations at $2.80, driven by operational excellence across pricing and procurement as well as our cost actions. On a GAAP basis, our earnings per fully diluted shares were $2.55.\nDespite the challenging macro conditions, our commercial execution remains strong. So far this year within instruments, mass spec has grown high-teens on both a year-over-year and 2-year stack basis as our commercial teams have capitalized on the strength of our renewed product portfolio. Our TA Instruments division has also seen strong results despite macro challenges, having grown low double digits year-over-year and on a 2-year stack basis. Our commercial initiatives and strong execution have enabled high single-digit growth in recurring revenue. We have already achieved our goal of increasing service plan attachment by a further 100 basis points in 2023. We're now targeting an additional 100 basis points of expansion over the remainder of the year. The strength of our execution and the quality of our service offering is helping us drive this growth, and there is further runway ahead. Price is also a key part of our execution where we built commercial muscle and discipline in recent years. We've achieved strong results in price over 200 basis points so far this year. With our operational excellence, we expect to meaningfully expand our margins this year. For the first half of 2023, our gross margin is 58.9%, which is an expansion of 110 basis points versus the first half of 2022. For the full year, we expect to deliver a gross margin of 59%, which is 100 basis points of expansion versus last year. We also expect to deliver an operating margin of 30.5% this year, which is 30 basis points higher than last year.\nOur revitalized portfolio is also driving results in areas of high unmet need. I would like to share a few specific examples. First, in the industrial segment, we're seeing strong growth in PFAS testing, and we are towards the beginning of a multiyear growth opportunity. Our growth in PFAS testing is twice as fast as the 20% estimated market growth rate as we continue to take share with our Xevo TQ Absolute mass spec. In the academic and government segment, our high-res mass spec portfolio is seeing strong adoption at a time where global funding for R&D applications continues to be elevated. Select Series MRT is unique in the high-res mass spec market due to its enhanced resolution at high speeds, which gives it unique capabilities for metabolomics and imaging applications where throughput requirements are high. At ASMS recently, we announced new enhancements for the MRT, which increases imaging resolution by 50% and boost sample throughput even further. Earlier this year, we launched Alliance iS, which we believe is the most significant innovation to hit pharma QA/QC in the past decade. We've continued to see strong interest in its launch and several customers have already made plans to replace their LCs with this new industry-leading platform. We now have not 1 but 2 new industry-leading LCs for QA/QC applications in pharma, Alliance iS and Arc HPLC. Both of these instruments answer significant unmet needs in the market, which continue to drive long-term growth in instrument replacement. And in our TA division, new product launches such as powder reology accessory and the battery cycle microcalimeter have supported growth in battery testing for electric vehicles. Battery testing is a fast-growing market, and we are well positioned to support demand for characterization that will lead to safer and better performing batteries. The strong results we've achieved in growing markets like batteries have allowed us to deliver double-digit growth in TA so far this year despite the challenging environment.\nWe remain well positioned for future growth and the long-term fundamentals of our business have never been better. While instruments are always prone to short-term fluctuations in spending patterns, instrument growth has been highly resilient on a long-term basis with average growth of about 5%. As we look ahead, the demand profile for our instruments has only strengthened versus this historical trend. Total global prescription drug sales, which is a key driver of instrument volume growth are expected to exceed historical growth rates for the foreseeable future. And our potential is further enhanced by the measures we have put in place to improve pricing where we expect to sustain 100 to 200 basis points improvement versus historical levels. In addition, the growing adoption of analytical instruments in process development and process optimization of large molecule therapeutics is a new growth vector for our business. Here, novel modalities require more advanced characterization techniques like mass spec and light scattering that have not been used in the past. We believe that this trend will not only continue, but will also pave the way for adoption of analytical instruments in high-volume, recurring applications and large molecule manufacturing. We expect this to occur as they become embedded within process control, QA/QC and raw material testing over time. We remain focused on nurturing this growth opportunity with our continued investment in bioanalytical characterization and bio separations. In bioanalytical characterization, which is a $1.8 billion total addressable market, a 10% to 12% projected annual growth rate, we've been investing both organically and inorganically. We recently closed the acquisition of Wyatt, which expands our ability to characterize large molecules across various stages of production beyond that of what we can do with LC UV and LC mass spec alone. We also recently announced an expansion in our collaboration with Sartorius from upstream development into downstream manufacturing. So far, in upstream process development, we've demonstrated that bearing biocard Arc line with the Sartorius Ambr 15 and 250 bioreactors, has enabled bioprocess engineers to accelerate clone selection results from weeks to a matter of hours. Now our expanded collaboration will integrate our technologies further. We will develop analytical solutions that are in line and offer real-time monitoring of process controls and critical quality attributes in the bioreactor. By offering bioprocess engineers access to comprehensive analytical data for downstream batch and continuous manufacturing, we can support improved yields while reducing waste and lowering biomanufacturing costs. Finally, in bio separations, which is a $1.4 billion total addressable market with an 8% to 10% projected annual growth rate, we recently announced a multiyear research collaboration with Princeton University. The goal of this partnership is to advance research and drug discovery and development using novel bioseparation techniques that we're developing for large complex biomolecules.\nWe also just introduced our first release in the new line of size exclusion chromatography columns, which are designed for the separation and analysis of viral vectors in applications such as gene therapy. Our new X bridge Premier GTB SEC columns reduced the cost of gene therapies by using 3 to 10x less sample than other methods while generating faster results and providing more drug substance information. They can measure aggregation, titer and low molecular weight impurities at twice the speed of existing column at 50% greater resolution. The combination of these columns with wired multi-angle light scattering will deepen the level of information that can be acquired from a single experiment. This will accelerate development times of modalities such as adeno-associated viruses or AAV and allow for more optimized manufacturing, which can reduce costs.\nTurning now to our updated 2023 guidance. The slowdown in the pharma end market in China has progressed beyond CDMOs resulting in broader weakness. As a result, we now expect China to decline low double digits this year versus our prior expectation of low digit -- low single-digit growth. This translates to a full year growth headwind of approximately 200 basis points versus our previous guide. Our guide does not assume any benefit from a new round of stimulus in the second half of the year. While our funnel remains healthy, we also continue to see slower than usual funnel velocity from customers more broadly. Assuming that this trend continues through the rest of the year, we expect this to translate to a full year growth headwind of approximately 100 basis points versus our previous guide. As a result, we now expect our revised full year organic constant currency growth to be in the range of 0.5% to 1.5%.\nDespite our lower revenue guide, we are proactively managing our cost and productivity while continuing to preserve our investments in future growth. In July, we made some very difficult but necessary decisions to realign the workforce in our core business, which impacted just under 5% of our employees. These actions allow us to better align our resources with our growth strategy and offset the incremental demand weakness that I just described. This, together with our focus on operational excellence across pricing and procurement is expected to deliver a gross margin of 59% this year, an increase of 100 basis points versus 2022. We also expect to expand our operating margin approximate to approximately 30.5%, which is an increase of 30 basis points versus 2022. These actions allow us to mitigate EPS headwind from lower expected revenue, resulting in our updated full year EPS guidance of $12.20 to $12.30.\nNow I will pass the call to Amol to continue covering our second quarter financial results and give additional commentary on our guidance. Amol?\n\nAmol Chaubal\n\nSenior VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Udit, and good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, sales grew 4% as reported. Organic constant currency sales grew 3% as Waters division grew 2% and TA grew 11%. We had a great start to the Wyatt acquisition, which exceeded our expectations and added 2% constant currency sales growth. FX was a 1% headwind in the quarter.\nIn organic constant currency by end market, Pharma declined 4%, industrial grew 11% and academic and government grew over 20%. In pharma, high single-digit growth in the U.S. and Europe, was more than offset by a pronounced slowdown in China pharma, which declined over 40%.\nIn industrial, Waters Division and TA both grew low double digits with broad strength across all regions. In our Water business, strength was led by food and environmental testing where we saw continued strong growth in global PFAS testing applications driven by our Xevo TQ Absolute mass spectrometer. In TA growth was led by thermal analysis and microcalorometry. We again saw strong demand in secular growth drivers such as batteries and electronics testing which more than offset weakness in more cyclical revenues from materials and chemicals. In academic and government, there was continued strong demand in upstream applications from our refreshed mass spec portfolio supported by elevated funding levels across the globe. Mass spec sales more than doubled in the U.S., grew approximately 50% in Europe and grew 30% in Asia. By product, strength was led by our high-res mass spec portfolio with applications in metabolomics and spatial biology, resulting in strong growth for cyclic IMS and Select Series MRT.\nNow by geography, sales in Asia declined 5%, the Americas grew 7% and Europe grew 9%. In Asia, China declined [indiscernible] Excluding China, Asia grew 6%, with India growing high single digits and Japan growing mid-single digits. In the Americas, pharma grew 6%, led by 7% growth in the U.S., industrial grew 3% and academic and government grew almost 30%. In Europe, pharma grew 7%, industrial grew 6% and academic and government grew over 35%. In both Americas and Europe, these results reflect 2-year stacked growth of high single digits or above across each of the end markets. By products and services, instrument declined 2% overall as mass spec growth of almost 20% and double-digit growth in TA Instrument Systems was more than offset by China pharma demand weakness led by LC. Recurring revenues grew high single digits. Chemistry growth was supported by continued strength in MaxPeak premier columns, which grew over 50% in the quarter. Service growth continues to be supported by strong pull-through from recent instrument sales and increasing service plan attachment, which has already increased by another 100 basis points in the first half of the year. There was no change in the number of days versus the prior year quarter.\nGross margin for the quarter was approximately 59.3%, an expansion of 230 basis points compared to 57% in the second quarter of 2022. Operating margin for the quarter was approximately 29.6%, an expansion of 120 basis points compared to 28.4% in the second quarter of 2022. Our margin expansion was driven by strong operational performance with pricing gains, lower material and freight costs as well as prudent management of spend. Our effective operating tax rate for the quarter was 17.2%. Average share count came in at 59 million shares, which is about 1.5 million less than the second quarter of last year.\nOn non-GAAP -- our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share was $2.80. On a GAAP basis, our earnings per fully diluted share was $2.55. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached to the press release issued this morning and in the appendix of our earnings call presentation.\nTurning to free cash flow, capital deployment and our balance sheet. We define free cash flow as cash from operations, less capital expenditures and excludes special items. In the second quarter of 2023, free cash flow was $73 million after funding $47 million of capital expenditures. Free cash flow is impacted by higher inventory balances, timing of income tax payments and wire transaction expenses. We maintain a strong balance sheet, access to liquidity and a well-structured debt maturity profile. This strength allows us the ability to prioritize investing in growth, including M&A and returning capital to shareholders. We continue to evaluate M&A opportunities that will meaningfully accelerate value creation in well thought-out, attractive adjacent markets.\nAt the end of the quarter, our net debt position was approximately $2.3 billion, which is a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of about 2.3. This represents an increase of $1.3 billion during the quarter, which is related primarily to the Wyatt acquisition. As we previously disclosed, we have temporarily suspended our share buyback program for the remainder of the year to use our free cash flow to delever the acquisition.\nNow I would like to provide our updated thoughts for 2023. As Udit outlined, the slowdown in China pharma has progressed beyond CDMOs, resulting in broader weakness. As a result, we now expect China to decline low double digits this year versus our prior expectation of low single-digit growth. This translates to a full year growth headwind of approximately 200 basis points versus our previous guide. Additionally, while our funnel remains strong, we are observing longer capital purchasing approval cycles amongst our customers broadly due to spending caution in the current environment. We expect these dynamics to continue through the rest of the year and contribute an additional 100 basis points full year growth headwind versus our previous guide. As a result, we are updating our full year 2023 organic constant currency sales growth guide to 0.5% to 1.5%, which translates to a 2-year stack growth of approximately 6% to 6.5%. At current rates, currency translation is expected to have a minimal impact on the full year sales. Consistent with our prior expectations, we expect wire transaction to add approximately 2.5% to our full year 2023 revenue growth. Therefore, our total reported sales growth guidance is now 3% to 4%. We expect gross margin to be approximately 59% for the year, which is 100 basis points expansion versus last year and is higher than our previous guide. We expect margin to be approximately 30.5%, which translates to 30 basis points of margin expansion versus last year.\nCost actions in our core business are expected to deliver approximately $45 million in annualized savings and are expected to contribute $20 million in 2023, predominantly in the fourth quarter. We will progressively redeploy part of these savings to resource our growth strategy and to expand capacity on high-growth end market opportunities. We expect our full year net interest expense to be approximately $80 million. The full year tax rate is expected to remain at approximately 15.5%. Our average diluted 2023 share count is expected to be approximately 59 million, given the temporary suspension of our share repurchase program. Rolling all this together, on a non-GAAP basis, our full year 2023 earnings per fully diluted share guidance is projected in the range of $12.20 to $12.30, which includes a negative currency impact of approximately 1 percentage point at the current FX rates.\nLooking to the third quarter of 2023, we expect the current market dynamics to persist in China. We also expect cautious spending from our customers throughout the quarter. Hence, we expect third quarter organic constant currency sales growth of negative 4% to negative 2%, which translates to 2-year stacked growth of approximately 5.5% at midpoint, given the mid-teens comp from last year. At today's rates, currency translation is expected to add approximately 1%, and we expect to Wyatt to add approximately 4% to our third quarter revenue growth. Therefore, our total third quarter reported sales growth guidance is 1% to 3%. Third quarter non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share are estimated to be in the range of $2.50 to $2.60 with a neutral currency impact. Now I would like to turn it back to Udit for some summary comments. Udit?\n\nUdit Batra\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThank you, Amol. Even through challenging times in the macroeconomic environment, we continue to come together as an organization to ensure we leave this world better than we found it. With our vibrant employee circles, we recently celebrated Pride Month as well as our Fantastic Women in Engineering. We also kicked off our third year of Water Student Academy, a summer program for high school students from underserved communities who are interested in exploring a career in science. We're also very proud recognized as 1 of U.S. News and World Report Best Companies to Work For. So with that, I'll turn the call back over to Caspar.\n\nCaspar Tudor\n\nManage of Investor Relation\n\nThanks, Udit. That concludes our formal comments, and we are now ready to open the phone line to questions."

Welcome to the Waters Corporation Second Quarter 2022 Financial Results Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) This conference call is being recorded.(Operator Instructions)\nIt is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Mr. Caspar Tudor, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nCaspar Tudor\n\nManage of Investor Relation, Waters Corporation\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Waters Corporation Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call.\nBefore we begin, I will cover the cautionary language. During the course of this conference call, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the company. In particular, we will provide guidance regarding possible future results of the company and commentary on potential market and business conditions that may impact Waters Corporation over the third quarter of 2022 and full year 2022. We caution you that any and all such statements are only our present expectations and that actual events or results may differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements.\nFor a detailed discussion of some of the risks and contingencies that could cause our actual performance to differ significantly from our present expectations, see the risk factors included in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year-ended December 31, 2021, in Part 1 under the caption Risk Factors and in our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter-ended April 2, 2022, in Part 1a under the caption Risk Factors, both of which are on file with the SEC as well as the cautionary language included in this morning's press release.\nWe further caution you that the company does not intend to update any of its predictions or projections except during our regularly scheduled quarterly earnings release conference calls and webcasts or as otherwise required by law.\nDuring today's call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are attached to our earnings release issued this morning and in the appendix of our presentation which are available on the company's website.\nIn our discussions of the results of operations, we may refer to non-GAAP results which exclude the impact of items such as those outlined in our schedule titled Reconciliation of GAAP to Adjusted Non-GAAP Financials included in this morning's press release and in the appendix of our presentation.\nUnless stated otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the second quarter of fiscal year 2021. In addition, unless stated otherwise, all year-over-year revenue growth rates, including revenue growth ranges given on today's call, are given on a comparable constant currency basis.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Dr. Udit Batra, Water's President and CEO. Udit.\n\nUdit Batra\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Waters Corporation\n\nThank you, Caspar, and good morning, everyone. Along with Caspar, joining me on this morning's call is Amol Chaubal, Waters' Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nThe second quarter, we continued to deliver excellent results led by instrument growth of 12%, with continued broad-based strength across our end markets and geographies.\nI would like to take a moment to again acknowledge the unwavering efforts of our teams who have persistently worked through the challenging environment to deliver for our customers. We saw this with our China team, whose dedication and agility through the lockdowns in Shanghai drove exceptional results again this quarter which came ahead of our expectations. But importantly, we've seen this commitment across all our teams and regions and it truly reflects the indomitable spirit we have here at Waters.\nTurning now to Slide 3. We have 3 messages. Our strong commercial momentum is driving great results in end markets that remain healthy. This is reflected in the broad, sustained growth we are delivering across our products, geographies and end markets. Customer demand remains robust with orders that -- again outpacing sales as our strong momentum continued with double-digit sales growth again in the second quarter.\nInnovation is contributing meaningfully to our growth. Our refreshed product portfolio is highly competitive and providing key benefits to our customers which is, again, driving strong adoption of these new products as well as market share gains. Over time, we expect that the strong instrument placements and resulting expansion in our installed base will drive growth in recurring revenue tied to these instruments.\nAnd thirdly, we have a robust business model serving an attractive and resilient base. Waters serves end markets with sustainable growth drivers that are linked to key demographic areas, such as (inaudible) count population growth and increasing regulatory requirements around testing.\nWith our strong business model, we have growth levers that exist throughout the market cycle across instruments, service, chemistry and informatics. Growth in one of these areas usually results in follow-through performance across our business model, and you can see this today with our strong pull-through of instrument sales into higher attachment rates, which is again driving recurring revenue growth.\nNow moving on to Slide 4. In the second quarter, our revenue grew 5% as reported and 10% on a constant currency basis with broad strength across our end markets and geographies as well as in both instruments and recurring revenues. Orders in the quarter exceeded sales of USD 714 million as we continued to see very strong demand from our customers.\nOur Q2 non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share was $2.75, up 6% year-over-year despite FX headwinds. The impact of FX headwind lowered our non-GAAP earnings per share growth by 11% versus the prior quarter. Amol will cover the impact of FX in more detail later in the call.\nNow looking more closely at our top line results for the quarter on Slide 5 in constant currency. First, by operating segment, Waters division grew 10%, while TA grew 12%. By end market, our largest market category, pharma, grew 10%; industrial grew 8%; and academic and government grew 16%.\nIn pharma, we saw continued broad-based strength across segments, geographies and applications with, growth in large molecule and small molecule applications. Growth was led by the U.S., which grew mid-teens with large molecule applications growing twice the rate of small molecule applications; China, which grew in mid-teens; and India, which grew 12%.\nIn industrial, growth was driven by the U.S., up mid-teens; Europe, up high single digits; and India, which grew over 50%.\nOur food and environmental business is performing well with PFAS testing also positively impacting growth.\nIn academic and government, after seeing a slower recovery than our other end markets last year, customer spending continued to be more active during the quarter with mid-teens growth for the quarter, led by strength in China, India and the Americas.\nNow by geography, sales in Asia grew 9%, the Americas grew 15% and Europe grew 7%. In Asia, growth was led by China, where sales grew 9% despite the presence of COVID-related lockdowns for much of the quarter. Customer demand in China remained strong and we're observing great activity levels which rapidly picked up in June relative to April and May when the lockdowns were in effect. Meanwhile, sales in India grew 24%. The Americas was again our fastest-growing region, with the U.S. growing 14%, which was led by strong instrument sales, which grew 20% along with recurring revenues, which grew 11%. In Europe, the growth was led by pharma and industrial, which both grew high single digits.\nBy products and services, instruments grew 12%, with our LC mass spec and TA portfolios each growing double digits. Recurring revenues grew 8% with chemistry up 9%, and service up 8%.\nNew products again contributed meaningfully to growth in the quarter with unit sales of Arc HPLC and ACQUITY Premier more than doubling versus the second quarter of last year. Unit sales of MaxPeak Premier Columns also more than doubled and have continued to add strength and incremental growth to our chemistry business, driven by large molecule applications.\nIn mass spec, we saw strength across our portfolio, including for our Xevo TQ-XS and Cyclic IMS instruments as well as strong traction for our newly launched Xevo TQ Absolute, which sold out at launch and has already developed a backlog. Customers are seeing the value that TQ Absolute provides in application areas such as food safety and pharma development in small and large molecules -- small molecule applications given its dramatic leap in performance and efficiency compared with other instruments in its class.\nHere in New England, one state public health laboratory was the first to purchase and installed a TQ Absolute for the express purpose of PFAS testing in water and environmental samples. That customer told us that TQ Absolute is giving them a 100 to 400-fold increase in sensitivity versus their prior instrument while being far easier to use in terms of sample prep and in quickly giving them highly accurate results.\nMeanwhile, at the high end, we're seeing good demand for our Cyclic ion mobility technology. One example is researchers at MD Anderson Cancer Center at the University of Texas who are using it for precision molecular profiling within OMEX research. We're getting feedback that it is enabling significant progress in discovering and validating novel blood and plasma biomarkers for early disease detection in oncology.\nFinally, TA had another great quarter with sales up 12%, led by strong growth in thermal analysis, microcalorimetry and rheology. Demand for TA products continues to be strong across all regions, led by electronics and batteries.\nNow moving to Slide 6. I would like to reflect on the excellent strength and momentum we have sustained in the first half of the year driven by our commercial execution, product innovation and pricing offsetting inflation, leading to these great results.\nSo far this year, instruments have grown almost 20%, with recurring revenue up just under 10% against strong stacked comps last year. In the U.S., instruments have grown over 35% year-to-date. All our regions have seen growth, led by Americas, which has grown 20 years -- 20% year-to-date. Meanwhile, China has grown low teens despite the COVID-related lockdowns, which we were able to successfully navigate through in both the first and second quarters of 2022.\nEach of our end markets have seen double-digit growth, which speaks to our broad execution across regions and segments. Meanwhile, we continue to observe strong demand from our customers and are seeing ongoing positive impacts from our market plus growth initiatives.\nNow turning to Slide 7. By each of these initiatives continue to progress, the 3 areas I would like to highlight this quarter are service attachment, e-commerce adoption and launch excellence.\nFirst, with service attachment, we're seeing strong pull-through of our instrument sales into service plan coverage which has driven our attachment rates over 100 basis points higher so far this year which is ahead of our expectations and builds on excellent results last year. The progress we're making with service underscores the opportunity ahead to grow our recurring revenues which layers on top of our instrument growth.\nSecond, also part of our recurring revenues, e-commerce adoption of chemistry has continued to move higher which is having a positive effect on sales by making it easier for our customers to do business with us and driving incremental growth opportunities. 31% of our chemistry is now sold through digital channels, which is a 10-point increase compared to 2019 when the initiative began, and we see further runway to over 50% in the long term. Since we started the initiative in 2019, revenue from digital sales has more than doubled. And in the first half of this year, it grew over 30% versus the first half of 2021.\nThird, our revitalized portfolio is contributing to growth as demand has scaled up for Arc HPLC, for ACQUITY Premier and MaxPeak Premier Columns. Our product vitality index has grown 300 basis points versus the second quarter of last year to 15% as sales of these products have quickly ramped, with launch excellence and the impact of innovation driving strong market uptake.\nAs I've shared before, ACQUITY Premier and MaxPeak Premier were specifically designed to solve challenges that are particularly relevant for large molecules. This technology is capturing growth opportunities as pharma customers seek to expand their capacity and build capabilities for biologics and novel modalities, such as oligonucleotides, mRNA and peptides. Meanwhile, small molecule growth remains solid with customers continuing to refresh and expand their capital equipment with Arc HPLC.\nNow on Slide 8. In June, at ASMS, we announced our new Xevo G3 high-resolution mass spec. The G3 is our latest generation benchtop Q-TOF and it provides increased sensitivity and range for large molecule analysis over its predecessor, the G2, which is one of our best-selling high-res mass spec products. This instrument is described by our customers as an analytical workhorse given that it offers the power and range needed to characterize complex biotherapeutics while also providing the reliability, robustness and reproducibility needed in late-stage development. As biologics and novel modalities increasingly move into later stages, this instrument supports the associated workflows by allowing more detailed characterization of these molecules in product and process development. This occurs before they move downstream into higher volume manufacturing QA/QC where routine analysis will then be performed on instruments such as BioAccord.\nA further key piece of innovation is the software we've developed on waters_connect which allows the compliant workflows developed on the G3 to seamlessly transition to BioAccord with just a few mouse clicks. This ease of transfer had been unheard of before now and it allows our customers to transfer data between instruments and global locations within their enterprise network, all while remaining in an industry compliance setting.\nOn waters_connect, our latest apps are enabling exciting new analytical areas for the G3 and BioAccord, including cell culture media analysis and peptide analysis with in-depth protein and glycan profiling. Most recently, we've added the ability to characterize oligonucleotides and conduct impurity analysis as well as perform lipid nanoparticle compositional analysis and stability testing which is highly relevant for mRNA molecules. These are all new analytical areas in large molecule characterization where there is a lot of long-term potential as the market looks for more advanced characterization capabilities for biologics and novel modalities. As we continue to innovate and expand our offering, we are increasingly well positioned to support biologics and novel modalities as they move downstream into routine analysis.\nNow I'd like to pass the call over to Amol to continue covering our second quarter financial performance and provide our guidance for the remainder of 2022. Amol?\n\nAmol Chaubal\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Waters Corporation\n\nThank you, Udit, and good morning, everyone. Udit already covered the breakdown of our sales growth for the quarter, so I will now cover the remaining elements of our non-GAAP financial performance versus the prior year.\nGross margin for the quarter was 57% compared to 58.9% in the second quarter of 2021, driven primarily by foreign exchange headwinds from the strong U.S. dollar as well as higher instrument mix.\nPricing for the quarter was over 300 basis points, successfully offsetting the impact of material and freight inflation. Operating margin for the quarter was 28.4% compared to 29.2% in the second quarter of 2021. This represents 70 basis points of margin expansion in constant currency before 150 basis points of foreign exchange headwind. For the first half of the year, operating margins have expanded 120 basis points before 80 basis points of foreign exchange headwind. Our effective operating tax rate for the quarter was 14.1%. Average share count came in at 60.5 million shares, which is about 1.6 million less than the second quarter of last year.\nOur non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share for the second quarter increased 6% to $2.75 in comparison to $2.60 last year. The foreign exchange headwind lowered our EPS growth by 11%. On a GAAP basis, our earnings per fully diluted share was $2.72 compared to $2.69 last year.\nA reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached to the press release issued this morning and in the appendix of our earnings call presentation.\nTurning to free cash flow, capital deployment and our balance sheet. We define free cash flow as cash from operations, less capital expenditures, and excludes special items. In the second quarter of 2022, free cash flow was $67 million after funding $39 million of capital expenditures. Excluded from free cash flow was $11 million related to the investment in our Taunton precision chemistry operations and a $38 million tax reform payment.\nOur free cash flow in the quarter was impacted by our proactive measures to secure supply and rebuild safety stock, resulting in a $40 million increase in inventory before exchange rates.\nAdditionally, timing of shipments and installations, particularly in China, resulted in an 8-day increase of DSO to 81 days and an increase in accounts receivable of approximately $60 million before FX. We expect these dynamics to correct in the second half of the year as we have already observed an increase in collections in July. For the full year, we anticipate being close to our historical free cash flow conversion levels.\nWe maintain a strong balance sheet, access to liquidity and a well-structured debt maturity profile. This strength allows us the ability to prioritize investing in growth, including M&A and returning capital to shareholders. We continue to evaluate M&A opportunities that will meaningfully accelerate value creation in well-thought-out, attractive, high-growth, adjacent markets.\nIn Q2, we repurchased approximately 479,000 shares of our common stock for $152 million.\nAt the end of the quarter, our net debt position was approximately $1.1 billion with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of about 1.1.\nNow as we look ahead for the remainder of the year, I would like to provide some updated context on our thoughts for 2022 which is on Slide 10. We've seen continued strong performance this year, driven by robust end market demand and strong commercial execution across all our geographies. As we look ahead, we expect our solid momentum to continue and that our near-term growth initiatives and innovation will provide a lasting contribution to our performance. We also expect to continue to successfully address supply chain constraints and inflationary pressures, assuming these challenges do not worsen over the remainder of the year.\nThese dynamics support increasing the full year 2022 guidance to 9.5% to 10.5% constant currency sales growth, up from our prior guide of 7.5% to 9%. At current rates, a negative currency translation is expected to subtract approximately 5 percentage points, resulting in full year reported sales growth guidance of 4.5% to 5.5%.\nGross margin for the full year is expected to be about 58% and operating margin is expected to be approximately 30.5% as our resilient business momentum is able to mitigate the impact from exchange rates.\nWe expect our full year net interest expense to be approximately $35 million and full year tax rate to be approximately 15.5%.\nAverage diluted 2022 share count is expected to be approximately 60.4 million. Our share repurchase program will continue into the year and we'll provide quarterly updates as appropriate.\nNow rolling all this together and on a non-GAAP basis, full year 2022 earnings per fully diluted share are now projected in the range of $11.95 to $12.05, which includes a negative currency impact of approximately 9 percentage points. Currency impact is $0.56 incrementally more worse than our previous guide. However, our stronger-than-expected results for Q2 and our increased full year growth outlook are expected to offset the currency headwind.\nLooking to the third quarter of 2022, we expect constant currency sales growth to be 8% to 10%. At today's rates, currency translation is expected to subtract approximately 6 percentage points, resulting in third quarter reported sales growth guidance of 2% to 4%.\nThird quarter non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share are estimated to be in the range of $2.50 to $2.60. This includes a negative currency impact of approximately 10 percentage points.\nNow I would like to turn it back to Udit for some summary comments. Udit?\n\nUdit Batra\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Waters Corporation\n\nThank you, Amol. So in summary, we are pleased with our sustained broad strength for the quarter which was driven by our strong commercial execution and the impact of innovation in our highly competitive refreshed product portfolio. Demand has remained strong across our end markets as we've continued to capture growth opportunities in both large and small molecule applications, food and environmental testing and battery material analysis, which each have long-term durable growth opportunities that we're well positioned for. To reflect our strength, we're raising our full year constant currency sales growth from -- sales growth guidance from 7.5% to 9% to 9.5% to 10.5%.\nMeanwhile, we have delivered great operating results despite the challenging macroeconomic environment. And for EPS, our strong results for Q2 and our increased full year growth outlook are expected to offset the impact of foreign exchange headwinds.\nWith that, we will now begin the Q&A session.

Welcome to the Waters Corporation Second Quarter 2024 Financial Results Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session begins. This call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Mr. Caspar Tudor, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nCaspar Tudor\n\nManage of Investor Relation\n\nThank you, Brad. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Waters Corporation Second Quarter Earnings Call. Today, I'm joined by Dr. Udit Batra, Water's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Amol Chaubal, Water's Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I will cover the cautionary language. In this conference call, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the company. We will provide guidance regarding possible future results as well as commentary on potential market and business conditions that may impact Waters Corporation over the third quarter of 2024 and full year 2024.\nThese statements are only our present expectations and actual events or results may differ materially. Please see the risk factors included within our Form 10-K, our Form 10-Qs and the cautionary language included in this morning's earnings release. During today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are attached to our earnings release and in the appendix of the slide presentation accompanying today's call.\nBoth are available on the Investor Relations section of our website. Unless stated otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the second quarter of fiscal year 2023. In addition, unless stated otherwise, all year-over-year revenue growth rates and ranges given on today's call are on a comparable organic constant currency basis.\nFinally, we do not intend to update our guidance predictions or projections, except as part of a regularly scheduled earnings release or as otherwise required by law. Now I'll hand over to Udit to deliver our key remarks. Following that, Amol will present a more detailed view of our results and guidance after we'll open up the phone lines for questions. Over to you, Udit.\n\nUdit Batra\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThank you, Caspar, and good morning, everyone. We achieved strong results in the second quarter that exceeded both our top line and bottom line reported guidance. I want to begin today's call by thanking my colleagues for their dedication to commercial execution, operational management and innovation. This enables us to deliver differentiated performance and accelerate the benefits of pioneering science. In the quarter, year-over-year organic constant currency sales were 500 basis points better than Q1 levels. We saw a steady improvement in customer spending throughout the quarter with a strong finish in June. Orders outpaced sales for the quarter as we built good momentum for the second half of the year. We again delivered resilient operational results with earnings surpassing our expectations. This reflects the strength of our downstream business model, progress on our strategic and operational initiatives and our indomitable spirit. We also continued our steady stream of new product launches, releasing further innovations that address key customer needs.\nWaters now has a highly competitive portfolio serving attractive end markets. We expect this benefit -- we expect this to benefit us as the market recovers and the instrument replacement cycle picks up pace. As we continue to build the Waters of the future, I would like to welcome Rob Carpio, who has joined us as the new Head of the Waters Division. Rob is a talented leader and a seasoned operator with a record of delivering strong financial results and transformation in life sciences. With his appointment, he will comment a long-term growth strategy. Turning now to our results. In the second quarter, sales declined 4% as reported and 4% in organic constant currency.\nOur non-GAAP earnings per share was $2.63. On a GAAP basis, EPS was $2.40. Excluding China, sales declined in low single digits. Growth was consistent with our expectations across each of our end markets. Customer CapEx spending is showing early signs of improvement. In China, sales declined in the low teens, which was better than expected. Growth rates improved in all end markets compared to the previous quarter, especially in pharma and in industrial. While the stimulus measures announced by the Chinese government this year are still in the early stages of implementation. We are having active conversations with customers who stand to benefit from these initiatives.\nSo far, this has led to improved quoting and funnel trends in the region. These opportunities are expected to begin converting to orders in 2025. Overall, instruments declined 17% and recurring revenue grew 5% -- delivered a 2% M&A contribution to sales, which was better than expected. It marks a strong close to the first year following the acquisition, where synergies were delivered well ahead of schedule. Why it operates in high-growth markets serving large molecule applications, especially across cell, gene and RNA therapies. Altogether, it should deliver 40 basis points of annualized accretion to the total company growth in the near to midterm.\nNow I will talk about our operational performance. Margins remained resilient as we again successfully counteracted volume, FX and inflationary headwinds with solid operational management. Our gross margin for the quarter was flat at 59.3%, and our adjusted operating margin was solid at 29.2%. Even with recent progress, our work is far from over. We have runway towards further long-term margin expansion driven by our strategic and operational initiatives. This includes areas such as productivity enhancement where we have various programs that are still in the early stages.\nAt the same time, our focus on pricing continues to yield contribution that is well ahead of historical levels. Looking forward, we feel very good about our future margin opportunity given our recent success in preserving and expanding our margins during challenging business conditions. Beyond 2024 levels, we expect to deliver a more pronounced impact on our long-term margin performance, particularly when more typical volume leverage returns. In the second quarter, we launched a steady stream of new products, solving the unmet needs of our customers. At ASMS in June, we unveiled the Xevo MRD, which is now our highest performing bench top mass spectrometer.\nIt builds on the multi reflecting time-of-flight technology pioneered by the Select Series MRT, which has greater throughput and a more compact form factor. With up to 6x greater resolution and 2x better mass accuracy than competitive systems, the Xevo MRT sets new industry standards for high resolution at blazingly fast speeds. So far, our customers have been impressed by its capabilities. It will serve discovery and other upstream pharma workflows where it will accelerate R&D times for new drugs.\nThis includes areas such as metabolite identification where resolution, accuracy and speed are all critical value drivers. We also launched the latest evolution of our acuity QDa mass detector, 1 of our all-time best-selling analytical instruments. The QDa 2 provides a 20% enhancement in mass range which benefits routine identification and analysis of large molecules. It also has excellent green credentials consuming up to 70% less energy than competing products. This is a benefit of increased importance to our customers.\nMost importantly, the QDA 2 runs on Empower, which allows for seamless regulatory submission of compliance-related data for large molecules. As we look ahead, Waters is well positioned in attractive markets with secular growth drivers where testing volume plays a pivotal role in driving long-term growth. Our full ecosystem of instruments, informatics, advanced chemistry and leading service positions us very well to help ensure the safety of medicine, food and water and batteries in electric vehicles. Along with our business model, the regulated and recurring nature of these applications results in excellent profitability and free cash flow generation.\nIn recent years, we've made meaningful progress in aligning Waters with faster-growing large molecule applications. Now over 1/3 of our pharma revenues comes from large molecules and novel modalities. At the same time, future testing volume is expected to grow faster than historical levels with increased prescription volumes, including GLP-1s and areas such as PFAS testing. With our revitalized portfolio, we are in an excellent position to capitalize on these growth opportunities. Over the past several years, we've launched multiple innovative new products that have enhanced our competitive edge and created better pricing levers.\nServing our core -- our next-generation LC platform, Alliance IS serves routine QAQC analysis for both large and small molecule workflows where innovation helps drive -- helps to drive instrument replacement. It also includes our Xevo TQ absolute mass spectrometer, which is seeing rapid growth in areas such as PFAS testing. Within our high-growth adjacencies, we've launched new products into bioanalytical characterization, battery testing and clinical applications, all of which are gaining traction given the critical unmet needs that they solve. Finally, recent deferral of routine instrument replacement has created a catch-up opportunities -- catch-up opportunity that lies ahead of us. Weak macroeconomic conditions have put temporary constraints on customer CapEx spending for downstream instrumentation.\nHistorically, this dynamic has lasted for 4 to 7 quarters and has been followed by a catch up. Looking at the facts, while no 2 macro environments are the same, Q2 marks the seventh consecutive quarter of LC instrument decline. Expected instrument growth for 2024 equates to a 1% CAGR versus 2019 levels. This is significantly below the 5% long-term average growth rate. Improving funnel trends are a positive leading indicator that we are approaching the early innings of a recovery and initiation of a new replacement cycle.\nI will now cover our 2024 full year guidance. While customer activity is showing signs of recovery, we're adding caution to our guide. Accordingly, we are revising our full year 2024 sales guidance to assume a more gradual pace of improvement in the second half of the year. As a result, our revised full year organic growth constant currency sales guidance is negative 2% to negative 0.5%. With our commitment to excellent operational performance, we expect to build leverage in our P&L and deliver an adjusted operating margin of around 31%. Therefore, our updated adjusted EPS guidance is in the range of $11.55 to $11.65. Now I will pass the call over to Amol to continue covering our financial results in more detail and to provide further guidance -- further details on our guidance. Amol?\n\nAmol Chaubal\n\nSenior VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Udit, and good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, sales exceeded our guidance range on a reported basis, declining 4%. Organic constant currency sales also declined 4%, which was a 5% improvement in growth compared with Q1 levels. We saw a steady improvement in customer spending throughout the quarter with orders outpacing sales. M&A contributed 2% to sales covering -- results in the first 1.5 months of the quarter. This was better than expected as we were able to accelerate revenue synergies as part of our integration. We are pleased that within the first year of the acquisition -- it is already EPS and margin accretive and our M&A execution remains well on track.\nOverall, FX was a 2% headwind to the second quarter sales. In organic constant currency terms, by end market, pharma declined 4%, Industrial declined 4% and academic and government declined 16%. In Pharma, sales excluding China declined low single digits, while in China, sales declined low double digits. In both cases, this reflects an improvement in growth rates compared to the previous quarter. In Industrial, sales declined 1% outside of China, led by low single-digit growth in the Americas. We again saw strong growth globally for PFAS-related applications, which has been a consistent tailwind for environmental testing.\nIn China, sales declined low double digits, which was also an improvement in growth rates compared to the previous quarter. For our TA division, sales were flat, driven by improvement in segments such as electronics, advanced materials and chemicals. In academic and government, growth remained weak as stimulus in China and elevated global funding drove lumpy spending patterns and a tough 21% comparison in the prior year's quarter. By geography, sales in Asia declined 3%, while sales in Americas and Europe both declined 7%.\nBy products and services, instruments declined 17% and chemistry and service both grew 5%. There was no change in the number of days versus the prior year quarter. Our commercial initiatives continue to support robust recurring revenue growth despite ongoing headwinds from China. Within our service business, we have already achieved our goal of increasing service plan attachment by a further 100 basis points this year with service planned revenue growing high single digits in the quarter.\nWe are now targeting an additional 50 to 100 basis points of service plan attachment over the remainder of the year. Now I will comment on our second quarter non-GAAP financial performance versus the prior year. Despite headwinds from lower sales volume, FX and inflation. Our team continued to respond to these challenges with resilience and commitment. Our focus on operational excellence with pricing, productivity and prudent spend management allowed us to deliver a resilient margin performance in the quarter. Gross margin was flat at 59.3% and our second quarter adjusted operating margin was 29.2% as expected.\nExcluding FX, both gross margin and adjusted operating margin expanded 40 basis points year-over-year. Our effective operating tax rate for the quarter was 16.5%, and our average share count was 59.5 million shares. Our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share was $2.63. On a GAAP basis, earnings per fully diluted share was $2.40. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached in this morning's press release and in the appendix of our earnings call presentation. Turning now to free cash flow, capital deployment and our balance sheet. We define free cash flow as cash from operations, less capital expenditures and excludes special items.\nIn the second quarter of 2024, free cash flow was $143 million after funding $36 million of capital expenditures. On a year-to-date basis, free cash flow is $377 million or 28% of sales resulting in free cash flow to adjusted net income conversion ratio of 131%. We maintain a strong balance sheet, access to liquidity and a well-structured debt maturity profile. This strength allows us to prioritize investing in growth. We continue to evaluate M&A opportunities that will enhance value creation for our shareholders.\nIn the second quarter, we continued to delever while paying out this year's tax reform payment of $96 million and other items totaling $30 million. As expected, at the end of the quarter, our net debt position was approximately $1.7 billion which is a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of about 1.7x. As we continue to delever our balance sheet, we will evaluate the resumption of our share repurchase program throughout the remainder of the year.\nNow I would like to share further commentary on our full year outlook and provide you with our guidance for the third quarter. While business conditions showed signs of recovery in the second quarter, we are adding caution to our guidance. As a result, we are revising our full year 2024 sales guidance to assume a more gradual pace of improvement in the second half of the year. Our updated guidance assumes relatively flat quarter-over-quarter revenue progression in Q3 versus Q2. It also implies a weaker than typical budget flush dynamics in the fourth quarter.\nDespite the added caution, we are still expecting the business to return to growth in the second half of the year. Given these dynamics, our revised full year 2024 guidance, is for organic constant currency sales growth between negative 2% and negative 0.5%. At current exchange rates, we anticipate that currency translation will negatively impact full year sales by approximately 1.5%. Meanwhile, M&A contribution from wire transaction has added 1.3% to our full year from inorganic sales incurred in the first 4.5 months of the year.\nTherefore, our total full year 2024 reported sales growth guidance is in the range of negative 2.2% to negative 0.7%. With our commitment to excellent operational performance, we expect to build leverage in our P&L, even with the reduction in our guide. Consistent with our previous guidance, gross margin for the full year is expected to be approximately 59.8%, which is 20 basis points of expansion versus 2023. Our adjusted operating margin is expected to be around 31%. Below the line, we expect full year net interest expense to be approximately $77 million.\nOur full year tax rate is expected to be 16.3% and our average diluted 2024 share count is expected to be approximately 59.4 million. Rolling all this together, on a non-GAAP basis, our full year revised 2024 earnings per fully diluted share guidance is projected in the range of $11.55 to $11.65 and includes an estimated headwind of approximately 3% due to unfavorable foreign exchange. Looking to the third quarter of 2024, we anticipate that customer spending will remain cautious, but show further signs of recovery.\nWe expect an improvement in year-over-year growth compared to that in the second quarter as previous year comparisons, particularly in China, become easier and has continued improvement in funnel activity translates to orders. Given these dynamics, our third quarter organic constant currency sales growth guidance is projected in the range of positive 1% to positive 3%. At current rates, currency translation is expected to subtract approximately 1.5%. Therefore, our third quarter reported sales growth guidance is negative 0.5% to positive 1.5%.\nBased on these revenue expectations, third quarter non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share are estimated to be in the range of $2.60 to $2.70, which includes a negative currency impact of approximately 2 percentage points at current FX rates. Now I would like to turn the call back to Udit for our closing comments. Udit?\n\nUdit Batra\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThank you, Amol. So now to summarize, with our strong commercial execution and continued resilient operational performance, our second quarter results demonstrate Waters' ability to deliver solid results in various market conditions. We're positioned well for the future with a long-term outlook that is above our historical growth rate of 6% as global testing volume growth remains on track and customer CapEx spending continues to recover. I am also proud of what our team has continued to accomplish on ESG and sustainability. Last month, we announced that Waters has become the first liquid chromatography column provider to receive the ACT Ecolabel certification from My Green Lab. This designation applies to more than 40 of our LC columns and makes it easier for scientists and procurement professionals to choose more sustainable lab products. So with that, I will now turn the call back over to Caspar.\n\nCaspar Tudor\n\nManage of Investor Relation\n\nThanks, Udit. And that concludes our formal comments. We are now ready to open the phone lines for questions."

Welcome to the Waters Corporation First Quarter 2024 Financial Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded. If anyone has objections, please disconnect at this time. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Mr. Caspar Tudor, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nCaspar Tudor\n\nManage of Investor Relation\n\nThank you, Ivy. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Waters Corporation First Quarter Earnings Call. Today, I'm joined by Dr. Udit Batra, Waters' President and Chief Executive Officer; and Amol Chaubal, Waters' Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I will cover the cautionary language. I would like to first point out that our earnings release and the slide presentation supplementing today's call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website. In this conference call, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the company.\nIn particular, we will provide guidance regarding possible future results and commentary on potential market and business conditions that may impact Waters Corporation over the second quarter of 2024 and full year 2024. These statements are only our present expectations and actual events or results may differ materially. For more details, please see the risk factors included in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K, our Form 10-Qs and the cautionary language included in this morning's earnings release. During today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including in our discussions of the results of operations.\nReconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are attached to our earnings release issued this morning and in the appendix of our presentation, which are available on the company's website. Unless stated otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 in organic constant currency terms. In addition, unless stated otherwise, all year-over-year revenue growth rates and ranges given on today's call, are given on a comparable organic constant currency basis. Finally, we do not intend to update our guidance, predictions or projections, except as part of a regularly scheduled quarterly earnings release or as otherwise required by law. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Udit to deliver our key remarks, then Amol will provide a more detailed look at our financial results. After, we will open the phone lines to take questions. Udit?\n\nUdit Batra\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThank you, Caspar, and good morning, everyone. We had a strong start to the year with sales coming in at the high end of our expectations backed again by excellent operational performance. I want to begin today's call by thanking my colleagues for their continued focus on innovation and supporting our customers. These results reflect our drive to accelerate the benefits of pioneering science with our innovative portfolio. In the first quarter, market conditions were as expected, with cautious customer spending and later than typical budget releases. But as budgets opened up, we executed well with sales landing at the high end of our guide. We also continued to deliver outstanding operational results. Earnings were above our guidance and margins expanded even with volume and FX headwinds. This is a testament to our team, our resilient business model and our operational initiatives. Waters is well positioned for future growth in our attractive secular end markets. In the first quarter, we added to our revitalized portfolio with new products that serve high-growth areas.\nTurning now to our results. In the first quarter, sales landed at the high end of our guidance, declining 7% as reported and 9% in organic constant currency. Our non-GAAP earnings per share exceeded our guidance at $2.21. On a GAAP basis, EPS was $1.72. Outside of China, sales declined mid-single digits as expected. In China, sales declined just under 30%, which was better than expected. Growth remained weak as our prior year baseline does not reflect last year's deterioration in market conditions, which became more pronounced in the second half.\nWhile instruments declined 25% overall, LC sales were slightly better than expected, instrument weakness was led by mass spec, particularly for A&G-related applications, which had a tough prior year comparison from global funding and the China stimulus -- delivered a 3% M&A contribution to sales. We continue to see strong synergy performance and traction for our recently launched products such as Zatar. Now I will talk more about our operational performance. We believe the best reflection of good operational execution is effective margin management, particularly when things slow down.\nwhile facing significant headwinds from volume, FX and inflation, we delivered yet another strong margin result. Our gross margin expanded 40 basis points to 58.9%, and our operating margin expanded 20 basis points for the quarter to 27%. This was achieved through a combination of our operational management initiatives across pricing, productivity and proactive cost alignment. These initiatives position us well for resilience during lower volume periods and give longer-term opportunity when market conditions normalize. You can see further evidence of our operational performance and our free cash flow. We had an exceptional start to the year, generating free cash flow of USD 234 million in the first quarter, which was 37% of sales.\nWith our excellent free cash flow profile, we made rapid progress in delevering from the Viet acquisition, as we approach its 1-year anniversary. We serve attractive secular end markets where testing volume plays a pivotal role in our business. This volume, which is correlated with global prescription consumption is expected to accelerate in the future, supporting our strong long-term growth outlook. Our distinct advantage in downstream applications lines with our full ecosystem of products that complement our innovative instrument portfolio.\nIn addition, we have strategically aligned with high-growth opportunities that further enhance our core position. We had a busy quarter launching several new products that support a number of exciting, high-growth areas. At Analytica, last month, we launched the Alliance IS Bio, a version of our groundbreaking next-generation liquid chromatography platform suited for biologics applications. In the -- the new HPLC system combines advanced bioseparation technology, bioinert surfaces and built-in intelligence features. This helps Biopharma QC analysts boost efficiency and eliminate up to 40% -- lab errors. We believe that the Alliance is the most significant innovation to hit pharma QA/QC labs in over a decade.\nWe're excited to bring this technology to routine testing applications for biologics. Supporting BioSeparations, we launched a new set of size exclusion chromatography columns called GPX Resolve Premier. These columns enable scientists to quickly assess aggregate content, integrity and purity of larger biologic particles. It covers modalities such as lipid nanoparticles -- acids, and viral vectors and give scientists a significant improvement in sensitivity and sample consumption while accelerating run times. This launch supports the development of these modalities into downstream high-volume settings, where Waters has critical instrument technology like LC, mass spec and light scattering as well as highly innovative industry-leading software chemistry and service.\nTo simplify the detection of PFAS, we launched Waters, oasis, dual-phase analysis cartridges. This consumable streamline sample prep for PFAS workflows when detecting concentrations in water, soils, biosolids and issues. It joins our comprehensive portfolio of solutions that support the surging demand for PFAS testing, which is a USD 300 million to USD 350 million global market, growing 20% annually. In an environment of increased scrutiny, the ability to accurately test for PFAS at very low levels is becoming a critical compliance need for a broad spectrum of industries.\nOur Xevo TQ absolute mass spec has leading sensitivity for detecting these anionic compounds. It can detect BFAST levels at as low as 1 part per quadrillion. Last month, in the United States, the EPA finalized and enforceable 4 parts per trillion limit of PFOA and PFOS in drinking water, which marks a significant regulatory milestone. Later this year, further regulations governing PFAS are expected across the globe. This includes the European Union, where each proposed chemicals, regulation contemplates a PFAS ban on products manufactured as well as once imported.\nIn our TA business, we launched the RIO IS, which serves battery testing applications when used with our Hybrid Rheometers. This -- spectroscopy accessory supports characterization of electrode studies, which can lead to more efficient factory reduction. I will now cover our 2024 full year guidance. With our first quarter results, we remain on track to achieve our full year revenue outlook, which is unchanged from our previous guidance at negative 0.5% to positive 1.5% growth in organic constant currency.\nWe expect growth rates to improve over the remainder of the year and as our prior year comparisons, especially in China get easier. We expect improving funnel activity to translate to orders as the year progresses. With our strong operational performance, we expect to build leverage and P&L despite the flattish revenue guide and delivered 20 to 30 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion while still reinvesting for growth. As a result, our adjusted EPS guidance is also unchanged at 0% to 3% growth in the range of $11.75 to $12.05. Now I will pass the call over to Amol to continue covering our financial results in more detail and provide the rest of our guidance. Amol?\n\nAmol Chaubal\n\nSenior VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Udit, and good morning, everyone. In the first quarter, sales landed at the high end of our guidance range, declining 7% -- and 9% in organic constant currency. As Udit mentioned, end market dynamics were consistent with our expectations. Ex-China declined mid-single digits as expected, while China declined close to 30%, which was slightly better than expected. In organic constant currency by end market, Pharma declined 6%, industrial declined 7% and academic and government declined 30%.\nIn Pharma, sales outside of China declined low single digits as we executed well in this CapEx constrained environment. In China, sales declined almost 30% due to ongoing market challenges that are not reflected in our prior year baselines. In industrial, food and environmental applications grew mid-single digits with continued strong growth in -- globally. We also saw strong growth in battery testing within our TA business, which has been a consistent growth theme.\nHowever, this strength was more than offset by weakness in core industrial applications, which are more cyclical. Our TA business declined high single digits overall, while chemical analysis declined high teens. In academic and government, growth was weak against a 45% comparison as stimulus in China and elevated global funding in the prior year quarter drove lumpy spending patterns. By geography, sales in Asia declined 16%. The Americas declined 8% and Europe declined 3%. By products and services, instruments declined 25% with LC growth slightly better than expected.\nWithin recurring revenues, chemistry grew low single digits and service grew mid-single digits, both of which were affected by low activity levels in China. The quarter had 1 fewer day versus first quarter of 2023, which translates to a growth headwind of approximately 1% for recurring revenues. Now I will comment on our first quarter non-GAAP financial performance versus the prior year. Despite headwinds from lower sales volumes, FX and inflation, our team continued to respond to these challenges with resilience and commitment.\nOur focus on operational excellence with pricing, productivity and proactive cost alignment allowed us to deliver first quarter gross margin of 58.9%, an expansion of 40 basis points and first quarter adjusted operating margin of 27% and expansion of 20 basis points. Our effective operating tax rate for the quarter was 14.3% and our average share count was 59.4 million shares. Our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share were $2.21. On a GAAP basis, earnings per fully diluted share were $1.72. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached to this morning's press release and in the appendix of our earnings call presentation. Turning now to free cash flow, capital deployment and our balance sheet. We define free cash flow as cash from operations, less capital expenditures and excludes special items.\nIn the first quarter of 2024, free cash flow was $234 million after funding $29 million of capital expenditures, which is approximately 37% of sales. We maintain a strong balance sheet, access to liquidity and well-structured debt maturity profile. This strength allows us to prioritize investing in growth, including M&A and returning capital to shareholders. We continue to evaluate M&A opportunities that will meaningfully accelerate value creation. At the end of the quarter, our net debt position further declined to $1.7 billion, which is a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of about 1.8x.\nThis reflects a decrease of approximately $300 million, as we delivered the wire acquisition. As previously disclosed, our share buyback program has been temporarily suspended to enable us to pay down debt in -- part of the wires acquisition last year. We will evaluate the resumption of our share repurchase program throughout 2024 as part of our balanced capital deployment objectives. Now I would like to share further commentary on our full year outlook and provide you with our second quarter guidance. We expect to see an improvement in sales growth over the course of 2024 as prior year comparisons, particularly in China, become easier, and has improved funnel activity translates to orders.\nOur full year guidance is unchanged with 2024 organic constant currency sales growth expected between negative 0.5% and positive 1.5%. At current exchange rates, currency translation is expected to result in a negative impact of just under 1% on a full year sales basis. We expect wire transaction to add just over 1% M&A contribution to our full year 2024 revenue for inorganic sales incurred in the first 4.5 months of the year. Therefore, our total reported sales growth guidance is unchanged at approximately 0% to 2%.\nDespite guiding to flattish sales, we expect to deliver a gross margin of 59.8% for the full year, which is a 20 basis points of expansion versus 2023. We also expect to deliver 20 to 30 basis points of operating margin expansion versus 2023, resulting in an adjusted operating margin of slightly over 31%. We expect our full year net interest expense to be approximately $80 million. Our full year tax rate is expected to be 16.3%, and our average diluted 2024 share count is expected to be approximately [ 59.7 ] million.\nRolling all this together, on a non-GAAP basis, our full year 2024 earnings per fully diluted share guidance is also unchanged and projected in the range of $11.75 to $12.05. This is approximately 0% to 3% growth and includes an estimated headwind of approximately 2% due to unfavorable foreign exchange. Looking to the second quarter 2024, we anticipate that cautious customer spending will persist. In addition, while the China Q2 baseline reflects the onset of weakness, it does not fully reflect the weakness we observed in the second half of the year.\nAs a result, we expect China to decline mid-teens in Q2 versus 28% decline we saw in Q1. Given these dynamics, we expect to see an improvement in year-over-year growth versus the first quarter and our second quarter organic constant currency sales growth guidance is projected in the range of negative 6% to negative 4%. At current rates, currency translation is expected to subtract approximately 2%. Wires is expected to add approximately 1.5% M&A contribution for sales incurred in the first 1.5 month of the quarter. Therefore, our total second quarter reported sales growth guidance is negative 6.5% to negative 4.5%.\nBased on these revenue expectations, second quarter non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share are estimated to be in the range of $2.50 to $2.60, which includes a negative currency impact of approximately 4 percentage points at current FX rates. Now I would like to turn the call back to Udit for some summary comments. Udit?\n\nUdit Batra\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThank you, Amol. I would like now to give you a brief update on our progress towards leaving the world better than we found it, which is how we think about ESG. We work alongside wonderful people here at Waters, and I'm always proud when others recognize their talent and hard work. Our colleagues were recognized in the quarter for their achievements and contributions to separation science, excellence in manufacturing and for being champions of LGBTQ and women's benefits in the workplace.\nI would also like to congratulate Dr. Philip Wyatt, the founder of Wyatt Technology for receiving the esteemed Pittcon Heritage Award earlier this year. Dr. Wyatt's groundbreaking contributions to laser light scattering technology have paved the way for industry-leading advancements. From a corporate standpoint, Waters has once again been honored by Barron's, earning a place on its list of the 100 most sustainable companies in 2024. Additionally, we are delighted to announce that S&P Global has included Waters in its 2024 sustainability yearbook.\nSeparately, our commitment to robust governance practices was recently highlighted by the New England Chapter of the National Association of Corporate Directors. We were honored to have Massachusetts Governor, Maura Healey present Waters with the 2024 public company Board of the Year Award. After recently committing to SBTI, which is the science-based targets initiative, we are now building on the excellent progress we made in reducing our greenhouse gas emissions. We're in the process of setting new standards towards a long-term reduction in emissions and aligning our business with the 1.5 degree centigrade future.\nNow to summarize, we're pleased with how the first quarter landed versus our expectations, which supports our full year guidance. We remain on track to achieving the 2024 objectives and look forward to building on this strength as the year progresses. Our long-term growth profile remains excellent, and we are aligned to secular tailwinds that are stronger than ever in our attractive markets. With our robust financial profile and balanced capital allocation strategy, we have an excellent platform to deliver sustained value for our shareholders. So with that, I'll turn the call back over to Casper.\n\nCaspar Tudor\n\nManage of Investor Relation\n\nThanks, Udit. That concludes our formal comments. We are now ready to open the phone lines for questions."

(Operator Instructions) The conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions) Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Mr. Caspar Tudor, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nCaspar Tudor\n\nManager of IR, Waters Corporation\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Waters Corporation First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Before we begin, I will cover the cautionary language. During the course of this conference call, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the company. In particular, we will provide guidance regarding possible future results of the company and commentary on potential market and business conditions that may impact Waters Corporation over the second quarter of 2022 and full year 2022. We caution you that any and all such statements are only our present expectations and that actual events or results may differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements.\nFor a detailed discussion of some of the risks and contingencies that could cause our actual performance to differ significantly from our present expectations, see the risk factors included in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, in Part 1 under the caption Risk Factors, and the cautionary language included in this morning's press release, including with respect to risks related to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business. We further caution you that the company does not intend to update any of its predictions or projections, except during our regularly scheduled quarterly earnings release conference calls and webcasts or as otherwise required by law.\nDuring today's call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are attached to our earnings release issued this morning and in the appendix of our presentation, which are available on the company's website. In our discussions of the results of operations, we may refer to non-GAAP results, which exclude the impact of items such as those outlined in our schedule titled reconciliation of GAAP to adjusted non-GAAP financials included in this morning's press release and in the appendix of our presentation. Unless stated otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the first quarter of fiscal year 2021.\nIn addition, unless stated otherwise, all year-over-year revenue growth rates, including revenue growth ranges given on today's call, are given on a comparable constant currency basis.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Dr. Udit Batra, Water's President and CEO. Udit?\n\nUdit Batra\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Waters Corporation\n\nThank you, Caspar, and good morning, everyone. Along with Caspar, joining me on this morning's call is Amol Chaubal, Water's Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We had a record start to the year with first quarter sales led by instruments, which grew over 25% with a broad-based strong performance across all our end markets and geographies.\nBefore summarizing the quarter, let me start by saying how extremely proud I am of our teams who've worked tirelessly to manage our supply chain, delivering operational excellence and exceptional support for our customers through the ongoing challenges of the pandemic. It is a result of the indomitable spirit of all my colleagues at Waters. I will now provide a brief overview of our first quarter operating results and deliver our key messages. Amol will then review our financial results in detail and provide comments on our financial outlook. We will then open up the phone lines to take your questions.\nTurning now to Slide 3. We have 3 key messages. First, we had a very good start to 2022 with great traction for our new instrument products, strong operational performance and sustained commercial momentum. Demand has remained robust across all our end markets. Second, we're laser focused on execution, innovation and growth. We continue to make great progress in executing against our enterprise priorities with our core initiatives positively impacting our results. We have a revitalized portfolio with innovation that is answering the needs of our customers in both large and small molecule workflows as well as our non -- as well as in our nonpharma markets such as food testing, environmental and material science. And thirdly, Waters has a firm commitment to leave the world better than we found it. We are delivering sustainable value to our shareholders and stakeholders through our ESG programs.\nNow moving to Slide 4. In the first quarter, our revenue grew 13% as reported and 16% on a constant currency basis, reflecting broad growth across all our end markets and geographies. Orders in the quarter exceeded our sales of $691 million, reflecting a very strong demand. Instruments grew at 26% in constant currency, with strong growth across our LC mass spec and TA portfolios. New products contributed meaningfully to growth in the quarter, with unit sales of Arc, HPLC and Acuity Premier more than tripling versus the first quarter of last year. In mass spec new instruments in our high-end tandem quad portfolio, such as our Xevo TQ-XS also saw strong growth in both industrial and pharmaceutical applications.\nInstrument strength is a positive indicator for future growth of our consumables and service revenues. Recurring revenues grew 9% for the quarter with chemistry up 8% and service up 9%. This quarter had one fewer day than the first quarter of 2021, which translates to a headwind of approximately 1% for our recurring revenues. Without that, recurring revenues would have also grown double digits.\nOur MAX peak premier columns have continued to strength and incremental growth to our chemistry business, given the benefit this technology provides for novel modality applications and our increased exposure to biologics. Meanwhile, we're seeing increased service plan attachment rates in our key regions at instrument point of sale. By geography, growth was led by the Americas, with the U.S. up 28%, driven by broad performance in each of our end markets. In China, sales grew 17% with pharma, industrial and academic and government, all up double digits.\nAs lockdowns in certain regions persist, we're beginning to see more of an impact to our business, but we're in close contact with our customers and demand remains robust. Once the lockdowns ease, we expect activity levels to catch up that normalize with limited impact to our full year growth expectations for China. However, we anticipate some sales impact in the second quarter if customer access continues to be constrained.\nOur Q1 non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share was $2.80, up 22% year-over-year, driven by sales growth, volume leverage and an ability to manage inflation through pricing. Given the global nature of our business, we're seeing ongoing supply constraints and inflationary pressures. Despite this, we have been successful in working through these challenges, leveraging our global manufacturing footprint and working closely with our customers and suppliers while delivering good operating results.\nTurning now to Slide 5. While each of our initiatives continues to progress. The 2 areas I would like to highlight this quarter are contract organizations and launch excellence. For contract organizations, our unique technical abilities and ability to collaborate closely with our customers are resulting in market share gains and strong revenue growth. Revenues from these customers were up over 25% for this quarter lead by over 50% growth in China.\nTurning now to launch excellence. Our revitalized portfolio is contributing to growth with demand, ramping for Arc HPLC, ACQUITY Premier, and MAX premier columns. ACQUITY Premier and MAX Premier were specifically designed to solve challenges that are particularly relevant for large, complex molecules. Our customers are using the technology for oligonucleotide analysis as well as separation and purification of novel modalities such as mRNA, peptides and glycans, just to name a few examples. Meanwhile, small molecule growth remains solid with customers continuing to purchase new capital equipment, including Arc HPLC.\nNow on Slide 6. We recently launched the Xevo TQ Absolute, which is up to 15x more sensitive when analyzing negatively Ionized compounds compared to other tandem quads currently on the market, while also using less sample. It is designed to help pharmaceutical, food and environmental labs, meet regulations requiring trace-level quantitative mass spec analysis for a broad set of applications.\nIn food testing, the instrument takes detection of anionic pesticides and their metabolites to a new level of quantitation. In pharma, it can provide highly sensitive analysis for oligonucleotides and peptide bioanalysis as well as quantification of estrogens in clinical research, uses for which high-resolution mass spec have typically been required. The instrument is highly efficient, using approximately 50% less electricity and gas and also producing 50% less heat than other high-performance standard quads in the market, both of which reduce the carbon footprint of analytical labs.\nIt is also 50% smaller than other instruments in its class, which also adds value to our customers as space and analytical labs is limited and costly. Our tandem quad portfolio was stronger than ever and together with Waters Connect, we're able to make customers' workflows easier, faster and more efficient without compromising performance.\nNow on Slide 7. Immerse Delaware, our second innovation and Research Lab will be opening tomorrow part of a multiyear collaboration with the University of Delaware. Its purpose is to develop analytical solutions to better characterize the manufacturing process for biologicals and novel modalities, which will support our path into bioprocess characterization. Researchers from both Waters and the University of Delaware will develop solutions, including sensor and instrument improvements, data analytics and process control. This partnership will help us expand our capabilities to drive improvements in quality, yield and efficiency as well as characterize critical quality attributes that will be a key step towards separating the process from the product and biologics.\nOn Slide 8, we are delivering sustainable value to our shareholders and stakeholders through our ESG activities, which continue to be recognized in a number of areas. Earlier this year, we achieved a score of 100 on the 2022 Corporate Equality Index earning Waters in designation as one of the best basis to work for LGBTQ+ equality. In addition, Barron's ranked Waters #6 on its 100 most sustainable U.S. companies list for 2022 based on a set of 230 performance indicators and reflects our efforts of continuous improvement in social and environmental responsibility. On the list, we were the highest placed company in the health care sector and in the Life Science tools segment.\nRecently, within our diversity and inclusion and STEM education efforts, Waters has partnered with 3 historically black colleges and universities to create STEM opportunities for students through funding, instrument donations, mentoring and the awarding of scholarships to students exploring the analytical sciences. In summary, we are pleased with our strong start to the year and the results in revenue growth and operational performance, which are demonstrating our continued success in our focus areas of execution, innovation and growth.\nWith that, I'd like to pass the call over to Amol for a deeper review of the first quarter financials as well as our outlook for the remainder of the year. Amol?\n\nAmol Chaubal\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Waters Corporation\n\nThank you, Udit, and good morning, everyone. As Udit outlined, we recorded net sales of $691 million in the first quarter, an increase of 16% in constant currency and an increase of 13% as reported. Looking more closely at our top line results for the quarter on Slide 9, in constant currency, first by operating segment. Waters Division grew 16%, while TA grew by 18%. By end market, our largest market category, pharma, grew 19%. Industrial grew 17% and academic and government grew 4%.\nIn Pharma, we saw broad-based strength across segments, geographies and applications and in both large molecule and small molecule. Growth was led by the U.S., which was up over 35%. India, up just under 30%; and China, which grew mid-teens. In Industrial, our performance was also strong across all major geographies, with U.S., Europe and China all growing 20% or above.\nTurning to academic and government. We saw a similar trend to last quarter with mid-single-digit growth as customer spending has become more active, led by China and the U.S. Now by geography, sales in Asia were up 14%, with China up 17%. The Americas grew 26% with the U.S. up 28%. And Europe grew 9%. In China, we saw broad performance across all our end markets, which grew each up double digits. In the U.S., growth towards broad-based led by Pharma, which was up almost 40%; and industrial, which grew over 20%.\nGrowth was very strong in both instrument sales, which grew almost 60% and recurring revenues, which grew in the mid-teens. In Europe, growth was led by Industrial, which grew 20% and driven by strong growth in food and environmental. Sales of LC and MS instruments to pharma customers grew high teens as strong capital purchasing patterns continued on from last year.\nUdit already covered our growth by products and services, where instruments grew 26% for the quarter, chemistry grew 8% and service grew 9%, driven by our commercial execution and new product contribution. Finally, TA had another great quarter with sales up 18%, led by strong growth in thermal analysis, microcalorimetry and rheology. Demand for our TA products continue to be strong in all regions, with growth driven by advanced materials and chemicals, including batteries and sustainable polymers.\nNow I would like to comment on our first quarter non-GAAP financial performance versus the prior year. Gross margin for the quarter increased by 40 basis points to 58.6% and despite higher instrument mix, inflation pressures and stronger U.S. dollar. This was driven by volume leverage and pricing.\nOperating margin for the quarter increased by 170 basis points to 30.3%, driven by volume leverage on operating expenses. In the quarter, our effective operating tax rate was 14.8%. Our average share count came in at 61 million shares which is about 1.7 million less than the first quarter of last year. Our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share for the first quarter increased 22% to $2.80 in comparison to $2.29 last year.\nOn a GAAP basis, our earnings per fully diluted share increased to $2.62 compared to $2.37 last year. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached to the press release issued this morning and in the appendix of this presentation.\nTurning to free cash flow, capital deployment and our balance sheet. We define free cash flow as cash from operations, less capital expenditures and excludes special items. In the first quarter of 2022, free cash flow was about 25% of sales at $176 million after funding $28 million of capital expenditures. Excluded from free cash flow was $6 million relating to investment in our Taunton precision chemistry operations.\nIn the first quarter, accounts receivable DSO came in at 81 days, down 3 days compared to first quarter of last year. Given higher sales volume and our proactive measures to secure supply, including building some electronic component safety stock, Inventory increased by approximately $54 million in comparison to the prior year. We maintain a strong balance sheet, access to liquidity and well-structured debt maturity profile. This strength allows us the ability to prioritize investing in growth, including M&A and returning capital to shareholders.\nWe continue to evaluate M&A opportunities that will meaningfully accelerate value creation in well thought-out attractive, high market, high-growth adjusting opportunity. In Q1, we repurchased approximately 493,000 shares of our common stock for $160 million. At the end of the quarter, our net debt position was $941 million with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of about 0.9%.\nNow as we look ahead for the remainder of the year, I would like to provide some updated context on our thoughts for 2022, which is on Slide 10. We've had a strong start to the year, driven by robust end market demand and strong commercial execution across our geographies. As we look ahead, we expect solid momentum to continue and that our near-term growth initiatives will continue to contribute to our performance. We also expect that we will be able to continue to address supply chain constraints and inflationary pressures, and these challenges do not worsen over the remainder of the year. These dynamics support increasing the full year 2022 guidance to 7.5% to 9% constant currency sales growth, up from our initial guide in February of 5% to 7%.\nAt current rates, a negative currency translation is expected to subtract approximately 3 percentage points, resulting in full year reported sales growth guidance of 4.5% to 6%. Gross margin for the full year is expected to be approximately 58.5% and operating margin is expected to be approximately 30.5%. We expect our full year net interest expense to be approximately $35 million and full year tax rate to be approximately 15.5%. Average diluted 2022 share count is expected to be approximately 60.6 million. Our share repurchase program will continue into 2022, and we'll provide quarterly updates as appropriate. Rolling all this together and on a non-GAAP basis, we are raising our full year 2022 earnings per fully diluted share guidance to the range of $11.90 to $12.10. This includes negative currency impact of approximately 4 percentage points or $0.45 at current rates.\nLooking at the second quarter of 2022, we expect constant currency sales growth to be 6% to 8%. At current rates, currency translation is expected to subtract approximately 4 percentage points, resulting in second quarter reported sales growth guidance of 2% to 4%. Given the ongoing lockdowns in China, we anticipate a headwind of approximately 100 to 200 basis points to our growth for the second quarter, assuming lockdowns do not worsen, which is factored in our second quarter guidance.\nSecond quarter non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share are estimated to be in the range of $2.55 to $2.65. This includes a negative currency impact of approximately 5 percentage points or $0.13 at current rates. Now I would like to turn it back to Udit for some summary comments. Udit?\n\nUdit Batra\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Waters Corporation\n\nThank you, Amol. So in summary, our teams continue to deliver excellent results despite the challenging environment with strong instrument growth and great traction for our new instrument products. We are laser focused on execution, innovation and growth. We continue to make progress executing against our enterprise priorities with our core initiatives delivering positively and contributing positively to our results.\nWith that, we will now begin the Q&A session.

Udit?\n\nUdit Batra\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Waters Corporation\n\nThank you, Caspar, and good morning, everyone. Before diving in, I would like to extend our thoughts and our prayers to the thousands of those who're affected in Turkey and ceria by the earthquakes. Today, marks a major milestone in accelerating value creation for our customers and shareholders as we progress to the next step in the execution of our strategy. This morning, we made the exciting announcement that Wyatt Technology, the recognized leader in light scattering, will be joining forces with Waters, bringing with it a fast-growing, attractive business with key capabilities to accelerate our $1.8 billion double-digit growth opportunity in bioprocess characterization.\nMore than 40 years ago, Wyatt was the first to commercialize light scattering instruments, incorporating lasers as their light source. Ever since, they've defined and redefined state-of-the-art light scattering instrumentation, software and services. Along the way, they've also added several related technologies, including dynamic light scattering, viscometry, refractometry and field-flow fractionation. Together, their innovative products are used to determine the properties of novel therapeutics, such as cell and gene therapy, vaccines and proteins as well as synthetic polymers and nanoparticles.\nWyatt was the top asset and priority we identified for bioanalytical characterization, making the acquisition a significant step forward in this high-growth adjacencies. I would like to take this opportunity to invite Jeff and Cliff to say a few words about this exciting combination. Jeff?\n\nGeofrey Wyatt\n\nThank you, Udit. We are thrilled to be with you here today at this incredible moment for our company. For over 4 decades, Wyatt Technology has delighted customers with industry-leading innovation in light scattering, characterizing life-enhancing large molecule therapeutics. Our common scientific heritage, deep mutual respect for science-based innovation and a passion for customer success makes Waters the ideal steward to propel our family legacy into its next chapter. Now Cliff, would you like to add anything?\n\nClifford Wyatt\n\nThank you, Jeff, I would like to echo your comments and also my father's, Dr. Wyatt's sentiment that we could not have been more excited or could not be more excited about this combination. Waters will broaden Wyatt's global reach, scale and will accelerate deployment of light scattering technologies in downstream and QA/QC spaces integrating this technology onto Water's well-established Empower platform. Waters is such a natural and logical fit for us in this next exciting chapter of Wyatt's history.\n\nUdit Batra\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Waters Corporation\n\nThank you, Jeff, and thank you, Cliff. We are honored to get this unique opportunity to carry Wyatt forward into the future. This combination is a fantastic opportunity to integrate our powerful analytical technologies, which are highly complementary to each other. And as you highlighted, Jeff, our shared deep scientific culture and common passion for customer success will accelerate integration and drive value creation for our customers and shareholders in the years to come.\nToday, Waters has a strong and growing portfolio serving large molecule separation and characterization, which are approximately 30% of our pharmaceutical revenues. These applications serve high-volume downstream workflows in biologic development and QA/QC central labs using LC/UV and LC mass spec. Wyatt's significant exposure to the very fast-growing biologic applications will build on this presence and will give our customers an unmatched set of analytical solutions across large molecules, including gene therapy and viral vectors.\nFor Wyatt, as Cliff mentioned, this combination will provide expanded geographic reach and will accelerate the adoption of light scattering in downstream applications through our established presence and Empower Informatics platform.\nAs you can tell, we're excited to share more details about the strategic benefits of this combination. However, this is our fourth quarter and our full year's earnings call, and we have some excellent results to share with you first. So now I will cover our key messages and financial results for the core business. Then we will continue outlining the value of this combination as we take this next step in the evolution of our strategy.\nLooking at our financial results, we ended another very successful year, delivering strong results in the fourth quarter, with growth across our end markets. This was led by yet another outstanding double-digit instrument growth quarter. Our incredible performance this year would not have been possible without our dedicated and talented colleagues. We overcame numerous macroeconomic and pandemic-related challenges throughout 2022, including global supply chain challenges, COVID lockdowns, inflationary pressures and currency headwinds, all while responding to high customer demand for our products.\nToday, we have 3 key messages, which reflect the strength in our core business and the exciting future that lies ahead. First, we continue to deliver consistently strong execution. You can see this in our 2022 performance, where we sustained strong growth after a stellar year in 2021.\nYou can also see this in our 3-year CAGR of approximately 9% in constant currency, where our results have placed us amongst the top players in the industry since the beginning of our transformation.\nSecond, our revitalized portfolio has contributed to our growth, and we expect this to continue. New products have resulted in growth opportunities in large molecule applications, PFAS and battery testing, while supporting strong core instrument replacement.\nThird, while we have accomplished a lot in the past 2.5 years, we are now augmenting our organic efforts with M&A to accelerate our journey into high-growth adjacencies.\nTurning now to our fourth quarter results. Our revenue grew 3% as reported, and 9% on a constant currency basis. We saw broad strength across our end markets and regions with robust customer demand. Industrial was again our fastest-growing end market, up 14%, led by environmental testing, which grew over 20%, and TA, which grew mid-teens.\nPharma saw continued robust growth, up 6%, with strength in both small and large molecule applications. Strength was led by Europe, which grew low double digits, offset by headwinds in China. Academic and government grew 8% as increased activity and funded -- funding resulted in strong year-end spending in several of our geographies.\nInstruments grew double digits, led by mass spec. New products contributed across our portfolio with Arc HPLC, ACQUITY Premier and Cyclic unit sales growing over 40%. Meanwhile, our newest instrument launches, Xevo TQ Absolute and Xevo G3 saw excellent continued traction with very strong demand.\nRecurring revenues grew high single digits, supported by our e-commerce and service attachment growth initiatives. Our Q4 non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share was $3.84. This is up 5% year-over-year despite FX headwinds of 8%. For the full year, revenue grew 7% as reported, and 12% in constant currency.\n2022 was a very strong year for Waters, where we executed well throughout the organization against a challenging macroeconomic environment. Our growth was broad-based across our geographies and end markets, each of which grew low double digits or above. This strength was led by instrument sales, which grew 16% for the year, with LC, mass spec and TA systems, all growing double digits. For the full year, non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share was $12.02. This is up 7% year-over-year despite FX headwinds of 9%.\nNow as we enter 2023, our end markets remain robust and healthy, with strong customer demand for our products. These attractive end markets have durable growth drivers and are well funded. We saw solid order growth in the fourth quarter, and our backlog remains at elevated levels. We expect the strong instrument sales we saw in 2022 to drive future growth in our recurring revenues. So our end markets are healthy. We've regained our commercial momentum. Innovation has been revitalized, and we have strengthened our organization with new leadership capabilities, bringing a proven track record in transformation. Now we're entering the next phase of our execution strategy as we accelerate our path toward faster growth.\nThis brings us now to the chart on the next slide. As you can see, biologics manufacturing is a complex process. And we have shared an example, which shows how large-scale monoclonal antibodies are produced. It starts with the upstream production of the drug substance, where the raw material components are fingerprinted and monitored during initial cell culture creation before the protein or antibody of choice is produced.\nThen in downstream manufacturing, cells and debris are separated from the map in a series of filtration and separation steps. Each step involves numerous stages of testing to ensure that the product is stable and effective.\nThen, as a last step, in QA/QC, the final purified drug product is formulated and filled in vials of prefilled syringes. Throughout the process, different tools and technologies are required for characterization, depending upon what you need to analyze. Liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection or LC/UV, is used extensively across all 4 stages.\nAt the same time, mass spec is increasingly being used with BioAccord seeing a lot of traction in cell culture media characterization, clone selection and process optimization in both upstream and downstream manufacturing. It is also seeing adoption in QA/QC applications. We shared details on this at the beginning of the year and have included a slide in the appendix.\nIn addition to LC/UV and LC/MS, powerful techniques such as dynamic light scattering and multi-angle light scattering are also used to give relevant information about the size, molecular weight and aggregation of biologics. By combining the data from each of these detectors, our customers can develop a more comprehensive profile of their biologics. This is essential to speeding up the manufacturing process and reducing the cost of complex biologics such as cell and gene therapies.\nThe bioanalytical characterization market is around $1.8 billion, growing around 10% to 12%. Waters already has a strong established position in LC/UV and LC mass spec, whereas Wyatt Technology is a pioneer in light scattering. Hence, this combination is a fantastic opportunity to integrate our powerful analytical technologies, which are highly complementary to each other and will accelerate our journey in this opportunity.\nLet me now ask Jeff to describe the company and its highly innovative portfolio. Jeff?\n\nGeofrey Wyatt\n\nThanks, again, Udit. Well, Wyatt is a remarkable company, and we owe much of its success in high-growth applications to our amazing team. Our flagship technology is multi-angle light scattering, MALS, which is used by leading biopharma, biotech and academic institutions to measure fundamental properties of complex biologics, including cell and gene therapies, mRNA vaccines, biopolymers, biosimilars and therapeutic proteins. We're based here in Santa Barbara, California, and have 225 outstanding employees, of whom roughly 25% have PhDs. Over the past 40 years, we've built Wyatt into the recognized leader in light scattering detection, defining the segment very much like Waters did for liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry.\nOur sales have grown around 20% on a 3-year CAGR to approximately $110 million in 2022. We're also a highly profitable business with an adjusted operating margin of approximately 40%.\nMore than 80% of our revenues are in large molecule applications. Our biopharma customers are eager to use light scattering for QA/QC applications and have been keen for us to combine our software with Empower. So you can only imagine how excited we are with this combination, which will add additional choices and capabilities for our existing customers and let us delight even more. Now back to you, Udit.\n\nUdit Batra\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Waters Corporation\n\nThank you, Jeff. I look forward to welcoming our new colleagues to Waters. Let's now talk about some of the benefits that integrating Wyatt and Waters' capabilities would provide for our customers. In our existing Waters portfolio, our LC systems separate, complex mixtures into individual constituents for both property analysis by UV and detailed characterization by mass spec. These are properties such as titer aggregation and protein segments.\nThe missing piece has been additional critical information about the intact molecule, like the empty/full capsid ratio of adeno-associated viruses, or the size of lipid nanoparticles for mRNA therapies. These will be augmented by Wyatt's MALS detectors, which would allow our customers to develop a more comprehensive critical quality attribute profile for their biologics. This is essential to fully characterizing their manufacturing process.\nIn each case, for these tools to gain successful adoption in point-of-use settings, they must be, #1, sophisticated but simple for use in high-volume applications such as what we've already demonstrated with BioAccord. #2, supported by leading service like Waters already has to help run workflows and respond to evolving needs. And #3, and most importantly, they need to be connected to a common informatics platform so that all the data comes together in one place.\nOur ambition is to create an ecosystem of sophisticated yet simple instruments that can all use Empower to collect data and submit to regulators, no differently than what Waters established for small molecules years ago.\nThis transaction will create a number of compelling revenue synergies and results in an attractive set of pro forma financials. First, from a geographic footprint, Waters revenues are highly diversified, whereas Wyatt's presence is concentrated in the United States. This provides us an opportunity to expand Wyatt's geographic footprint in Europe and Asia, particularly in China.\nSecond, HPLC instruments and size exclusion chemistry columns are sold together with light scattering instruments. We expect to see cross-selling synergies with our liquid chromatography instruments and chemistry. Third, Wyatt's instruments and expertise will enable Waters to meaningfully accelerate the high-growth adjacency opportunity in bioanalytical characterization. This will give our customers an unmatched set of analytical solutions across large molecule applications, and will augment our ability to create a comprehensive bioanalytical platform.\nAnd fourth, Wyatt's portfolio is well established in upstream development, settings for large molecule applications today. Waters' Empower platform, as well as presence -- as well as our presence and expertise in high-volume downstream recurring applications will accelerate the use of light scattering in biologics manufacturing and in QA/QC.\nNow to the pro forma. The combination will increase our large molecule footprint to around 35% of our pharmaceutical revenues. Our increased exposure to these faster-growing markets will raise the combined growth profile of the markets we serve by at least 50 basis points. We expect the transaction to contribute more than 60 basis points to our annualized constant currency growth over the next 5 years. We also expected to add more than 50 basis points to our industry-leading adjusted operating margin.\nNet, we expect to realize a high single-digit plus return on invested capital by year 5. Although we expect the Wyatt's business to grow low double digits in the near to midterm, in addition, we expect this combination to create more than $70 million in annualized revenue synergies by year 5.\nNow I would like to pass the call to Amol to walk us through further details on the financing. He will then continue covering our fourth quarter financial performance and provide our guidance for 2023. Amol?\n\nAmol Chaubal\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Waters Corporation\n\nThank you, Udit, and good morning, everyone. It's been great to work with Jeff, Cliff and the entire team at Wyatt Technology. Like Udit, I'm very thankful to the Wyatt family for considering us as the rightful stewards of their mission and legacy and for providing us this opportunity to create value for our customers and for our shareholders.\nNow with the transaction highlights. This $1.36 billion investment will result in immediate accretion of our revenue growth and our adjusted operating margin percentage. The synergies that Udit just described, along with Wyatt's highly attractive financials, are expected to result in accretive non-GAAP EPS impact as early as first quarter of 2024.\nAltogether, as Udit mentioned, this combination is expected to deliver a high single-digit plus return on invested capital by year 5. We will fund this investment through cash on our balance sheet and existing debt capacity that is available on our revolver. On day 1, our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio will be around 2.3. We will temporarily suspend our share buyback program for the remainder of 2023, and will utilize our free cash flow to pay down the debt through the rest of the year.\nWe expect our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio to land at around 1.7 by year-end 2023. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of this year, subject to regulatory approval and customary closing conditions.\nNow to our fourth quarter financial results. We delivered an excellent close to a very strong year for Waters, with constant currency growth of 9%. Waters Division grew 8% and TA grew 15%. By end market, Pharma grew 6%, Industrial grew 14% and academic and government grew 8%, which Udit already covered.\nBy geography, sales in Asia grew 7%, Americas grew 8% and Europe grew 11%. In Asia, growth in region overall was strong. Japan grew 25% and India grew 15%. China declined low single digits for the quarter as a sharp increase in COVID infections at year-end resulted in delayed spending due to customer site closures. We expect these headwinds from the post zero COVID reopening to continue into the first quarter of 2023 before catching up throughout the remainder of the year.\nIn other regions, the U.S. grew 8% and Europe grew 11% with broad strength across end markets. By products and services, Instruments grew 10%, led by mass spec, which grew over 30%. Recurring revenues grew 7%, with Chemistry up 8% and Service up 7%. Finally, TA grew 15%, with double-digit growth across our major geographies. Growth was led by sales in electronics and battery applications as well as strong growth in advanced materials and chemical testing.\nLooking now at our full year results. By end market, Pharma grew 10%, Industrial grew 15% and academic and government grew 13%. In pharma, growth was led by large molecule applications, which grew mid-teens, while small molecule grew high single digits. By geography, sales in Asia grew 12%, Americas grew 14% and Europe grew 10%.\nBy products and services, Instruments grew 16% for the full year, with liquid chromatography, mass spec and TA system sales all up double digits. In our recurring revenues, chemistry grew 9%, supported by our strong launch of MaxPeak Premier Columns in large molecule applications and further expansion in digital commerce adoption.\nService grew 8% with continued expansion in attachment rates, which increased 150 basis points in 2022 and have increased 350 basis points since 2019.\nNow I would like to comment on our fourth quarter and full year non-GAAP financial performance versus the prior year. Gross margin for the quarter was 59.4%, up 140 basis points versus prior year, driven by sales volume and pricing, partially offset by inflationary costs. For the full year, gross margin came in as expected at 58%. Operating margin for the quarter was 33.7%, growth of 110 basis points versus prior year, driven by gross margin dynamics.\nFor the full year, operating margin was approximately 30.2%, which was flat with last year. On an underlying basis, we expanded our operating margins by approximately 100 basis points versus our guide of 20 to 30 basis points at the beginning of the year. This is net of our investments in higher growth adjacencies and despite the higher instrument mix in our revenue.\nOn an as-reported basis, our expansion was offset by 80 basis points of FX headwinds and 20 basis points of additional compensation to help our colleagues with the temporary impacts of inflation. In the quarter, our effective operating tax rate was 17.6%, and for the full year, it was 15.6%. For the full year, as anticipated, our effective tax rate increased by 180 basis points, primarily due to change regarding the capitalization of R&D costs. Average share count came in at 59.6 million shares, which is about 1.8 million less than the fourth quarter of last year.\nOur non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share for the fourth quarter increased 5% to $3.84 compared to $3.67 last year. Foreign exchange headwinds lowered our non-GAAP EPS growth by 8%. On a GAAP basis, our earnings per fully diluted share was $3.81. For the full year, our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share increased 7% to $12.02 versus $11.20 in the prior year. The foreign exchange headwind lowered our non-GAAP EPS growth by 9%. On a GAAP basis, full year earnings per share was $11.73.\nTurning to free cash flow, capital deployment and our balance sheet. We define free cash flow as cash from operations, less capital expenditures and excludes special items. In the fourth quarter of 2022, free cash flow was $145 million after funding $62 million of capital expenditures. Excluded from the free cash flow was $8 million related to the investment in our Taunton Precision Chemistry operations.\nIn the quarter, we continued to build inventory to secure supply and build safety stock given strong instrument demand. For the full year, free cash flow was $506 million after funding $176 million of capital expenditures and includes approximately $100 million of additional inventory versus the prior year-end. Excluding -- excluded from the free cash flow was $32 million related to the investment in our Taunton Precision Chemistry operations and a $38 million tax reform payment.\nWe maintain a strong balance sheet, access to liquidity and a well-structured debt maturity profile. This strength allows us the ability to prioritize investing in growth, including M&A, which will meaningfully accelerate value creation in well-thought-out attractive adjacent markets.\nIn Q4, we repurchased approximately 475,000 shares of our common stock for $149 million. At the end of the quarter, our net debt position was approximately $1.1 billion, with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of about 1.1.\nNow as we look towards the year ahead, I would like to provide you with our thoughts for 2023. We have seen strong performance throughout 2022, driven by robust end market demand, excellent commercial execution across our geographies and new product introductions driving growth. As we enter 2023, we expect our sales momentum to remain solid in our durable end markets, and that our refreshed portfolio and growth initiatives will continue to enhance our performance.\nThese dynamics support a full year 2023 guidance of organic constant currency sales growth of 5% to 6.5%, excluding Wyatt. At current rates, negative currency translation is expected to subtract approximately 1 percentage point, resulting in full year reported organic sales growth guidance of 4% to 5.5%. We expect the Wyatt transaction to close in the second quarter of 2023. And depending on the timing, we expect it to add approximately 2% to 3% to our full year 2023 revenue growth. Therefore, our total reported sales growth guidance is 6% to 8.5% versus 2022, including Wyatt.\nFor the full year 2023, organic gross margin is expected to be approximately 58%, and organic operating margin is expected to be approximately 30%. Before FX, this includes 20 to 30 basis points of net margin expansion after 70 to 80 basis points of investment in high-growth adjacencies. FX is expected to be a headwind of 50 basis points, particularly in the first half of the year.\nThe addition of Wyatt in Q2 is expected to be accretive to our full year 2023 adjusted operating margin by 20 to 30 basis points. Excluding the transaction, we expect our full year net interest expense to be approximately $42 million. The transaction is expected to add $27 million to $43 million of additional interest expense, depending on the timing of the close. The full year tax rate is expected to remain at approximately 15.5%.\nSince we will be temporarily suspending our share repurchase program for the remainder of the year, and using free cash flow to pay down debt, our average diluted 2023 share count is expected to be approximately 59.5 million.\nRolling all this together, on a non-GAAP basis, our full year 2023 earnings per fully diluted share guidance, excluding the transaction, is projected in the range of $12.70 to $12.90. This represents 6% to 7% growth versus last year and includes a negative currency impact of approximately 3 percentage points at current FX rates. The Wyatt transaction is expected to be accretive to EPS as early as in the first quarter of 2024. And this is even net of our share buyback suspension for the remainder of 2023. Overall, we expect it to deliver a high single-digit plus adjusted return on invested capital, net of tax by year 5.\nDue to interest expense incurred on higher debt balance, and the suspension of share repurchase program this year, the transaction is expected to result in a 2023 EPS headwind of approximately $0.15. Hence, including Wyatt, non-GAAP full year 2023 earnings per fully diluted share is projected in the range of $12.55 to $12.75.\nLooking to the first quarter of 2023, we expect constant currency sales growth to be 4% to 6%, which is 10% to 11% on a 2-year stacked growth. At today's rates, currency translation is expected to subtract approximately 4 percentage points, resulting in first quarter reported sales growth guidance of flat to 2%. First quarter non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share are estimated to be in the range of $2.55 to $2.65, with a negative currency impact of approximately 6 percentage points.\nNow I would like to turn it back to Udit for some summary comments. Udit?\n\nUdit Batra\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Waters Corporation\n\nThank you, Amol. As I outlined at the beginning of our transformation journey and later at our Investor Day last year, our first focus was to regain our commercial momentum and strengthen our organization with new leadership capabilities. As you have observed over the last 2.5 years, we have delivered incredible results with consistently strong execution. And we have assembled an amazing leadership team that brings with it a proven track record in transformation, which is pivotal to driving seamless integration.\nOur second focus was to revitalize our portfolio. The success of our new product launches, the increased vitality index of our portfolio and the rich pipeline ahead of us underscores our accomplishments this year. Today, we're entering our next phase, which is to accelerate value creation for our customers and shareholders by adding a fantastic, fast-growing technology platform and increasing our capabilities to address high-growth adjacent markets.\nSo with that, I'll turn the call back over to Caspar.\n\nCaspar Tudor\n\nManage of Investor Relation, Waters Corporation\n\nThank you, Udit. That concludes our formal comments, and we are now ready to open the phone lines for questions."

Welcome to the Waters Corporation First Quarter 2023 Financial Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] This conference call is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, please disconnect at this time. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Caspar Tudor, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead.\n\nCaspar Tudor\n\nManage of Investor Relation\n\nThank you, Brad. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Waters Corporation first quarter earnings call. Today, I'm joined by Dr. Udit Batra, Water's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Amol Chaubal, Waters' Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nBefore we begin, I will cover the cautionary language. In this conference call, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the company. In particular, we will provide guidance regarding possible future results and commentary on potential market and business conditions, including with respect to the close of the Wyatt transaction that impacts Waters Corporation over the second quarter of 2023 and full year 2023.\nThese statements are only our present expectations and actual events or results may differ materially. For more details, please see the risk factors included in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K, our Form 10-Qs and the cautionary language included in this morning's earnings release.\nDuring today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including in our discussions of the results of operations. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are attached to our earnings release issued this morning and in the appendix of our presentation, which are available on the company's website.\nUnless stated otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the first quarter of fiscal year 2022. In addition, unless stated otherwise, all year-over-year revenue growth rates and ranges given on today's call are given on a comparable constant currency basis.\nFinally, we do not intend to update our predictions or projections, except as part of a regularly scheduled quarterly earnings release or as otherwise required by law.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Udit to deliver our key messages for the quarter, then Amol will provide a more detailed look at our financial results. After, we will open up the phone lines to take questions.\n\nUdit Batra\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThank you, Caspar, and good morning, everyone. So this morning, I'll start by giving you color on our first quarter results as well as our updated guidance. Then I will cover some of our recent product launches, including Alliance IS, and I will also provide an update on Wyatt.\nOur first quarter results were below our expectations with revenue growth of 3% on a constant currency basis versus our expected 4% to 6% growth. This was largely driven by weaker-than-expected demand for instruments in biotech and pharma, which I will cover in a moment. As you know, we had an extraordinary Q1 last year with 16% constant currency growth.\nEven though our first quarter this year was slower than expected, it still represents a very healthy 2-year stacked growth of approximately 9.4%. We also saw overall good overall strength in our recurring revenues, which continued to grow in the high single digits as well as mass spec and DA, both of which grew double digits.\nOur end markets remain resilient, and our leadership team continues to drive strong commercial execution. We have further strengthened our revitalized portfolio with a steady stream of innovative new products.\nFinally, we've added M&A to our growth strategy with our pending acquisition of Wyatt. And we continue to invest organically in our high-growth adjacencies, which are also on track and are gaining momentum.\nReviewing our first quarter results in more detail, our performance was impacted by a combination of 3 factors: first, China was weaker than anticipated as pharma customers scale back purchases. Second, while we have limited exposure to pre-commercial biotech, we have seen a pronounced scale back in demand from these customers as they have significantly reduced spending to conserve capital. And third, several of our large to medium-sized pharma customers delayed timing of instrument orders due to macroeconomic caution.\nEach of these dynamics occurred late in the quarter and led to instruments declining 3% after they grew over 25% in the first quarter of last year.\nBy end market, the impact was to our pharma business, which declined 4% overall. This was offset by strength in the Academic and Government segment, which grew 45% and Industrial, which grew 3%, while our recurring revenues remained strong across service and chemistry.\nAs a result of this lower-than-expected volume, our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted shares also came below our expectations at $2.49 for the first quarter. On a GAAP basis, our earnings per fully diluted share was $2.38.\nAs we look ahead, we are assuming that spending among pharma customers in China will remain scale back for the balance of the year. And while our exposure to pre-commercial biotech is low, we also believe that the slowdown in this space is likely to persist for the remainder of the year. As a result, we're lowering our 2023 guide due to these 2 factors.\nWe now expect our full year organic constant currency growth to be in the range of 3% to 5%. We believe that large to medium pharma size budgets remain in place. We expect spending among these customers to catch up and be stronger in the second half of the year after delayed spending in the first half.\nDespite our revised revenue guide, our full year EPS guidance and free cash flow generation expectations remain unchanged. We intend to proactively manage our spend and working capital and Amol will cover this in more detail.\nEven with short-term market challenges, our sources for growth remain intact. Our end markets are robust with almost 80% of our business exposed to durable growth areas. This includes demand for QA/QC testing of commercialized medicines, increased scrutiny of PFAS in food and water and the testing of batteries used in applications such as electric vehicles.\nOur team has developed a strong commercial discipline that is supported by best-in-class innovative new products that address evolving customer unmet needs. We're also seeing high single-digit growth in our recurring revenues, which are over 50% of our annual sales.\nChemistry growth is supported by strong end-market activity, growth in biologic applications with our MaxPeak Premier Columns and our e-commerce initiative. For service, we're seeing strong pull-through from our instrument sales and increased service plan attachment is supporting the growth.\nWe expect service plan attachment for our instruments to increase by another 100 basis points this year, building on the 350 basis point expansion since 2019. Our revitalized portfolio has been further strengthened with the recent launch of Alliance IS, which is our next-generation intelligent HPLC system.\nWe believe it is the most significant innovation to hit pharma QA/QC in the past decade, and it provides a major leap forward in lab productivity. Not only is the instrument easy to use with its large touchscreen interface but can eliminate common user errors by up to 40%. It does this by guiding users between steps with a highly intuitive interface. It intelligently conducts a number of real-time system checks before a sample is run. This helps ensure that the instrument is configured correctly for the method that is being tested.\nBefore now, errors such as incorrect solvent or the wrong column being used are usually discovered after the sample has been run, which results in wasted time and a wasted sample. Given the strength of the Alliance brand and the significant new features that this instrument offers, we had a strong reception at its launch.\nSince quality testing is such a critical component of pharmaceutical manufacturing, customer interest has been strong, including from Janssen Pharmaceuticals, who noted that Alliance IS feels like the future is here. and has already made plans to replace a large number of its LCs with this instrument.\nWe now have not 1, but 2 new industry-leading platforms for QA/QC applications in pharma, Arc HPLC and its biocompatible equivalent are premier and now higher-end Alliance IS, which sits at the top of the range. Last month, we also launched our Xevo TQ Absolute mass spec into clinical applications. Not only is this the most sensitive Triple Quad on the market for PFAS detection, where it has seen strong traction in food and environmental testing, but now within clinical, it is up to 5x more sensitive than other competing instruments in the segment.\nThis sensitivity enables clinical labs to detect and measure trace level analytes at lower detection levels than was previously possible. It also enables Pinnacle Labs to expand their test menu to include multiplex panels.\nMeanwhile, our TA Instruments business launched a new microcalorimeter for battery testing essentially for electric vehicles, energy storage and electronics applications. This provides customers with a significant upgrade as it accelerates validation of battery safety, quality and performance testing by up to 75%, while collecting up to 6x more data than other calorie meters.\nLastly, we also recently launched a new system monitoring software product on WatersConnect, first for us and unique to the industry, developed in consultation with QA/QC scientists it enables real-time monitoring of all chromatography instruments controlled by our Empower software. It helps increase productivity of QA/QC labs by allowing customers to analyze their instrument fleet at any time from anywhere to monitor uptime, usage levels and real-time system availability.\nEach of these new products have been developed in close collaboration with our customers to address their most pressing unmet needs. They further support the strength of our revitalized portfolio.\nEarlier this year, we announced our intent to acquire Wyatt Technology, the recognized leader in light scattering. With more than 80% of its revenues tied to large molecule applications, Wyatt expands Waters' portfolio increases -- and increases our exposure to faster growth areas within biologics.\nIt also increases our ability to build a business in bioanalytical characterization, which is a USD 1.8 billion total addressable market with a 10% to 12% projected annual growth rate. We remain on track to close in the second quarter of this year. We also expect the transition to deliver immediate growth and adjusted operating margin accretion.\nNow I will pass the call over to Amol to continue covering our first quarter financial results and give additional commentary on our guidance. Amol?\n\nAmol Chaubal\n\nSenior VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Udit, and good morning, everyone. In the first quarter, sales grew 3% in constant currency. This came below our expectations due to the demand dynamics in our Pharma business, which Udit outlined earlier.\nWaters division grew 2% and TA grew 10%. By end market, Pharma declined 4%, Industrial grew 3% and Academic and Government was very strong at 45% growth.\nIn Pharma, weakness was led by China and the U.S. In China, we saw customers recalibrate their spending plans. And in the U.S., our large to medium pharma customers delayed spending due to macroeconomic caution. Our small biotech customers, which is a small portion of our business, scale back spending to conserve capital in light of more pronounced funding concerns.\nIn Industrial, growth was led by Asia, which grew 6% and the Americas, which grew 2%. In our Waters business, we saw continued strong growth in PFAS testing applications. In TA, growth was led by thermal analysis and rheology. We have seen continued strong demand in secular growth drivers such as batteries and electronic testing.\nAcademic and Government had a great start to the year as elevated funding resulted in strong demand for our refreshed mass spec portfolio. Strength was broad across all our geographies. By product, strength was broad across our high-res mass specs, such as Cyclic IMS and our tandem cards, such as TQ Absolute.\nNow by geography, sales in Asia grew 6%. The Americas declined 1% and Europe grew 3%. In Asia, China declined mid-single digits for the quarter. Excluding China, Asia grew mid-teens with broad strength across our end markets. In the Americas, Pharma declined mid-single digits given delayed spending against a tough comp of over 30%.\nIndustrial grew 2% and Academic and Government grew over 25%. Europe grew 3% in the quarter with strength also led by Academic and Government, which grew over 40%. By products and services, instruments declined 3% overall, but both our mass spec and TA Instrument systems grew double digits.\nRecurring revenues grew 8% with chemistry up 10% and service up 8%. This quarter had 1 fewer day than the first quarter of 2022, which translates to a headwind of approximately 1% for our recurring revenues. Gross margin for the quarter was 58.5% compared to 58.6% in the first quarter of 2022, in line with our expectations.\nOperating margin for the quarter was approximately 26.8% compared to 30.3% in the first quarter of 2022 driven by sales mix and 120 basis points of unfavorable FX. Our effective operating tax rate for the quarter was 15.4%. Average share count came in at 59.3 million shares, which is about $1.6 million less than the first quarter of last year.\nOur non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share for the first quarter was $2.49 in comparison to $2.80 last year. Foreign exchange headwinds lowered our non-GAAP EPS growth by 8%. On a GAAP basis, our earnings per fully diluted share was $2.38. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached to the press release issued this morning, and in the appendix of our earnings call presentation.\nTurning to free cash flow, capital deployment and our balance sheet. We define free cash flow as cash from operations, less capital expenditures and excludes special items. In the first quarter of 2023, free cash flow was $166 million after funding $34 million of capital expenditures, which represents approximately 24% of our sales.\nWe maintain a strong balance sheet, access to liquidity and well-structured debt maturity profile. This strength allows us the ability to prioritize investing in growth including M&A and returning capital to shareholders.\nWe continue to evaluate M&A opportunities that will meaningfully accelerate value creation in well thought out attractive adjacent markets. In Q1, we repurchased approximately 173,000 shares of our common stock for $58 million early in the quarter.\nAs we previously disclosed, we have since temporarily suspended our share buyback program for the remainder of the year so that we can use our free cash flow to fund the Wyatt acquisition.\nAt the end of the quarter, our net debt position was approximately $990 million, which is a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of about 1.\nNow I would like to provide our updated thoughts for 2023. Our end markets remain resilient, and we expect our refreshed portfolio and growth initiatives to enhance our performance. However, as Udit covered earlier, we are revising our growth expectations to account for the scale back of purchases from our customers in China and the slowdown in small biotech.\nAs a result, we are updating our full year 2023 organic constant currency sales growth guidance to 3% to 5%, excluding it. At current rates, currency translation is expected to have a minimal impact on full year sales, resulting in full year reported organic sales growth guidance of 3% to 5%.\nConsistent with our prior expectations, we expect Wyatt transaction to add approximately 2.5% to our full year 2023 revenue growth. Therefore, our total reported sales growth guidance is now 5.5% to 7.5% versus 2022, including Wyatt.\nWe expect organic gross margins to be approximately 58.5% for the year and organic operating margins to be approximately 30.5%. This is higher than our previous guide due to anticipated cost savings in our core business and an improvement in FX. This now translates to 50 basis points of margin expansion, net of investment in adjacencies, partially offset by an FX headwind of 20 basis points.\nAs we previously mentioned, we anticipate the expected addition of Wyatt in Q2 of this year will be accretive to our full year 2023 adjusted operating margin by approximately 25 basis points.\nExcluding the Wyatt transaction, we expect our full year net interest expense to be approximately $40 million. Consistent with our prior expectations, the transaction is expected to add $40 million of additional interest expense for a total of $80 million interest expense.\nThe full year tax rate is expected to remain at approximately 15.5%. Our average diluted 2023 share count is expected to be approximately 59.3 million given the temporary suspension of our share repurchase program.\nRolling all this together on a non-GAAP basis, our full year 2023 earnings per fully diluted share guidance, excluding the Wyatt transaction is projected in the range of $12.70 to $12.90 and which is unchanged from our previous guide and includes a negative currency impact of approximately 1 percentage point at current rates.\nIncluding Wyatt, non-GAAP full year 2023 earnings per fully diluted share is also unchanged, projected in the range of $12.55 to $12.75. Looking to the second quarter of 2023, we expect the current market dynamics to persist in China, along with the slowdown in pre-commercial biotech.\nWe also expect cautious spending levels from our large pharma customers to continue until end of the second quarter before catching up in the second half of the year. Hence, we expect second quarter organic constant currency sales growth of 1% to 3%.\nAt today's rates, currency translation is expected to subtract approximately 1 percentage point, resulting in second quarter reported organic sales growth guidance of 0% to 2%. Assuming a mid-May close, we expect the Wyatt transaction to add approximately 1.5% to our second quarter revenue growth.\nTherefore, our total second quarter reported sales growth guidance is 1.5% to 3.5%, including Wyatt. Excluding the Wyatt transaction, second quarter non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share are estimated to be in the range of $2.60 to $2.70 with a negative currency impact of approximately 3 percentage points. Including Wyatt, which is expected to result in an EPS headwind of $0.08 Second quarter non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share is projected in the range of $2.52 to $2.62.\nNow I would like to turn it back to Udit for some summary comments. Udit?\n\nUdit Batra\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThank you, Amol. So to summarize, despite a slower-than-expected start to the year, our end markets are resilient, and we expect to see increased trends in the second half of the year.\nWhile we have revised our revenue guide, we're maintaining our full year EPS guide due to our robust financial model. And the acceleration of our growth strategy remains on track with continued progress on all of our high-growth adjacencies and with our pending acquisition of Wyatt Technology.\nI would like to take this opportunity to thank our colleagues around the world who continue to demonstrate the indomitable spirit of Waters with their focus on strong commercial execution and revitalized innovation. We also look forward to welcoming our future Wyatt colleagues.\nFinally, I'm proud to share that Waters continues to be globally recognized for its strong ESG profile, placing at #5, on the Barron's 100 Most Sustainable Companies list for 2023. This is the second year that we've been placed in the top 10 after receiving more than 20 awards in 2022 recognizing the company for excellence in product innovation, leadership strength and commitment to social and environmental responsibility. We look forward to continuing to demonstrate our commitment to leave the world better than we found it.\nSo with that, I'll turn the call back to Caspar.\n\nCaspar Tudor\n\nManage of Investor Relation\n\nThanks, Udit. That concludes our formal comments, and we are now ready to open the phone lines for questions."

This call is being recorded for rebroadcast.\n(Operator Instructions)\nBefore the conference call begins, I remind you that all statements in the presentation, other than historical facts, are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that are subject to change at any time. Such statements are based on management's expectations at the time they are made. In addition to the assumptions and other factors refer to in connection with the statements, factors described in WEC Energy Group's latest Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated.\nDuring the discussions, referenced earnings per share will be based on diluted earnings per share, unless otherwise noted. After the presentation, the conference will be open to analysts for questions and answers. In conjunction with this call, a package of detailed financial information is posted at wecenergygroup.com.\nA replay will be available approximately 2 hours after the call. And now it is my pleasure to introduce Gale Klappa, Executive Chairman of WEC Energy Group.\n\nGale E. Klappa\n\nExecutive Chairman, WEC Energy Group, Inc.\n\nWell, good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today as we review our results for calendar year 2021. First, I'd like to introduce, as always, the members of our management team who are here with me today. We have Scott Lauber, who's now our President and Chief Executive; Xia Liu, our Chief Financial Officer; and Beth Straka, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations.\nAs you saw from our news release this morning, we reported full year 2021 earnings of $4.11 a share. This exceeded the upper end of our most recent guidance, which was $4.07 a share. Our positive results were driven by favorable weather, solid economic recovery in our region and our continued focus on operating efficiency. Our balance sheet and cash flows remain strong. And as we've discussed, this allows us to fund a highly executable capital plan without issuing equity. I would also note that the earnings we're reporting today are quality earnings with no adjustments. As you know, we've been very active in shaping the future of clean energy.\nLooking back on 2021, we set some of the most aggressive goals in our industry for reducing carbon emissions. Across our generating fleet, we're targeting a 60% reduction in carbon emissions by 2025 and an 80% reduction by the end of 2030, all from a 2005 baseline. In fact, by the end of 2030, we expect our use of coal for power generation will be immaterial and our plan calls for a complete exit from coal by the year 2035. Of course, for the longer term, we remain focused on achieving net 0 carbon emissions from power generation by 2050. Now we all recognize that advances in technology will be needed to decarbonize the economy by 2050. And hydrogen, of course, could be a key player, a key part of the solution in the decades ahead.\nTo that end, we announced last week 1 of the first hydrogen power pilot programs of its kind in the United States. We're joining with the Electric Power Research Institute to test hydrogen as a fuel source at one of our newer natural gas-powered units located in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. The project will be carried out this year, and the results will be shared across the industry to demonstrate how the use of hydrogen could materially reduce carbon emissions.\nSwitching gears now, we're driving forward on our $17.7 billion ESG progress plan, the largest 5-year plan in the company's history. The plan is focused on efficiency, sustainability and growth. One of the highlights is the planned investment in nearly 2,400 megawatts of renewable capacity over the next 5 years. These renewable projects will serve the customers of our regulated utilities here in Wisconsin. Overall, we expect the ESG progress plan to support average growth in our asset base of 7% a year driving earnings growth, dividend growth and dramatically improved environmental performance.\nIn summary, we believe we're poised to deliver among the very best risk-adjusted returns our industry has to offer. And now let's take a brief look at the regional economy. We saw a promising recovery throughout 2021 despite the prolonged pandemic. The latest available data show Wisconsin's unemployment rate down at 2.8%; folks, that's a record low and more than a full percentage point below the national average. Importantly, jobs in the manufacturing sectors across Wisconsin have returned to pre-pandemic levels. And major economic development projects are moving full steam ahead. (inaudible), the Gummy Beer Company is now recruiting workers at its brand new campus in Pleasant Prairie. Komatsu has begun relocating employees to its new state-of-the-art Milwaukee campus. Milwaukee Tools, Downtown office tower is set to begin operations this month, and we see more growth ahead. For example, ABB, a global industrial and technology company; and Saputo, a leading dairy products company have announced plans for major expansions in our region. And finally, you've heard the phrase are rising tide lift all boats. Well, I'm pleased to report that 1 of the most celebrated luxury boat makers in the world, Grand craft boats, is relocating its operations from Michigan to the Milwaukee region. You know, J. Lo, George Clooney, Robert Redford, they're among the high-profile clients of Grand Craft. So it will be interesting to see who shows up below deck at our next Analyst Day.\nBottom line, we remain optimistic about the strength of the regional economy and our outlook for long-term growth. With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott for more details on our utility operations and our Infrastructure segment. Scott, all yours.\n\nScott J. Lauber\n\nPresident, CEO, President of We Energies & Director, WEC Energy Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, Gale. Looking back, we made significant progress in 2021. I'll start by covering some developments in Wisconsin. As Gale mentioned, we're continuing to make progress on the transition of our generation fleet and our ESG progress plan. I am pleased to report that our Badger Hollow One solar project is now providing energy to our customers. You'll recall that we own 100 megawatts of this project in Southwest Wisconsin. We have also made progress on the construction of Badger Hollow II. Currently, we expect an in-service state in the first quarter of 2023. This factors in a delay of approximately 3 months due to ongoing supply chain constraints. We do not expect a material change in the construction costs. In addition, the Public Service Commission has approved our plans to build 2 liquified natural gas storage facilities in the southeastern part of the state. Construction has started and we plan to bring the facilities into service in late 2023 and mid-2024.\nWe expect this project to save our customers approximately $200 million over time and help ensure reliability during Wisconsin's coldest winters. And we recently signed our first contract for renewable natural gas or RNG, for our gas distribution business. We'll be tapping into the output of one of our large local dairy farms. The gas applied each year will directly replace higher emission methane from natural gas that would have entered our pipes. This 1 contract alone represents 25% of our 2030 goal for methane reduction. The Wisconsin-based company, U.S. game, is planning to have RNG flowing to our distribution network by the end of this year. The commission also approved the development of Red Barn, a wind farm in Southwestern part of the state. We expect our Wisconsin Public Service utility to invest approximately $150 million in this project and for it to qualify for production tax credits.\nWhen complete, it will provide WPS with 82 megawatts of renewable capacity. And just this past Monday, we filed an application with the commission for approval to acquire a portion of the capacity from West Riverside Energy Center. West Riverside is a combined cycle natural gas plant owned by Alliant Energy. If approved, Wisconsin Public Service would acquire 100 megawatts for approximately $91 million. That's the first of 2 potential option exercises. We expect the transaction to close in the second quarter of 2023. Looking forward, we expect to file a rate review for our Wisconsin utilities by May. We have no other rate cases planned at this time.\nTurning now to our Infrastructure segment. The 190-megawatt Jayhawk wind farm located in Kansas, began service in December. We invested approximately $300 million in this project. Overall, we have brought 6 projects online in our Infrastructure segment, representing more than 1,000 megawatts of capacity. And as you'll recall, we expect the Thunderhead Wind farm to come online for the second quarter and the sapphire sky by the end of this year. Including these 2 projects, we plan to invest a total of $1.9 billion in this segment over the next 5 years, and we remain ahead of plan. And with that, I'll turn things back to Gale.\n\nGale E. Klappa\n\nExecutive Chairman, WEC Energy Group, Inc.\n\nScott, thanks so much. We're confident that we can deliver our earnings guidance for 2022. We're guiding, as you know, in a range of $4.29 a share to $4.33 a share. The midpoint $4.31 represents growth of 7.5% from the midpoint of our original guidance last year. And you may have seen the announcement that our Board of Directors, at its January meeting, raised our quarterly cash dividend by 7.4%. We believe this increase will rank in the top decile of our industry. This also marks the 19th consecutive year that our company will reward shareholders with higher dividends. We continue to target a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings. We're right in the middle of that range now. So I expect our dividend growth will continue to be in line with the growth in our earnings per share.\nNext up, Xia will provide you with more detail on our financial results and our first quarter guidance. Xia?\n\nXia Liu\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, CenterPoint Energy, Inc.\n\nThanks, Gale. Turning now to earnings. Our 2021 results of $4.11 per share increased $0.32 or 8.4% compared to 2020. Our earnings package includes a comparison of 2021 results on Page 17. I'll walk through the significant drivers.\nStarting with our utility operations, we grew our earnings by $0.10 compared to 2020. First, weather added $0.04 mostly driven by colder winter weather conditions compared to 2020. Second, continued economic recovery drove a $0.09 increase in earnings. This reflected stronger weather normalized electric sales as well as the resumption of late payment and other charges.\nLet me give you some highlights on our weather-normalized retail sales. Overall, retail delivery of electricity, excluding the iron ore mine, were up 2.6% compared to 2020. We saw a continued economic rebound in 2021 in our service territories. Small commercial and industrial electric sales were up 4.4% from 2020, and large commercial and industrial sales, excluding the iron ore mine, were up 5.1%. Natural gas deliveries in Wisconsin were relatively flat excluding gas used for power generation.\nLastly, rate relief and additional capital investment contributed $0.14 to earnings and lower day-to-day O&M drove a $0.03 improvement. These favorable factors were partially offset by $0.17 of higher depreciation and amortization expense and a net $0.03 reduction from fuel costs and other items. Overall, we added $0.10 year-over-year from utility operations.\nEarnings from our investment in American Transmission Company decreased $0.02 per share year-over-year. The positive impact of additional capital investment was more than offset by 2 factors: a 2020 (inaudible) quarter that benefited 2020 earnings and an impairment that we booked in the fourth quarter of 2021 on an investment outside of the ATC service territory. This substantially wrote off all of the goodwill on the project. Earnings at our Energy Infrastructure segment improved $0.06 in 2021.\nThis was mostly related to production tax credit from the Blooming Grove and Tatanka Ridge wind farms. Finally, we saw an $0.18 improvement in the Corporate and Other segment. Lower interest expense contributed $0.07 year-over-year. Also, we recognized a $0.04 gain from our investment in the fund devoted to clean energy infrastructure and technology development. The remaining positive variance related to improved (inaudible) Trust performance and some favorable tax and other items.\nIn summary, we improved on our 2020 earnings by $0.32 per share. Looking now at the cash flow statement on Page 6. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $163 million. The increase in cash earnings was more than offset by working capital requirements, mostly related to higher natural gas prices. As we resume normal collection practices in the spring, we expect working capital to improve throughout the year. Total capital expenditures and asset acquisitions were $2.4 billion in 2021. This represents a $471 million decrease compared to 2020 due primarily to the timing of the in-service date of Thunderhead Wind Farm.\nTurning now to financing activities. We opportunistically refinanced over $450 million of holding company debt during the fourth quarter. This reduced the average interest rate of these notes from 4.5% to 2.2%. We continue to demonstrate our commitment to strong credit quality. Adjusting for the impact of voluntary pension contribution and the year-over-year increase in working capital, our FFO to debt was 15.7% in 2021.\nFinally, let's look at our guidance for sales and earnings. For weather-normalized sales in Wisconsin, we're expecting 0.5% growth this year in both our electric and natural gas businesses, continued growth after a very strong year. In terms of 2022 earnings guidance, last year, we earned $1.61 per share in the first quarter. We project first quarter 2022 earnings to be in the range of $1.68 per share to $1.70 per share.\nThis forecast assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter. And as Gale stated, for the full year 2022, we are reaffirming our annual guidance of $4.29 to $4.33 per share.\nWith that, I'll turn it back to Gale.\n\nGale E. Klappa\n\nExecutive Chairman, WEC Energy Group, Inc.\n\nXia, thank you so much. Overall, we're on track and focused on providing value for our customers and our stockholders. Operator, we're now ready to open it up for the question-and-answer portion of the call."

This call is being recorded for rebroadcast. After the presentation, the conference will be open to analysts for questions and answers. In conjunction with this call, a package of detailed financial information is posted at wecenergygroup.com.

During the discussions, referenced earnings per share will be based on diluted earnings per share, unless otherwise noted. And now it is my pleasure to introduce Gale Klappa, Executive Chairman of WEC Energy Group.\n\nGale E. Klappa\n\nnullExecutive Chairman\n\nLive from the [indiscernible]. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today as we review our results for the first quarter of 2024. First, I'd like to introduce the members of our management team who are here with me today. We have Scott Lauber, our President and Chief Executive; Xia Liu, our Chief Financial Officer; and Beth Straka, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations.\nNow as you saw from our news release this morning, we reported first quarter 2024 earnings of $1.97 a share. Throughout the warmest winter in Wisconsin history, we remain laser-focused on financial discipline, operating efficiency and customer satisfaction and we're confident that we can deliver another year of strong results in line with our guidance for 2024. As a reminder, we're guiding to a range of $4.80 to $4.90 a share for the full year. This, of course, assumes normal weather as always going forward.\nSwitching gears now. We're off to a strong start moving forward with our ESG progress plan. It's the largest 5-year investment plan in our history, totaling $23.7 billion for efficiency, sustainability and growth. As we've discussed, the plan is based on projects that are low risk and highly executable. In the past few weeks alone, we filed with the Wisconsin Commission more than $2 billion of projects that are needed to meet customer demand across the region. In addition, just a few days ago, we announced that we plan to purchase a 90% ownership interest in the [ Delila 1 ] solar project. [ Delila ] is a 300-megawatt solar park in Northeast Texas. It will be the next addition to our WEC Infrastructure segment. We expect to close on [ Delala ] with an investment of $459 million when the project goes into service, and that's currently expected by the end of June.\nSince the beginning of the year, we also purchased an additional 10% interest in the Samson Solar project, now that's part of the Samson and [ Delala ] development in Northeast Texas. And we plan to increase our ownership in the Maple Flats Solar Energy Center from 80% to 90%. And just as a reminder, Maple Flats is under development in South Central Illinois. It has an offtake agreement with a Fortune 100 company for all the energy it will produce. The project should be in service by the end of this year.\nSo to sum it up, with [ Delila ] with the increase in ownership of Samson and Maple Flats, we'll be investing an additional $560 million this year in our Infrastructure segment. As you recall, we're reallocating away from our operations in Illinois a total of $800 million over the 5-year period 2024 through 2028. These high-quality 0 carbon projects clearly go a long way toward achieving that goal. And each of these projects meets our strict financial criteria.\nOverall, the building blocks of our capital plan show even stronger growth in our regulated electric business. And our plan fully supports our long-term earnings growth rate which we project to be in the 6.5% to 7% range on a compound average annual basis.\nAnd now turning to the regional economy. The unemployment rate in Wisconsin stands at 3% continuing a long-running trend below the national average. In fact, Wisconsin recently reached a new record for employment, more people working than at any other time in state history and that includes a record folks for the number of construction jobs. That's a great sign of the growth and the potential we're seeing, particularly in what we call the [ I-94 ] corridor.\nTo give you just one example of the new economic activity in the region. Just a few weeks ago, electronic components that are used in fiber broadband networks began rolling off the assembly line at a state-of-the-art facility developed by [ Sanmina ] Corporation. These components help form the backbone for high-speed Internet service.\nAnd we want to welcome [ Eli ] Lilly to our neighborhood. The Pharmaceutical giant is purchasing a new production facility, again, in the I-94 corridor. And speaking of growth, Microsoft is moving full speed ahead on the construction of a massive data center complex in the I-94 corridor south of Milwaukee. In fact, in the next few weeks, Microsoft is planning an event here in the Milwaukee area to discuss its plans for new investments in Wisconsin. So stay tuned.\nAnd looking broadly across the landscape, I can tell you that the number of prospects looking at expanding or locating in the Milwaukee 7 region is stronger literally than at any time in the past 2 decades. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Scott for more specifics on our regulatory calendar, our capital plan and our operational highlights. Scott, all yours.\n\nScott J. Lauber\n\nnullSenior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer\n\nThank you, Gale. I'd like to start with some updates on the regulatory front. In Wisconsin, we filed new rate reviews for test years 2025 and 2026 on April 12. Our request focus on addressing 3 major areas of need. First, improving reliability and reducing outages from increased storm activity; second, supporting Wisconsin's economic growth and job creation through investments in new generation and distribution projects; and lastly, complying with the new EPA mission rules by continuing the transition from coal generation, renewables and natural gas.\nWe expect the decision by the end of the year with new rates effective January 1, 2025. Last month, we submitted filings to the Wisconsin Commission for significant developments to support our electric generation business. Our proposed projects include 2 new sources of natural gas generation. The first request is for approval to construct 1,100 megawatts of modern [ sipulcycle ] combustion turbines at our existing Oak Creek power plant site. The expected investment is $1.2 billion.\nTo support that generation, we are proposing to build a 33-mile lateral with an expected investment of approximately $180 million. This lateral would provide firm reliability of natural gas to the Oak Creek site for those units as well as our [ Power the Future ] units that we're converting to natural gas. And to help to share reliability, we are proposing a new storage facility at Oak Creek, with a planned investment of approximately $460 million. This facility would have the capacity to store 2 billion cubic feet a liquefied natural gas to support both our generation and our gas distribution system.\nIn addition, we requested approval to add 128 megawatts of state-of-the-art generation using reciprocating internal combustion engines, or as we call them, race units. We expect to invest approximately $280 million in that project near our Paris Generation Station. As a reminder, these investments are expected to earn AFUDC during the construction period.\nWe also have smaller rate reviews in progress at our 2 Michigan utilities. Michigan Gas Utilities and Upper Michigan Energy Resources. These applications are primarily driven by our capital investments supporting reliability and safety. And you recall our discussion last quarter on the recent developments in Illinois. There are 3 dockets we're actively engaged in at this time.\nFirst, the Illinois Commission granted us a limited rehearing focused on the request to restore $145 million for the safety modernization program in 2024. This mostly relates to emergency work, work that was in progress and work driven by public entities like the City of Chicago. This limited rehearing is now underway, and we expect to receive a final commission order by June 1.\nThe other 2 outstanding dockets are expected to span at least a year, and we are actively involved. One is a full review of the safety modernization program and the other is an evaluation of the future of gas in Illinois. Of course, we'll keep you updated on any further developments.\nNow turning to our capital plan. We're making good progress on a number of regulated projects in support of affordable, reliable and clean energy. Our Zona LNG storage facility is now in service, this additional 1 Bcf of storage will be necessary during the extreme weather events we see here in Wisconsin. Also, the Wisconsin Commission has approved our purchase of 100 megawatts of additional capacity at West Riverside Energy Center. We expect to invest approximately $100 million to add this capacity to our electric business in the second quarter.\nAt the same time, we're continuing the efforts to phase out older, less efficient coal generation. In fact, I'm happy to report that we're on track to retire Unit 5 and 6 of our Oak Creek power plant later this month. These changes support our goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It's a busy and strong start to the year. Our capital plan is robust and highly executable, and we continue to focus on the fundamentals of our business. With that, I'll turn things back to Gale.\n\nGale E. Klappa\n\nnullExecutive Chairman\n\nScott, thank you very much. Now as you may recall, our Board of Directors at its January meeting raised our quarterly cash dividend by 7%. This marks, ladies and gentlemen, the 21st consecutive year that our company will reward shareholders with higher dividends. The increase is consistent with our policy of paying out 65% to 70% of our earnings in dividends and underscores our confidence in delivering a bright, sustainable future. Next up, Xia will provide us with more details on our financial results for the quarter and our guidance for Q #2. Xia?\n\nXia Liu\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Gale. Our 2024 1st quarter earnings of $1.97 per share increased $0.36 per share compared to the first quarter of 2023. Our earnings package includes a comparison of first quarter results on Page 12. I'll walk through the significant drivers.\nStarting with our utility operations. Our earnings were $0.28 higher compared to the first quarter of 2023. Weather had an estimated $0.07 negative impact quarter-over-quarter. As noted earlier, this past winter was the warmest in Wisconsin history. The milder weather, along with $0.09 from higher depreciation and amortization, interest expense and day-to-day O&M expense were more than offset by the following positive variances.\nTiming of fuel expense was a $0.09 increase quarter-over-quarter. Our fuel was in a positive recovery position at the end of Q1 this year, compared to an under-recovered position at the end of Q1 last year. And rate base growth contributed $0.35 to earnings quarter-over-quarter. This includes the rate increases from Wisconsin, Illinois and Michigan.\nOne thing to note, as I mentioned on our year-end call, with the rate design changes at Peoples Gas, base revenues are even more concentrated in the first and fourth quarters when natural gas usage is the highest and this earnings shift is a significant driver for the quarter. Looking ahead, we'll see the opposite shift in Q2 and Q3.\nBefore I turn to earnings at the Other segment, let me briefly discuss our weather normal sales. You can find our sales information on Page 9 of the earnings package. While weather was historically mild in the quarter, our weather-normal gas and electric deliveries were both relatively flat and overall in line with our forecast. However, on the electric side, our residential and small commercial and industrial segments are currently ahead of forecast.\nNow at our Energy Infrastructure segment, earnings increased $0.02 in the first quarter of '24 compared to the first quarter of '23. Production tax credits were higher quarter-over-quarter resulting from production at our Samsung and Sapphire Sky renewable generation projects, both of which were acquired in February 2023. Finally, you'll see that earnings at our Corporate and Other segment rose $0.06, primarily driven by timing of tax.\nIn closing, as Gale mentioned earlier, we are reaffirming our 24 earnings guidance of $4.80 to $4.90 per share, assuming normal weather for the rest of the year. To offset the mild first quarter weather impact, we're implementing a variety of initiatives. For example, we now expect our '24 day-to-day O&M to be 3% to 5% higher than '23 versus our previous expectation of 6% to 7% higher. The lion's share of the reduction is expected to come in the second half of the year.\nFor the second quarter, we're expecting a range of $0.60 to $0.64 per share. This accounts for April weather and assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter. As a reminder, we earned $0.92 per share in the second quarter last year. While the Q2 guidance range is lower, if you combine Q1 actual and Q2 guidance, we expect to be $0.04 to $0.08 ahead of the first quarter of '23. With that, I'll turn it back to Gale.\n\nGale E. Klappa\n\nnullExecutive Chairman\n\nGreat. Thank you, Xia. And now a final note. We did some quick math this morning. In today marks the 87th time that I've had the privilege of hosting an analyst call, starting back in the day at Brand X and then continuing through the past 21 years here at WEC. Together, we've covered a lot of history and a ton of progress.\nI can tell you that your thoughtful questions and your thorough analysis have helped us to build and sustain a premier company on a mission that truly matters. And for that, I'm grateful. Going forward on these calls, you'll be hearing from Scott and Xia, they are ready, and it's their time to shine. And operator, we're now ready for the question-and-answer portion of the call."

Lauber\n\nnullSenior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer\n\nGood afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today as we review our results for the second quarter of 2024. Here with me today are Xia Lu, our Chief Financial Officer; and Beth Straka, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. As you saw from our news release this morning, we reported second quarter 2024 earnings of $0.67 per share.\nWe're firmly on track to meet the full year 2024 guidance of $4.80 to $4.90 a share. This, of course, assumes normal weather for the balance of the year. We continue to see strong foundational growth in our regional economy. The unemployment rate in Wisconsin stands at 2.9%, continuing a long-running trend below the national average. The pipeline of economic activity is particularly strong in what we call the I-94 corridor between Milwaukee and Chicago.\nFor example, just last month, WestRock broke ground on a new facility at the former site of our retired power plants. WestRock is a leading company in paper and packaging solutions with 50,000 employees and 300 plants worldwide. The company called the cutting-edge facility, a super plant, stating it will be one of their largest and most advanced plants. And Microsoft is making good progress on the construction of a large data center complex in Southeast Wisconsin.\nIn May, Microsoft announced a broad investment package to strengthen our region as a hub for AI economic activity, innovation and job creation. These investments include a planned $3.3 billion to be spent in cloud computing and AI infrastructure between now and the end of 2026. Microsoft has stated that it expects to bring 2,300 construction jobs to the area by 2025 and 2,000 permanent jobs over time.\nThese developments highlight the strength and the potential of our local economy and underscores the need for the investments in our capital plan. During the second quarter, we continued to move forward on major projects in our capital plan. It's the largest 5-year investment plan in our history totaling $23.7 billion for efficiency, sustainability and growth.\nAs we've discussed, the plan is based on projects that are low risk and highly executable. At the end of May, we closed on our second option at West Riverside Energy Center for $100 million. This adds 100 megawatts of efficient combined cycle natural gas generation to our portfolio. You'll recall that last year, we discussed several filings or last quarter, we discussed several filings for major projects to support economic growth and reliability in Wisconsin.\nThis includes approximately 1,200 megawatts of efficient natural gas generation at our Paris and Oak Creek sites, as well as 2 billion cubic foot liquified natural gas storage facility and a 33-mile gas lateral to serve Oak Creek site. In total, these projects combined represent $2.1 billion of investment. Our proposals were submitted to the Wisconsin Commission in April, and we expect the decision in approximately a year. Also under review, we filed an application in February to purchase a 90% ownership interest in high noon solar energy center in Southern Wisconsin.\nWith an expected investment of approximately $580 million the facility is expected to provide 300 megawatts of solar generation. We have asked the commission to make a decision before the end of the year. As a reminder, we expect these investments to earn AFUDC during the construction period after commission approval. And in our WEC Infrastructure segment, the Delilah One Solar project is now expected to go into service at the end of the year, delayed from June due to a weather event.\nWe plan to invest approximately $460 million for a 90% ownership interest in this project in Northeast Texas, and we still expect our Maple Flak Solar Project to be in service by the end of the year. As you recall, we're investing an additional $560 million this year in our Infrastructure segment. We reallocated away from our operations in Illinois a total of $800 million in our 5-year capital plan.\nOverall, our plan fully supports our long-term earnings growth rate which we project to be in the 6.5% to 7% range on a compound average annual basis. We're also on schedule with the development of our next 5-year plan. And as usual, we expect to share the details with you in the fall. Now I have a few updates on the regulatory front. In Wisconsin, we filed new rate reviews for test year 2025 and 2026 on April 12.\nOur request focused on addressing 3 major areas of need. First, improving reliability and reducing outages from increased storm activity, second, supporting Wisconsin's economic growth and job creation through investments in new generation and distribution projects; and lastly, continue the transition from coal generation to renewables and natural gas.\nCommission staff and intervener testimony is scheduled for August 21, we expect the decision by the end of the year with new rates effective January 1, 2025. We have smaller rate reviews and progress at Michigan Gas Utilities and Upper Michigan Energy Resources. We also expect decisions on these reviews by the end of the year. And in Illinois, we've been engaged in 3 dockets. The Illinois Commerce Commission issued its decision on the first of these, a limited rehearing of the commission's rate order for Peoples Gas at the end of May.\nThe commission had agreed to reconsider our request to restore $145 million for safety modernization program in 2024. This is mostly related to emergency work unfinished projects and work driven by public entities like the city of Chicago. The commission granted $28.5 billion concentrating on what they deemed emergency work. We have appealed this decision to the Illinois Appellate Court along with other items in the rate order, including the commission's previous disallowance of investments in new service centers.\nWe are also actively involved in 2 remaining dockets. One is the review of the safety modernization program, staff and intervener rebuttal testimony are expected by August 21, and with a commission decision expected in the first quarter of 2025. The other docket is the evaluation of the future of natural gas in Illinois, which is expected to conclude in about a year.\nOf course, we'll keep you updated on any further developments. Across our business, we continue to make good progress towards our goals of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In May, we retired units 5 and 6 at our Oak Creek power plant. Together, those made up over 500 megawatts of coal-fired generation. Including these units since 2018, we've retired nearly 2,500 megawatts of older fossil fuel generation.\nFinally, a quick reminder about the dividend. We continue to target a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings. We're tracking in that range now and expect the dividend growth will continue to be in line with the growth of our earnings per share. Now I'll turn it to Xia to provide you more details on our financial results and our guidance for the third quarter.\n\nXia Liu\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Scott. We earned $0.67 a share for the second quarter. While this was a decrease of $0.25 quarter-over-quarter, we exceeded our Q4 guidance -- Q2 guidance range of $0.60 to $0.64 a share driven by favorable O&M and financing compared to guidance. As Scott indicated, we are on track to meet our 2024 earnings guidance. As I reminded you on the last couple of calls with the redesign changes at Peoples Gas, base revenues are now more concentrated in the first and 4 quarters when natural gas usage is the highest.\nThis earnings shift has impacted our second quarter and will impact our Q3 guidance, which I will discuss in a few minutes. Now let's look at our quarter-over-quarter variances. Our earnings package includes a comparison of second quarter results on Page 15. I'll walk through the significant drivers. Starting with our utility operations, earnings were $0.19 lower compared to the second quarter of 2023 as a result of higher O&M, fuel, depreciation and amortization, interest and other expenses.\nA couple of drivers for the day-to-day O&M variants are worth noting. One, we experienced higher storm costs in the current quarter compared to Q2 last year. And two, we benefited in Q2 last year from a land sale at a retired plant site in Wisconsin. Looking ahead, I now expect overall day-to-day O&M in 2024 to be 2% to 3% higher compared to 2023. This is a 4% improvement compared to our initial expectation due to our continued O&M savings initiatives that we expect to realize late this year.\nThe impact of weather was flat for the quarter. Compared to normal conditions, we estimate that weather had a $0.02 negative impact for the second quarter in both 2023 and 2024. Our [indiscernible] electric sales in Wisconsin are relatively flat quarter-over-quarter and are overall in line with our forecast.\nLooking at ATC, continued capital investments contributed an incremental $0.01 to Q2 earnings compared to 2023. And in our Energy Infrastructure segment, earnings improved $0.02 in the second quarter of 24% compared to the second quarter of '23, driven partially by higher production tax credit at WEC infrastructure. Finally, you'll see that earnings at our Corporate and Other segment decreased $0.09 as a result of the impact of tax timing and higher interest expense.\nNow turning to guidance. For the third quarter, we are expecting a range of $0.68 to $0.70 per share. This accounts for July weather and assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter. As I mentioned earlier, it also accounts for the shift in Illinois revenue recognition pattern. Our third quarter 2023 earnings were $1 a share. Once again, we are reaffirming our 2024 earnings guidance of $4.80 to $4.90 per share, assuming normal weather for the rest of the year.\nBefore I turn back to Scott, let me quickly remind you that we continue to utilize dividend reinvestment and employee benefit plans to issue common equity. Also, as we said before, we plan to set up an ATM program. Overall, we still project that our common equity issuance will be up to $200 million for 2024.\nPost 2024, our equity issuances will be tied to our capital spending ratably with approximately $500 million expected per year in the current plan. We look forward to updating you in the fall as we refresh our capital and financing plan. With that, I'll turn it back to Scott.\n\nScott J. Lauber\n\nnullSenior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer\n\nThank you, Xia. Overall, we're on track and focused on providing value for our customers and our stockholders. Operator, we're ready now for the question-and-answer portion of the call."

This call is being recorded for rebroadcast. [Operator Instructions]\nBefore the conference call begins, I remind you that all statements in the presentation, other than historical facts, are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that are subject to change at any time. Such statements are based on management's expectations at the time they are made. In addition to the assumptions and other factors referred to in connection with the statements, factors described in WEC Energy Group's latest Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated.\nDuring the discussions, referenced earnings per share will be based on diluted earnings per share, unless otherwise noted. After the presentation, the conference will be open to analysts for questions and answers. In conjunction with this call, a package of detailed financial information is posted at wecenergygroup.com. A replay will be available approximately 2 hours after the conclusion of this call.\nAnd now it's my pleasure to introduce Gale Klappa, Executive Chairman of WEC Energy Group.\n\nGale E. Klappa\n\nnullExecutive Chairman\n\nThank you very much. Live from the [ Heartland ]. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today as we review our results for the first quarter of 2023.\nFirst, I'd like to introduce the members of our management team who are here with me today. We have Scott Lauber, our President and Chief Executive; Xia Liu, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Beth Straka, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations.\nNow as you saw from our news release this morning, we reported first quarter 2023 earnings of $1.61 a share. Weather was a major factor in our lower results for the quarter. We saw one of the mildest winters in the history of the Upper Midwest. For example, it was the second warmest first quarter in Milwaukee since 1891, However, we're confident in our plan for the remainder of the year and we're reaffirming our guidance for 2023. As a reminder, we're guiding to a range of $4.58 to $4.62 a share for the full year. This assumes normal weather going forward. And as always, we remain focused on the fundamentals of our business, financial discipline, operating efficiency and customer satisfaction.\nSwitching gears now. The work on our ESG progress plan continues at a steady pace. It's the largest 5-year investment plan in our history, totaling $20.1 billion for efficiency, sustainability and growth. The plan is based on projects that are low risk and highly executable. And as we look to the future, it's clear that the mega trend of decarbonization and the need for even greater reliability will drive investment plans that are long and strong. Scott will provide you with more detail on several specific projects in a moment. But I'm pleased to report that just since last December, the Wisconsin Commission has approved more than $1 billion of new capital investment by our companies.\nAs we've discussed, we project that our ESG progress plan will drive compound earnings growth of 6.5% to 7% a year from 2023 through 2027. We and we fully expect to fund our capital plan without any need for new equity.\nNow let's take a brief look at the regional economy. We have good news from the latest data in Wisconsin. In March, the unemployment rate came in at 2.5%. That's a record low for the state and well below the national average and we continue to see major developments in the area. Just a few weeks ago, in fact, Microsoft announced that it plans to create a new data center campus in our region with an initial investment of $1 billion. This data center complex will be built south of Milwaukee in the technology park that is also being developed by Foxconn. Microsoft will purchase a 315-acre parcel in Area 3 of the park. Local approvals have been received, and we expect Microsoft to close on the land purchase on or before the 31st of July.\nIn the meantime, Microsoft is moving full speed ahead with planning and design work. The decision by Microsoft underscores the strength and the potential of the Wisconsin economy and positions us very well for more growth in the technology sector.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Scott for more information on our regulatory developments, our operations and our infrastructure segment. Scott, all yours.\n\nScott J. Lauber\n\nnullSenior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer\n\nThank you, Gale. I'd like to start with a few updates on the regulatory front.\nNew rates have been in effect for our Wisconsin utilities since the start of the year. As expected, we're planning to file a limited reopener for 2024 later this quarter. The filing will address the recovery of capital investments for projects going into service this year and in 2024. The return on equity and the equity layer are all set and are not up for consideration, the request will be quite modest, and we expect a decision from the commission by the end of this year.\nAnd as you recall, we have rate filings under review in Illinois for Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas. The next step will be for the commission staff and interveners to file their direct testimony on May 9. Hearings are scheduled for early August. After 9 years without a rate case at Peoples Gas, who are making these requests for 2024 to support our investment in key infrastructure and with lower natural gas prices, we project customer bills will be flat with 2022.\nWe also have rate reviews in progress at Minnesota Energy Resources and Michigan Gas Utilities. We filed in Minnesota last November and interim rates went into effect January 1. I'm pleased to announce that we received a settlement with parties that would result in a 7.1% increase in base rates. That's based on a 9.65% return on equity with an equity layer of 53%. This settlement is subject to commission approval, which we expect in the next several months.\nAnd in March, we filed for a base rate increase of 9.1% at Michigan Gas Utilities for 2024. This application is primarily driven by our capital investments supporting safety and reliability.\nMeanwhile, we're making good progress on a number of regulatory capital projects. Red Barn Wind Park went to service last month. The project is providing 82 megawatts of clean energy capacity to our Wisconsin customers. And as Gale noted, we received 3 significant approvals for the Wisconsin Commission since last December for the Dairy and Solar Battery Park, West Riverside Energy Center and [ Koshkonong Solar Battery Parks ]. We discussed the Dairy and approval last quarter. And as you recall, the solar park is planned to go in service in 2024.\nWest Riverside is a combined cycle natural gas plant owned by Alliant Energy. In February, we received approval for our purchase of 100 megawatts of Riverside capacity for approximately $102 million. We expect to close this purchase by the end of the month. We have an option to purchase another 100 megawatts of Riverside capacity, and we plan to exercise that option later this year.\nWe also received approval for our purchase of Koshkonong Solar Battery Park with plans for 300 megawatts of solar capacity and 165 megawatts of battery storage. We will own 90% of the project with an expected investment of $585 million. We project the solar portion of this facility to go into service in 2025.\nWe also continue on the Badger Hollow II solar facility and the Paris Solar-Battery Park. While Badger Hollow has received some of the solar panels, the remaining panels for projects are currently in Chicago going through the customs process. Assuming timing release of the panels, we expect these solar parts to go into service late this year or early next year.\nFor the Paris and Koshkonong projects, we're evaluating the timing of the battery investments. Of course, we'll keep you updated on any future developments.\nOutside of utilities, we continue to make progress on zero carbon projects in our WEC Infrastructure segment. In February, we completed our acquisition of the Sapphire Sky Wind Farm, now in service in Illinois. As a reminder, that project offers 250 megawatts of capacity in total, and we own a 90% share. Also in February, we added an 80% ownership in the Samson 1 Solar Project located in Northeast Texas. The project has a capacity of 250 megawatts. As disclosed previously, Samson 1 suffered storm damage at the beginning of March, but we expect no significant bottom line impact for the property losses. The project is currently producing energy at about 70% level and improving every day as we continue to restore the site.\nWith that, I'll turn things back to Gale.\n\nGale E. Klappa\n\nnullExecutive Chairman\n\nScott, thank you very much.\nNow as you may recall, our Board of Directors at its January meeting raised our quarterly cash dividend by 7.2%. This marks the 20th consecutive year that our company will reward shareholders with higher dividends. We continue to target a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings. We're right in the middle of that range now, so I expect our dividend growth will continue to be in line with the growth in our earnings per share.\nNext up, Xia will provide you with more details on our financial results and our second quarter guidance. Xia?\n\nXia Liu\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Gale. Our 2023 first quarter earnings of $1.61 per share decreased $0.18 per share compared to the first quarter of 2022. Our earnings package include the comparison of first quarter results on Page 12. I'll walk through the significant drivers.\nStarting with our utility operations, our earnings were $0.09 lower compared to the first quarter of '22. Rate-based growth contributed $0.22 to earnings, driven by continued investment in our ESG progress plan. This includes the base rate increase for our Wisconsin utilities as well as the interim rate increase for Minnesota Energy Resources, both of which were effective January 1, 2023. This favorable margin impact from rate base growth was more than offset by a number of factors.\nFirst, as Gale noted, we experienced one of the mildest winters in history which drove a $0.12 decrease in earnings compared to the first quarter of last year. Additionally, timing of fuel expense, depreciation and amortization interest, day-to-day O&M, taxes and other drove a combined $0.19 negative variance.\nBefore I turn to earnings at the other segments, let me briefly discuss our weather-normalized sales. You can find our sales information on Page 9 of the earnings package. I'd like to remind you that weather normalization is not a perfect science, extreme warm weather in the first quarter may not be fully reflected in our weather-normalized data. Having said that, Weather-normal retail natural gas deliveries in Wisconsin, excluding natural gas used for power generation, were down 1%. However, residential usage, again on a weather-normal basis, grew 0.9%. That was ahead of our forecast. Weather-normal retail electric deliveries, excluding the iron ore mine, were 1.9% lower. Residential usage was relatively flat compared to last year.\nNow at our Energy Infrastructure segment, Earnings were $0.01 lower in the first quarter of '23 compared to the first quarter of '22. Production tax credits were higher by $0.03 quarter-over-quarter resulting from acquisitions of renewable generation projects. This increase was largely offset by a pickup that we recorded in the first quarter last year from the resolution of market settlement in the Southwest Power Pool.\nFinally, you'll see that earnings at our Corporate and Other segment decreased $0.08 primarily driven by an increase in interest expense and a pickup recorded in the first quarter '22 from our investment in a clean energy fund. These items were partially offset by favorable rabbi buy trust performance and some tax and other items. Remember, rabbi trust performance is largely offset in O&M.\nLooking now at the cash flow statement on Page 6 of the earnings package. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $281 million. The mild winter and timing of recovery of commodity costs contributed to this decrease. Total capital expenditures and asset acquisitions were $1.3 billion in the first quarter of '23, and $884 million increase from the first quarter of '22. This was primarily driven by the acquisition of the whitewater natural gas power generation facility in our Wisconsin segment, as well as the Sapphire Sky Wind Farm and Samson 1 solar facility in our Infrastructure segment.\nIn closing, as Gale mentioned earlier, we are reaffirming our 2023 earnings guidance of $4.58 to $4.62 per share, assuming normal weather for the rest of the year. To offset the mild first quarter weather impact, we are implementing a variety of initiatives. As a result, we now expect our day-to-day O&M to be 2% to 3% higher than 2022 versus our previous expectation of 3% to 5% higher.\nI will also add that largely due to timing of O&M and fuel expense, we expect earnings in the second half of this year to be materially better than the second half of 2022. For the second quarter, we're expecting a range of $0.83 to $0.85 per share. This accounts for April weather and assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter. As a reminder, we earned $0.91 per share in the second quarter last year.\nWith that, I'll turn it back to Gale.\n\nGale E. Klappa\n\nnullExecutive Chairman\n\nXia, thank you. Overall, we're on track and focused on providing value for our customers and our stockholders.\nOperator, we're ready now for the Q&A portion of the call."

Klappa\n\nnullExecutive Chairman\n\nFrom Americas Heartland, good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today as we review our results for the third quarter of 2023. First, I'd like to introduce the members of our management team who are here with me today. We have Scott Lauber, our President and Chief Executive; Xia Lu, our Chief Financial Officer; and Beth Straka, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations.\nAs you saw from our news release this morning, we reported third quarter 2023 earnings of $1 a share. We delivered another solid quarter of growth, and we remain on track for a strong 2023. Our focus on executing the fundamentals of our business is creating real value for our customers and our stockholders.\nToday, we're also reaffirming our earnings guidance for the year. The range is $4.56 to -- I'm sorry, $4.58 to $4.62 a share with an expectation of completing the year in the upper half of the range. As always, this assumes normal weather through the final quarter of 2023.\nSwitching gears now, our big news for the day is the rollout of our ESG progress plan for the period 2024 through 2028. As you may have seen from our announcement this morning, we expect to invest $23.4 billion with an ongoing focus on efficiency, sustainability and growth. This is the largest capital plan in our history, an increase of $3.3 billion above our previous 5-year plan. That's more than a 16% increase. Several factors are driving the investment outlined in our updated ESG progress plan. The first of these factors is the economic growth we're seeing in the Milwaukee region, particularly in what we call the I-94 corridor in the southeastern part of the state, between Milwaukee and the Illinois State line. From data centers to pharmaceuticals to microinverters for solar panels, from even more gummy bears to massive new distribution and fulfillment centers. And this growth is also spanning new commercial and residential development in the region.\nIn our new 5-year plan, we expect our asset base to grow at an average rate of 8.1% a year. And as we fund this growth with an appropriate financing package, we project our earnings per share will continue to rise at a compound annual rate of 6.5% to 7% a year. As we've been discussing with you, our plan will include growth equity in the form of programmatic equity, including our dividend reinvestment plan, employee benefit plans and at the market plans. There is no need for block equity in the 5-year plan, and we'll start in 2024 by issuing $100 million to $200 million of new equity. Xia will provide you with more details on the financing plan in just a few minutes.\nI'd also like to point out a few other quick highlights for you. Over the next 5 years, we'll continue to make great progress in transforming our power generation fleet and reducing carbon dioxide emissions. In the plan, for example, we're making a significant commitment to new solar, wind and battery storage as well as modern efficient natural gas generation and LNG storage. In addition, we'll be adapting to the new seasonal capacity rules being put in place by MISO, mid-continent independent system operator. American Transmission Company will be adding needed transmission capability and to help assure energy security for our customers will continue to harden our distribution networks. On the environmental front, our plan still calls for reducing CO2 emissions from our power generation fleet by 80% by the end of 2030. And I'm pleased to report that assuming timely regulatory approvals, we now project a complete exit from coal 3 years earlier by the end of 2032. So the future is bright. The investment opportunity is long, strong and highly executable, and Scott will provide you with some specifics in just a few minutes.\nAnd now a brief look at the regional economy. The unemployment rate in Wisconsin stands at 3.1% continuing a long-running trend below the national average. And as we look inside the numbers, we see an encouraging upward trend in Wisconsin's labor force participation of this year. As I mentioned, growing companies are investing and expanding in our region. Microsoft is now moving dirt and moving full speed ahead to develop its new data center complex in that I-94 corridor we mentioned south of Milwaukee. And [ Arbo ] officially opened the doors of its new confectionery plant in July. Fast forward to today, and [ Inherabo ] is already planning to double the size of its production capability, adding more capacity for gummy bears, new technology and additional employees. And also south of Milwaukee, [ Uli ], plans to open a 1 million square foot facility this year, [ Uline ] in case you're not familiar with the name, is the leading distributor of shipping, industrial and packaging materials for businesses throughout North America and even more expansion land by [ Uline ] for 2025.\nThese developments highlight the strength and the potential of the Wisconsin economy and underscore the need for the investments we're outlining in our 5-year plan.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Scott for more specifics on our capital projects, our regulatory calendar and our operational highlights. Scott, all yours.\n\nScott J. Lauber\n\nnullSenior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer\n\nThank you, Gale. I'd like to start with some of the specifics on our capital plan. As Gale noted, we have identified $3.3 billion of additional investments compared to our last 5-year plan. I'll walk you through the changes. Between 2024 and 2028, we plan to increase our investment in renewables by $1.4 billion. With that, we expect to invest in 3,800 megawatts of new renewable capacity.\nIn the plan is a $1 billion increase in Transmission investment. This is our share of the ATC plan. Renewable projects and regional growth are among the driving factors. To support reliable service for our customers, we expect to spend an additional $1.3 billion on natural gas generation over the 5-year plan. This includes both combustion turbines and reciprocating internal combustion engines or rice units. We also have planned to invest an additional $800 million in liquefied natural gas capacity which will be used for electric generation and for natural gas operations on the coldest days of the year. With these important investments for our utilities, we have reduced our planned investment in our Energy Infrastructure segment. We'll be happy to share more details with you at the upcoming EEI conference.\nNow moving on to the regulatory front. As you recall, we expect a decision from the Wisconsin Commission before the end of the year under limited reopener filings. We also have an update on our rate filings under review in Illinois for Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas. Recently, the administrative law judge and the case issued a proposed order largely consistent with staff's recommendation. The order recommends a 9.83% return on equity at both utilities, and we expect a final decision by the end of November.\nAnd moving to the other states, I'm pleased to report that both the Minnesota and Michigan commissions have recently approved settlements on our rate reviews. Meanwhile, we're making progress on a number of regulated capital projects. As you recall, we closed on our first option at the West Riverside Energy Center earlier this year adding 100 megawatts of efficient combined cycle natural gas generation to our portfolio. Since our last call, we filed a request to purchase another 100 megawatts of Riverside capacity under our remaining option. Pending regulatory approval, we expect to invest $100 million to add this capacity in 2024.\nElsewhere in the state, work continues on the Badger Hollow II solar facility and the [ Parisiarian ] solar battery parks. You may recall, we had solar panels waiting on final release from a bonded warehouse in Chicago. I'm happy to report that those panels are being cleared. The first 100 megawatts have been released and the trucks are rolling to our Badger Hollow II site. We expect all of our panels to be released and in our position by the end of this year. We are on track for Badger Hollow II to go into service late this year or early next year with the Paris Solar Park to follow. In addition, work is underway on the Dairy and solar facility, which is planned to go into service by the end of 2024. We'll keep you updated on any future developments.\nWith that, I'll turn things back to Gale.\n\nGale E. Klappa\n\nnullExecutive Chairman\n\nScott, thanks very much. And now just a quick reminder about our dividend. Our dividend growth continues to stand in the top decile of our industry. In fact, we were recently named 1 of the 10 best dividend stocks in America by Morningstar. As usual, I expect our Board will assess our dividend plans for next year and our regularly scheduled meeting in December. We continue to target a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings. We're positioned well within that range now, so I expect our dividend growth will continue to be in line with the growth in our earnings per share.\nNext up, Xia will provide you with more information on our third quarter financials and a good bit of detail on our upcoming 5-year financing plan. Xia, all yours.\n\nXia Liu\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThanks, Gale. Our 2023 third quarter earnings of $1 per share increased $0.04 per share compared to the third quarter of 2022. Our earnings package includes a comparison of third quarter results on Page 15. I'll walk through the significant drivers. Our earnings from utility operations were $0.18 above the third quarter of 2022. First, weather had an estimated $0.01 negative impact quarter-over-quarter. Higher depreciation and amortization expense and interest expense added another $0.09 of negative variance. These unfavorable variances were more than offset in the quarter. Rate-based growth contributed $0.13 to earnings. This includes the base rate increase for our Wisconsin utilities as well as the interim rate increase for Minnesota Energy Resources.\nAdditionally, timing of fuel expense improved our earnings by $0.13 and lower day-to-day O&M resulted in a $0.02 improvement. Before I turn to earnings at the Other segment, let me briefly discuss our weather-normalized sales for the quarter. You can find this sales information on Page 11 of the earnings package. Retail electric deliveries in Wisconsin, excluding the iron ore mine, were down 0.8% quarter-over-quarter. This was driven by lower sales volumes to large commercial and industrial customers. Residential usage was up 1.3% and is ahead of our forecast through the first 9 months of the year. Also, sales to our small commercial and industrial customers were up [ 14% ] and are tracking our forecast for the year.\nRegarding our investment in American Transmission Company, earnings decreased $0.05 compared to the third quarter of 2022. Recall that last year, we recorded a $0.05 pickup from a resolution of MISO ROE appeals. Earnings at our Energy Infrastructure segment decreased $0.01 in the third quarter of 2023 compared to the third quarter of 2022. This was mostly driven by lower wind production partially offset by tax credits from projects that we placed into service.\nFinally, you'll see that earnings at our Corporate and Other segment decreased $0.08 largely due to higher interest expense. As Gale noted, we are reaffirming our annual guidance of $4.58 to $4.62 per share. This includes October weather and assumes normal weather for the remainder of the year.\nNow turning to our financing plan. Gale and Scott have already discussed the new 5-year capital plan. I'll provide details related to our anticipated financing activities to support the plan. You can find this information on Page 22 of the earnings package. As you can see on the chart, over the next 5 years, we expect cash from operations to fund about 65% of our cash needs. About 28% of the funding is expected to come from debt and the remaining 7% from issuance of common equity. As Gale mentioned earlier, we expect to utilize dividend reinvestment and employee benefit plans and asset market programs to tap into the equity market. Our common equity issuance is projected to be in the range of $100 million to $200 million for 2024 and $1.8 billion to $2.2 billion over the next 5-year plan.\nRecall, our equity ratios in our utilities are sicker, particularly at Wisconsin Electric. Supporting these sicker equity layers results in approximately $400 million of common equity raise. The remaining equity raise represents approximately 50% of incremental capital spend. As you know, our equity issuances post 2024 will be tied to our capital plan ratably at approximately $450 million a year. This financing plan not only supports our long-term earnings growth rate, but also helps maintain our targeted credit metrics.\nIn addition, I'll quickly address our upcoming holding company refinancing needs. Over the next 3 years, we have total maturities of about $2.8 billion. The $600 million that matures in 2024 carries a very low coupon. However, the remaining $2.2 billion scheduled to mature in 2026 has a weighted average coupon of just under 5%, which represents lower refinancing risk.\nIn closing, as shown on the last page of the earnings package, through our capital allocation, we expect the percent of assets invested in our regulated electric businesses to grow faster. At the same time, the percent of assets in gas distribution and in contracted renewables is expected to decline. We are very excited about the investment opportunities ahead of us.\nWith that, I'll turn it back to Gale.\n\nGale E. Klappa\n\nnullExecutive Chairman\n\nAll right, Xia, thank you very much. Overall, we're on track and the company continues to perform at a very high level. Operator, we're ready now for the question-and-answer portion of the call."

This call is being recorded for rebroadcast, and all participants are in a listen-only mode at this time.\nBefore the conference call begins, I remind you that all statements in the presentation, other than historical facts, are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that are subject to change at any time. Such statements are based on management's expectations at the time they are made. In addition to the assumptions and other factors referred to in connection with the statements, factors described in WEC Energy Group's latest Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated.\nDuring the discussions, referenced earnings per share will be based on diluted earnings per share, unless otherwise noted. After the presentation, the conference will be open to analysts for questions and answers. In conjunction with this call, a package of detailed financial information is posted at wecenergygroup.com. A replay will be available approximately 2 hours after the conclusion of this call.\nAnd now it's my pleasure to introduce Gale Klappa, Executive Chairman of WEC Energy Group.\n\nGale E. Klappa\n\nnullExecutive Chairman\n\nWell, good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today as we review our results for the second quarter of 2023.\nFirst, I'd like to introduce the members of our management team who are here with me today. We have Scott Lauber, our President and Chief Executive; Xia Lu, our Chief Financial Officer; and Beth Straka, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations.\nAs you saw from our news release this morning, we reported second quarter 2023 earnings of $0.92 a share. After a down first quarter marked by 1 of the warmest winters on record, we delivered solid results in the second quarter and we're firmly on track for a strong 2023. Today, we're reaffirming our guidance for the year. The range is $4.58 to $4.62 a share. This, of course, assumes normal weather going forward.\nAs always, we're focused on the fundamentals of our business: Financial discipline, operating efficiency and customer satisfaction. During the second quarter, we also continued to move forward on our major initiatives, including the investments outlined in our $20.1 billion ESG progress plan. As we've discussed, the plan is based on projects that are low risk and highly executable. We expect to quadruple the amount of renewable generation for our regulated customers, add highly efficient gas field capacity to ensure reliability and continue to harden our delivery networks. Scott will provide you with more detail on several specific projects in just a moment.\nAs a reminder, we project that our ESG progress plan will drive growth in earnings per share of 6.5% to 7% a year. And as we've discussed, there is no need to issue equity for this $20.1 billion 5-year plan.\nNow over the past few months, many of you have asked about the trajectory of our next 5-year plan. Our updated plan will cover the period 2024 through 2028. Of course, if growth in demand for capacity and energy drives our next capital plan significantly higher, then we'll evaluate all our financing options. In addition to incremental debt and refinancing opportunities, our options could include accessing the equity market through our dividend reinvestment plans, employee benefit plans and at-the-market programs. I would stress that at this point, we do not see the need for any block equity offering.\nAgain, as a reminder, any equity need would be driven by growth and would support our long-term growth projections. As you would expect, we're on schedule with the development of our next 5-year plan, and as usual, we'll share the details with you in the fall.\nNow let's take a brief look, we'll switch gears and take a brief look at our regional economy. We're still seeing a very strong labor market in Wisconsin. In June, the state added 7,000 private sector jobs. The unemployment rate came in at 2.5%, well below the national average, and the labor force participation rate rose for the fourth straight month in Wisconsin to 65.3%. Very solid numbers.\nWe're also encouraged by the pipeline of economic activity in our region. Last quarter, you heard that Microsoft plans to make an initial investment of $1 billion to create a new data center campus. This new complex will be built south of Milwaukee, in the Wisconsin Innovation Park where [ Foxconn ] is located. Microsoft has purchased 315 acres in Area 3 of the park and is moving full speed ahead. In fact, earthwork at the site began just a few days ago. So along with American Transmission Company, we're working closely, in fact, on a weekly basis with Microsoft to determine the full extent of the energy infrastructure that will be needed to serve this development. We're excited about supporting Microsoft as the company moves forward with a major technology investment, and we'll update you as the planning proceeds.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Scott for more information on our regulatory developments and on our operations. Scott, all yours.\n\nScott J. Lauber\n\nnullSenior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer\n\nThank you, Gale.\nI'd like to start with a few updates on the regulatory front. In May, we filed a limited reopener to set 2024 rates for our Wisconsin utilities. The filings address the recovery of capital investments for certain projects going into service this year and in 2024. These are renewable facilities, rice generation and LNG reliability investments. The projects have already been approved by the Wisconsin Commission. The return on equity and the equity layer are all set and are not up for consideration as part of this proceeding. We expect a decision from the commission by the end of this year.\nAnd as you recall, we have rate filings under review in Illinois for Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas. After 9 years without a base rate case at Peoples Gas, we're making these requests for 2024 to support our investments in critical infrastructure. In mid-July, the staff filed its [ rebump ] testimony, recommending a 9.83% return on equity and an equity layer of 50.83% for Peoples Gas. This was consistent with the initial recommendations from the staff. We expect a final decision by the end of the year.\nAnd moving to the other states, we are very pleased that we have reached a settlement agreement in our rate reviews at both Minnesota Energy Resources and Michigan Gas Utilities. The Minnesota Commission is considering a settlement that would provide a 7.1% increase in base rates. As a quick reminder, that's based on a 9.65% return on equity with an equity layer of 53%. And we're pleased to update you that in Michigan, we have reached a unanimous settlement, and the details will be made public later this week. We expect final commission approval by the end of the year.\nMeanwhile, we're continuing progress on a number of regulatory -- regulated capital projects. At the beginning of June, we closed on our first option of West Riverside Energy Center for $95 million. This adds 100-megawatt of efficient and combined cycle natural gas generation to our portfolio. As you recall, this plant is in operation and the purchase price was based on book value. And in the next few weeks, we plan to file a request to purchase another 100 megawatts of Riverside capacity under our remaining option.\nWe also put 128 megawatts of new natural gas generation online last month. As you recall, we invested $170 million to build this generation at our existing Weston power plant site in Northern Wisconsin. The facility uses 7 reciprocating internal combustion engines, or as we call them, RICE units. Elsewhere in the state, work continues on the Badger Hollow II solar facility and the Paris and Darien Solar Battery Parks. The Badger Hollow II site has begun receiving panels using non-Chinese polysilicon. Also, we continue to work on securing custom release of panels from a bonded warehouse in Chicago, and we're still expecting Badger Hollow II to go into service late this year or early next year, with Paris Solar Park to follow. In addition, work has begun on the Darien solar facility, which is planned to go into service in 2024. We'll keep you posted and update on future developments.\nWith that, I'll turn you back to Gale.\n\nGale E. Klappa\n\nnullExecutive Chairman\n\nScott, thanks very much.\nAs you may recall, our Board of Directors at its January meeting raised our quarterly cash dividend by 7.2%. We believe this continues to rack our dividend growth in the top decile of our industry. We're targeting a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings. We're right in the middle of that range now, so I expect our dividend growth will continue to be in line with the growth in our earnings per share.\nNext up, Xia will provide you with more detail on our financial results and unveil our third quarter guidance. Xia, all yours.\n\nXia Liu\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThanks, Gale.\nOur 2023 2nd quarter earnings of $0.92 per share increased $0.01 per share compared to the second quarter of 2022. Our earnings package includes a [ consolidation ] of second quarter results on Page 15. I'll walk through the significant drivers.\nOur earnings from utility operations were $0.04 above the second quarter of 2022. First, weather had an estimated $0.05 negative impact quarter-over-quarter. Higher depreciation and amortization expense and interest expense added another $0.09 of negative variance. These negative variances were more than offset in the quarter. [ Rates-based ] growth contributed $0.11 to earnings. This includes the base rate increase for our Wisconsin utilities as well as the interim rate increase for Minnesota Energy Resources, both of which were effective January 1, 2023. Additionally, timing of fuel expense improved our earnings by $0.05, and lower day-to-day O&M taxes and other items resulted in a $0.02 improvement.\nBefore I turn to earnings at the other segment, let me briefly discuss our weather-normalized sales for the quarter. You can find this sales information on Page 11 of the earnings package. Retail electric deliveries in WIsconsin, excluding the iron ore mine, was down 0.6% on a weather-normal basis. This was driven by lower sales volumes to large commercial and industrial customers. Residential usage, again, on a weather-normal basis was flat quarter-over-quarter, which is in line with our forecast. Also, sales to our small commercial and industrial customers were up 1.4%, which is ahead of forecast.\nEarnings at our Energy Infrastructure segment improved $0.02 in the second quarter of '23 compared to the second quarter of '22. This was largely driven by higher production tax credits as a result of the acquisition of renewable projects.\nFinally, you'll see that earnings at our Corporate and Other segment decreased $0.05, primarily driven by an increase in interest expense. This was partially offset by favorable rabbi trust performance and some tax and other items. Remember, rabbi trust performance is largely offset in O&M.\nOverall, we improved on our second quarter performance by $0.01 per share compared to last year and by $0.08 per share compared to the midpoint of our Q2 guidance.\nLooking now at the cash flow statement on Page 6 of the earnings package. Net cash provided by operating activities was relatively flat compared to the prior year, and total capital expenditures and asset acquisitions were $2.1 billion during the first half of 2023, an increase of more than $1 billion from the first half of 2022. This was primarily driven by acquisitions of generation projects in our regulated and infrastructure segment.\nNow, let me give you the guidance for the third quarter. We're expecting a range of $0.88 to $0.90 per share. This accounts for July weather and assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter. As a reminder, we earned $0.96 per share in the third quarter last year, which included a positive $0.02 from weather and a $0.05 pickup related to the resolution of a MISO ROE complaint. As Gale mentioned earlier, we are reaffirming our 2023 earnings guidance of $4.58 to $4.62 per share, assuming normal weather for the rest of the year. As a reminder, largely due to timing of O&M and fuel expense, we expect earnings in Q4 to be materially better than Q4 of 2022.\nWith that, I'll turn it back to Gale.\n\nGale E. Klappa\n\nnullExecutive Chairman\n\nGreat, Xia. Thank you.\nOverall, we're on track and focused on providing value for our customers and our stockholders. And operator, we're ready now for the question-and-answer portion of the call."

Klappa\n\nExecutive Chairman of the Board, WEC Energy Group, Inc.\n\nFrom the home of the Defending MMA Champion, Milwaukee Bucks, good afternoon, everybody, and thank you for joining us today as we review our results for the first quarter of 2022. First, I'd like to introduce the members of our management team who are here with me today. We have Scott Lauber, our President and Chief Executive; Xia Liu, our Chief Financial Officer; and Beth Straka, Senior Vice President, Corporate Communications and Investor Relations.\nNow as you saw from our news release this morning, we reported first quarter 2022 earnings of $1.79 a share. Our results were largely driven by colder-than-normal weather, a strong economy and the performance of our Infrastructure segment. In light of this strong start to the year, we're raising our earnings guidance by $0.05 a share for 2022 to a range of $4.34 to $4.38 a share with an expectation of reaching the top end of this new range. This, of course, assumes normal weather for the remainder of 2022. Our balance sheet and cash flows remain strong. And as we discussed, this allows us to fund a highly executable capital plan without issuing equity.\nWe're also making good headway on our $17.7 billion ESG progress plan, the largest 5-year capital plan in the company history. The plan is focused on efficiency, sustainability and growth. Over the past few months, we've received regulatory approval for more than $1.1 billion of needed capital projects in Wisconsin. Scott will provide more detail in just a few minutes. And we're preparing the way for further progress ahead.\nAs you may have seen, our Wisconsin utilities filed rate reviews with the Public Service Commission for the 2-year period in 2023 and 2024. We provided you with details in the earnings packet that we released this morning, and Scott will cover the highlights in just a moment. But the request, ladies and gentlemen, is all about the investments we need to make to enhance reliability for customers and continue the largest clean energy transition in our history. I would add that even with this request, the typical electric bill for our residential customers will remain below the national average.\nSwitching gears now, many of you have asked about the solar panel investigation by the Department of Commerce. There clearly will be impacts across the industry. And at our companies, we may see some price increases and potential delays, particularly on the solar and battery projects that are still going through the regulatory approval process in Wisconsin. But the important point is that we do not expect the review by the Department of Commerce to have any material impact on our 5-year capital plan.\nIn summary, we're poised to continue our strong track record, delivering among the best risk-adjusted returns our industry has to offer. We expect our ESG progress plan to support average growth in our asset base of 7% a year driving earnings growth, dividend growth and dramatically improved environmental performance.\nAcross our generating fleet, we're targeting a 60% reduction in carbon emissions by the end of 2025 and an 80% reduction by the year of 2030, both from a 2005 baseline. By the end of 2030, we expect our use of coal for power generation will be immaterial, and we're aiming for a complete exit from coal by the end of year 2035. Our capital investments fully support this transition. Of course, for the longer term, we remain focused on the goal of net-zero carbon emissions from power generation on 2050.\nWe're also investing in our natural gas distribution business and developing sources of renewable natural gas. Our plan is to achieve net-zero methane emissions by the end of 2030. With those goals in mind, we're working to help shape the future of clean energy.\nHydrogen, for example, could be a key part of the solution in the decades ahead. So earlier this year, as you recall, we announced one of the first hydrogen power pilot programs of its kind in the United States. We're joining with the Electric Power Research Institute to test hydrogen as a fuel source at one of our natural gas-powered units in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Engineering specifications and testing protocols are now being developed, and we're on track for actual blending of hydrogen in the unit this fall. We look forward to sharing results across the industry.\nAnd now let's take a brief look at the regional economy. The latest available data show Wisconsin's unemployment rate at 2.8%, of course, well below the national average. The state's economy recovered throughout 2021 with especially strong growth in the manufacturing sector, and we continue to see major investments from growing companies in our region. For example, Amazon is expanding its presence in Southeastern Wisconsin with plans to lease a 1 million square foot building that is now under development. This expansion could add 400 new jobs to Amazon's workforce, a workforce that is already 3,000 strong in the region.\nUline's workforce is also on the rise. Uline, as you may know, is one of the nation's largest suppliers of packaging and shipping materials. 700 employees joined Uline's workforce in Wisconsin last year, and Uline expects to add 300 more jobs this year. So we remain optimistic about not only the strength but the trajectory of the regional economy.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Scott for more information on our utility operations and our Infrastructure segment as well. Scott, all yours.\n\nScott J. Lauber\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, WEC Energy Group, Inc.\n\nAs Gale mentioned, across Wisconsin, we're making good progress on the transition of our generation fleet and our ESG progress plan. Work continues on our Badger Hollow II solar facility in the southwestern part of the state. We have a plan for delivery and acceptance of the panels, and we expect clearance from customs in a reasonable time frame, so we still project Badger Hollow II to be in service in the first half of 2023.\nAnd recently, the Wisconsin Public Service Commission approved our purchase of 90% of the Paris Solar-Battery Park. It's the largest investment of its kind in Wisconsin history. Located South of Milwaukee, this facility will host 200 megawatts of solar generation and 110 megawatts of battery storage, providing our customers with sunshine after sunset.\nRegarding the solar panels, we have a line of sight on production and delivery, and we still project commercial operation by mid-2023. The situation with battery production and delivery is more fluid, and we work with -- and we'll work through the details. We'll provide you with more information about potential delays in the battery installation of the Paris facility. And of course, we'll continue to examine our capacity situation in light of these developments. To put all this in perspective, it's worth noting that only 3% of our 5-year capital plan is devoted to renewables and battery storage in 2023.\nTurning to other important projects. The commission has approved our plans to build 128 megawatts of natural gas generation at our existing Weston power plant site in Northern Wisconsin. The new facility will use 7 reciprocating internal combustion engines, or as we call them, RICE units. These dispatchable units will support the retirement of older, less efficient coal generation. We expect this project to go into service in 2023.\nAs Gale noted, WEC Infrastructure was a positive driver for the quarter with the addition of Jayhawk, which entered commercial operation in mid-December. Thunderhead will be the next wind farm to go into service, and we now expect that in the fall of this year. As discussed before, we remain ahead of schedule in our 5-year capital investment plan for our Infrastructure business.\nTurning to gas distribution. Just last week, we signed another contract to use renewable natural gas, or RNG, from a local dairy farm. This new agreement brings us halfway to our net-zero methane goal for the end of 2030.\nNow I'll touch on the rate filings Gale mentioned. On April 28, we filed a rate review with the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin. Our proposed plans would help us to continue to reduce emissions, strengthen key infrastructure and provide affordable power to customers. I'll discuss the request to set rates for We Energies and Wisconsin Public Service. You can refer to Pages 14 and 15 of the earnings packet for more details.\nUnder our plans for the 2 utilities, the typical electric bill for residential customers would increase approximately $5 to $6 a month in 2023 or roughly 5% to 6%. Key drivers for our proposed increase include capital investments in renewables, battery storage, natural gas generation and LNG storage for our gas distribution system. Many of these projects have already been approved.\nIn addition, we are introducing grid hardening projects that are part of a 10-year plan to protect our system against severe weather. And the rate review includes other costs that have been authorized to recover in previous proceedings. In summary, this represents only the second time in 8 years we have asked for a base rate increase for We Energies. We expect final orders by the end of the year with new rates effective in January 2023. We have no other regulatory reviews pending across our companies.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it back to Gale.\n\nGale E. Klappa\n\nExecutive Chairman of the Board, WEC Energy Group, Inc.\n\nScott, thank you very much. As you may recall, our Board of Directors, at its January meeting, raised our quarterly cash dividend by 7.4%. We believe this increase will rank in the top decile of our industry. We continue to target a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings. We're right in the middle of that range now, so I expect our dividend growth will continue to be in line with the growth in earnings per share. And today, we're reaffirming our projection of long-term earnings growth at 6% to 7% a year. Again, we do not see any need to issue new equity.\nNext up, Xia will provide more details on our first quarter numbers and our second quarter guidance. Xia, all yours.\n\nXia Liu\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, CenterPoint Energy, Inc.\n\nThanks, Gale. Our 2022 first quarter earnings of $1.79 per share increased $0.18 per share compared to the first quarter of 2021. Our earnings package includes a comparison of first quarter results on Page 13. I'll walk through the significant drivers.\nStarting with our utility operations, we grew our earnings by $0.13 compared to the first quarter of '21. First, rate base growth contributed $0.13 to earnings. As we continued to execute on our ESG progress plan, we grew our utility rate base by over 7% last year.\nNext, colder winter weather conditions drove a $0.05 increase in earnings when compared to the first quarter of last year. Also, continued economic recovery added $0.01, reflecting stronger weather normalized sales during the quarter. Overall, we saw a continued economic rebound in the first quarter of 2022.\nWeather normalized retail natural gas deliveries in Wisconsin, excluding gas used for power generation, were up 3.6% compared to the first quarter of '21. Residential natural gas sales were up 1.6% from the first quarter of '21, and commercial and industrial natural gas sales were up 6.8%. Additionally, weather normalized retail deliveries of electricity, excluding the iron ore mine, were up 0.7% compared to the first quarter of '21. These positive drivers were partially offset by $0.04 of higher depreciation and amortization expense and a $0.01 increase each in day-to-day O&M and fuel. Overall, we added $0.13 quarter-over-quarter from utility operations.\nEarnings at our Energy Infrastructure segment improved $0.06 in the first quarter of '22 compared to the first quarter of '21. Higher production tax credits, driven by strong wind production, added $0.03 in earnings. We also recognized a $0.03 earnings contribution in Q1 this year from the final resolution of market settlements in the Southwest Power Pool that were related to Storm [Erie].\nFinally, you'll see that earnings in our Corporate and Other segment decreased $0.01 when compared to the first quarter of '21. Unfavorable rabbi trust performance resulted in a $0.02 earnings reduction, this was partially offset by a pickup of $0.01 from our investment in Clean Energy Fund. In summary, we improved on our first quarter '21 performance by $0.18 per share.\nLooking now at the cash flow statement on Page 6 of the earnings package. Net cash provided by operating activities increased $682 million. Cash earnings and recovery of commodity costs contributed to this increase.\nTotal capital expenditures and asset acquisitions were $384 million in the first quarter of '22, a $207 million decrease from 2021. This was primarily driven by spending on Jayhawk Wind Farm.\nIn closing, before I turn it back to Gale, I'd like to provide our guidance for the second quarter. For the quarter, we're expecting a range of $0.82 to $0.84 per share. This accounts for April weather and assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter. As a reminder, we earned $0.87 per share in the second quarter last year, which included an estimated $0.03 from favorable weather.\nAnd as Gale mentioned earlier, we're raising our 2022 earnings guidance to a range of $4.34 to $4.38 per share, with an expectation of reaching the top end of the new range. With that, I'll turn it back to Gale.\n\nGale E. Klappa\n\nExecutive Chairman of the Board, WEC Energy Group, Inc.\n\nXia, thank you. Overall, we're on track and focused on delivering value for our customers and our stockholders. Operator, we're now ready to open it up for the Q&A portion of the call."

This call is being recorded for rebroadcast. (Operator Instructions)\nBefore the conference call begins, I remind you that all statements in the presentation, other than historical facts are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that are subject to change at any time. Such statements are based on management's expectations at the time they are made. In addition to the assumptions and other factors referred to in connection with the statements, factors described in WEC Energy Group's latest Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated.\nDuring the discussions, referenced earnings per share will be based on diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted. After the presentation, the conference will be open to analysts for questions and answers. In conjunction with this call, a package of detailed financial information is posted at wecenergygroup.com. A replay will be available approximately 2 hours after the conclusion of this call.\nAnd now it's my pleasure to introduce Gale Klappa, Executive Chairman of WEC Energy Group.\n\nGale E. Klappa\n\nExecutive Chairman of the Board, WEC Energy Group, Inc.\n\nGood afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today as we review our results for calendar year 2022. First, I'd like to introduce the members of our management team, who are here with me today. We have Scott Lauber, our President and Chief Executive; Xia Liu, our Chief Financial Officer; and Beth Straka, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations.\nNow as you saw from our news release this morning, we reported full year 2022 earnings of $4.45 a share. Xia will provide you with more detail on our financial metrics in just a few minutes, but I'm pleased to report to you that we delivered an exceptional year on virtually every meaningful measure, from employee safety and customer satisfaction to growth in earnings per share. Three major factors really shaped our strong results for 2022. Favorable weather, solid performance from our infrastructure and transmission segments, and steady execution of our capital plan as we pave the way for an energy future that's affordable, reliable and clean.\nOn the regulatory front, as you may know, we saw balanced and credit supportive results from our Wisconsin rate reviews in December despite a little bit of noise in the process. New rates are now in effect for all of our Wisconsin utilities. And last month, on January 6, we filed rate requests with the Illinois Commerce Commission for our gas utilities in Illinois. I would point out that home heating bills in Chicago are currently below those of other major U.S. cities like New York, Boston, Baltimore and Philadelphia. And we expect that to continue with this filing. Scott will provide you with more detail in just a moment.\nTurning now to our ESG progress plan that we updated for you in November. It's the largest 5-year investment plan in our history totaling $20.1 billion for efficiency, sustainability and growth. We expect the plan to drive compound earnings growth of 6.5% to 7% a year over the period 2023 through 2027. A key part of the plan is a major commitment to renewable projects, both in our regulated business and in our infrastructure segment.\nIn fact, earlier this week, we announced that our infrastructure group will acquire an 80% ownership interest in Phase 1 of the Samson Solar Energy Center. Located in Northeast Texas, Samson 1 has a capacity of 250 megawatts. It entered commercial service in May of last year and has a long-term power purchase agreement with AT&T. Pending final regulatory approval, we plan to invest approximately $250 million for our portion of Samson 1. We expect to close the transaction late in the first quarter of this year. Samson 1, as you may know, is the first of 5 phases being developed by Invenergy. Overall, Samson is the largest solar project under construction in the United States today, and we're pleased to take part in Phase 1.\nNow as you know, one of our goals is to help shape the future of clean energy. And today, we're announcing an important pilot project with the Electric Power Research Institute and a company called CMBlu Energy. CMBlu is a German designer of long-duration battery storage, using common, low-cost, environmentally friendly materials. In simple English, it's a green battery. This 1 to 2-megawatt hour pilot project will be one of the first of its kind on the United States electric grid.\nOur plan is to test the durability of this battery system. We believe it can store energy for up to twice as long as the typical batteries in use today. We plan to launch the project at our Valley Power Plant near downtown Milwaukee in the fourth quarter of this year when temperatures turn cold. The results will be shared in early 2024 across the industry.\nAnd now let's switch gears and take a brief look at the regional economy. Wisconsin added 52,000 private sector jobs in 2022. And in December, the unemployment rate in the state dropped to 3.2%. That's well below the national average. We believe the current strength and remarkable diversity of the Wisconsin economy positions us well as we move forward in 2023.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Scott for more information on our regulatory developments, our operations and our infrastructure segment. Scott, all yours.\n\nScott J. Lauber\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, WEC Energy Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, Gale. I'd like to start with some updates on the regulatory front. First, let's review where we stand for the Wisconsin Public Service Commission's written orders this past December. The commission authorized a return on equity of 9.8% and for all our Wisconsin utilities. It approved an increase in the equity component of our capital structure to 53%. We will also continue the earnings sharing mechanism to provide benefits to Wisconsin customers if our performance achieved our forecasts. And as Gale mentioned, we now have rate filings under review in Illinois for Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas.\nAt Peoples Gas, we are not seeking an extension of the automatic bill adjustment writer known as QIP, after it expires at the end of this year. We plan to return to the traditional ratemaking process to recover the cost of necessary infrastructure improvements. Our rate request would continue to support those key capital investments.\nPeoples Gas operates one of the oldest natural gas delivery networks in the United States. And as you may recall, an independent engineering study found that over 80% of the iron pipes in the system are approaching the end of their useful life. We are modernizing the system to ensure safety and reliability and to reduce methane emissions. With natural gas prices declining, we project customer bills will remain largely flat as the new rates take effect in 2024.\nYou may also recall, we filed a rate review at one of our smaller utilities, Minnesota Energy Resources last November. We are seeking an overall increase of 8.1%, primarily driven by capital investments. Interim rates went into effect January 1.\nMeanwhile, we're making good progress on a number of our regulatory capital projects. Our Red Barn Wind development is on track to come online within the next few months in Wisconsin with an expected investment of $160 million. This project will provide about 80 megawatts of renewable energy to our system.\nWork continues on the Badger Hollow II solar facility and the Paris Solar-Battery Park. We still expect the solar parks to go into service this year, assuming timely release of the panels. We also received regulatory approval for the -- our purchase of the Darien Solar-Battery Park with plans for 225 megawatts of solar capacity and 68 megawatts of battery storage. We expect this facility to go into service in 2024. Of course, we'll keep you updated on any future developments.\nAnd just last month, with an investment of approximately $75 million, we closed our purchase of the Whitewater combined-cycle plan, a 236-megawatt facility. As a reminder, we previously received energy and capacity for this natural gas unit under a purchase power agreement.\nIn the natural gas business, we have been working to bring high-quality renewable natural gas to our customers. We signed another contract in January, which brings us to a planned total of 1 billion cubic feet of RNG that will enter our system annually. We expect RNG to flow this year, supporting our aggressive goals to reduce methane emissions.\nOutside our utilities, we continue to make good progress on zero-carbon projects in our WEC Infrastructure segment. The Thunderhead Wind farm in Nebraska is now in service. In addition, we expect to complete the acquisition of Sapphire Sky in Illinois in the coming weeks as commercial operations begins. And as Gale noted, we're excited about our plans to add the Samson 1 solar project in our Infrastructure segment before the end of the first quarter.\nAnd with that, I'll turn things back to Gale.\n\nGale E. Klappa\n\nExecutive Chairman of the Board, WEC Energy Group, Inc.\n\nRight, Scott, thank you very much. We're confident that we can deliver on our earnings guidance for 2023. As you recall, we're guiding to a range of $4.58 to $4.62 a share, the midpoint, $4.60 a share represents growth of 6.7% from the midpoint of our original guidance last year. And as we've discussed, we expect to fund our capital plan without any need to issue equity.\nAnd you may have seen the announcement that our Board of Directors at its January meeting, raised our quarterly cash dividend by 7.2%. This marks the 20th consecutive year that our company will reward shareholders with higher dividends. We continue to target a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings. We're right in the middle of that range now, so you can expect our dividend growth will continue to be in line with the growth in our earnings per share.\nNext up, Xia will provide you with more detail on our financial results and our first quarter guidance. Xia all yours.\n\nXia Liu\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, CenterPoint Energy, Inc.\n\nThanks, Gale. Turning now to earnings. Our 2022 earnings of $4.45 per share increased $0.34 per share or 8.3% compared to 2021. Our earnings package includes a comparison of 2022 results on Page 17. I'll walk through the significant drivers.\nStarting with our utility operations, we grew our earnings by $0.19 compared to 2021. Weather drove a $0.04 increase in earnings compared to 2021. Rate-based growth contributed $0.41 to earnings and lower day-to-day O&M expense resulted in a $0.02 improvement and achieved our goal for the year. These favorable factors were partially offset by $0.12 of higher depreciation and amortization expense related to continued capital investment and a $0.12 increase in fuel expense, mainly driven by higher natural gas costs.\nIn terms of sales, on a weather-normalized basis, retail electric deliveries in Wisconsin excluding the iron ore mine, were up 0.1%. Small commercial and industrial sales increased 0.5% while residential and large commercial and industrial sales stayed relatively flat. Overall, our sales mix was stronger than our forecast.\nOur sales projections for 2023 can be found on Pages 13 and 14 of the earnings package. Overall, we are projecting relatively flat electric and gas sales year-over-year. Regarding our investment in American Transmission Company, earnings increased $0.07 compared to 2021. If you recall, $0.05 related to the resolution of historical appeals that we discussed on our third quarter earnings call. As previously discussed, beginning with the third quarter of 2022 and going forward, we are recording ATC earnings at a 10.38% return on equity.\nEarnings at our Energy Infrastructure segment improved $0.14 in 2022 compared to 2021. This was mainly driven by production tax credits as a result of stronger wind production and the addition of our Jayhawk Wind farm that went into commercial operation at the end of 2021. In addition, recall that we recognized a $0.03 earnings contribution earlier in 2022 from the final resolution of market settlements in the Southwest Power Pool.\nFinally, you'll see that earnings at our Corporate and Other segment decreased $0.06, primarily driven by rabbi trust performance and lower gains recognized on our investment in the clean energy fund. Remember, rabbi trust performance is largely offset in O&M. Overall, we improved on our 2021 performance by $0.34 per share.\nLooking now at the cash flow statement on Page 6 of the earnings package. Net cash provided by operating activities increased $28 million. And total capital expenditures and asset acquisitions were $2.7 billion in 2022, a $324 million increase as compared to 2021. As you can see, we have been executing well on our capital plan.\nFinally, let's look at our earnings guidance. In terms of first quarter 2023 earnings guidance, we project to earn in the range of $1.68 per share to $1.72 per share. This forecast takes into account the fourth warmest January on record since the 1880s and assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter. Remember, last year, we earned $1.79 per share in the first quarter, which included $0.02 of favorable weather, $0.03 from the Southwest Power Pool settlement and $0.03 from our investment in a clean energy fund.\nAnd for the full year 2023, we're reaffirming our annual guidance of $4.58 to $4.62 per share. We're also reaffirming our long-term earnings growth of 6.5% to 7% share -- 7% a year over the next 5 years.\nWith that, I'll turn it back to Gale.\n\nGale E. Klappa\n\nExecutive Chairman of the Board, WEC Energy Group, Inc.\n\nXia, thank you. Overall, we're on track and focused on providing value for our customers and our stockholders. Operator, we're ready now for the question-and-answer portion of the call."

The company has provided reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the materials posted on its website for this conference call. And now it is my pleasure to introduce Gale Klappa, Executive Chairman of WEC Energy Group.\n\nGale E. Klappa\n\nnullExecutive Chairman\n\nWell, good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today, as we review our results for calendar year 2023. First, I'd like to introduce the members of our management team, who are here with me today. We have Scott Lauber, our President and Chief Executive; Xia Liu, our Chief Financial Officer; and Beth Straka, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. .\nNow as you saw from our news release this morning, we reported full year 2023 adjusted earnings of $4.63 a share. This excludes a onetime noncash charge of $0.41 a share. You may recall that the Illinois Commerce Commission in November, allowed the construction costs for the modern service centers and facilities that we built in Illinois to improve employee safety and productivity. We firmly believe that the investments were necessary and prudent. And at the appropriate time, we will appeal the decision in court.\nDespite the setback in Illinois, I'm pleased to report that we delivered another year of solid results on virtually every meaningful measure, from customer satisfaction to financial performance, to steady execution of our capital plan. Xia will provide you with more detail on our financial metrics for 2023 in just a few moments.\nTurning to other regulatory matters. The Wisconsin Commission approved our limited reopener filings in December. New rates are now in effect for all of our Wisconsin utilities. And in Illinois, a limited rehearing has been scheduled for a portion of our Safety Modernization Program. As a reminder, the Illinois Commerce Commission ordered a pause in that program for at least 1 year. We've been systematically replacing old leaking cast iron pipes under the streets of Chicago. This long-running project is approximately 38% complete today.\nWe had planned to invest approximately $265 million in these safety upgrades, during 2024. Given the commission's order, we will not be carrying out the program as envisioned. We honestly do not believe that stopping the work is in the best interest of our Chicago customers. But we will have another opportunity to make our case in the coming months through this limited rehearing.\nIn addition, the Illinois Commission will open a new docket this month to examine the future of gas, across the state of Illinois. This review is expected to take at least 1 year to complete. Switching gears now. Let's look at the investment needs of our broader enterprise. We continue to refine our ESG progress plan, our road map, if you will, for the period 2024 through 2028. As you'd expect, we're lowering our planned capital investment in Illinois. But the bigger picture is strong and growing.\nAnd today, we're increasing our 5-year plan by $300 million. What was a $23.4 billion plan, the largest in our company's history, is now a 5-year plan totaling $23.7 billion. The increase is focused on 2 categories, electric distribution to support the strong economic growth we're seeing in Wisconsin and WEC Energy projects that are in our due diligence pipeline. That's our WEC infrastructure projects. In fact, we're in the final stage now of getting another major project for our infrastructure portfolio, a 300-megawatt solar investment for approximately $460 million.\nClosing and Commercial operation could take place in the second quarter of this year. We'll keep you informed. Overall, the building blocks of our updated capital plan clearly support our long-term growth rate. Growth from our 5-year plan on a compound average annual basis, remains in the 6.5% to 7% range. As always, we're starting with the midpoint of our 2023 guidance.\nHowever, we expect earnings for 2024 to come in at or below the current consensus estimate. The reason is simple, as we redeploy capital, at least temporarily away from Illinois, the majority of the quality projects we're investing in, will not be in service for the full year 2024. So for this year, for 2024, we project earnings to be in the range of $4.80 to $4.90 a share, and Xia will provide you with more detail in just a moment or 2.\nOne final but important point about our capital plan. As a percentage of the total enterprise, our regulated Electric business will be larger 5 years from now than it is today. Economic development, reliability and decarbonization are driving that growth. We plan to continue our investment in the infrastructure segment as well. But 5 years from now, we expect the Infrastructure segment will be only 6% of our asset base.\nAnd now turning to the regional economy. The unemployment rate in Wisconsin stands at 3.3%. That continues a long-running trend below the national average. And as we've discussed, we're seeing some really exciting developments here in the state. You've heard about Microsoft's plans in the Wisconsin Innovation Park south of Milwaukee. That investment continues to build. Microsoft has now purchased a total of 1,345 acres of property and construction is already underway on a major data center complex.\nOf course, Microsoft didn't alone, in what we call the I-94 Corridor, companies like HARIBO and Uline are expanding their footprints as well. For example, Uline just announced plans for a third office building in Pleasant Prairie. Uline expects to complete construction by 2025, creating additional space for more than 700 workers. Uline, in case you're not familiar with the name, is the leading distributor of shipping, industrial and packaging materials to businesses throughout North America.\nAnd just last week, WestRock, a Fortune200 company that produces sustainable paper and packaging materials, announced plans to build a 587,000 square foot manufacturing facility on the former site of our Pleasant Prairie Power Plant. These developments highlight the strength and the potential of the Wisconsin economy and underscore the need for the investments we're outlining in our 5-year ESG progress plan. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Scott for more specifics on our regulatory calendar, our capital plan and our operational highlights. Scott, all yours.\n\nScott J. Lauber\n\nnullSenior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer\n\nThank you, Gale. I'd like to start with some more updates on the regulatory front. First, let's review where we stand after the Wisconsin Public Service Commission's written orders this past December. The reopener filings address recovery of capital investments for certain projects going into service in 2023 and also this year. These are renewable facilities, RICE generation and LNG reliability investments.\nThe return on equity and the equity layer were not up for consideration, as part of this proceeding. In the coming months, we plan to file a new rate reviews in Wisconsin for test years 2025 and 2026. You heard from Gale on the latest developments in Illinois. The commission has granted us a limited rehearing focused on our request to rescore $134 million of Safety Modernization Program in 2024. This mostly relates to emergency work, work that is in progress and work driven by public entities like the city of Chicago.\nWe expect the commission to issue an order by June 1. Now turning to our updated capital plan. We have identified $300 million of additional capital investment compared to the initial version of our 5-year plan. I'll walk you through the changes, which are summarized for your reference in the slides we provided for today's call.\nMost notably, we have included several new investments in our Energy Infrastructure portfolio. We're continuing to take advantage of production tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act, while providing solid returns through long-term offtake agreements. We expect these projects to add approximately $800 million to our plant, and we're already on our way. Just last month, we closed on an incremental 10% ownership of the Samson Solar Farm, now in operation in Northern Texas. We now own 90% of the farm for a total investment of $280 million. And as Gale mentioned, we have another major project, solar project in their sites.\nWe also plan to increase investment in Wisconsin by $300 million, to better support economic development and reliability in the state. Offsetting these incremental investments, you will see a $800 million decrease in our planned spending on the Illinois Gas Delivery system over the 5-year period. This is driven by the regulatory order we received in November.\nMeanwhile, we're making good progress on a number of regulated projects in support of affordable, reliable and clean energy. We continue to work toward our ambitious goal for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. At the end of 2023, we achieved a 54% reduction in carbon emissions from electric generation, compared to 2005. That puts us well on our way toward a 80% reduction in target by the end of 2030, as we build our portfolio of low and no carbon generation.\nAnd the progress continues. The final panels of the Badger Hollow Solar Park are now in service, completing the largest solar project in Wisconsin history. As you'll recall, our Wiscansin utilities own a total of 200 megawatts of solar capacity at Badger Hollow. The facility's first phase went online in December 2021 and the second phase wrapped up at the end of 2023. In addition, our Bluff Creek LNG storage facility is now on surface. Liquefied natural gas provides a solution to meet peak customer demand for heating, as well as gas supply needed for power generation. This storage will be necessary during extreme weather events, like we experienced in mid-January.\nI'm also pleased to announce that we have been using renewable natural gas in our distribution system. This replaces a portion of the traditional natural gas we deliver to customers, while contributing to our methane reduction goal. Our latest pilot project with EPRI and CMBlu Energy is also underway. And as you'll recall, this is testing a long-duration battery made with environmentally friendly materials. We look forward to sharing the results across the industry later this year. It's a strong start to the year. Our capital plan is robust and highly executable and we continue to focus on the fundamentals of the business. With that, I'll turn things back to Gale.\n\nGale E. Klappa\n\nnullExecutive Chairman\n\nScott, thank you very much. Now as you may have seen, our Board at this January meeting raised the quarterly dividend to $0.835 a share. That's an increase of $0.05 a share or 7%. This will mark the 21st consecutive year that our shareholders will be rewarded with higher dividends. The increase is consistent with our policy of paying out 65% to 70% of our earnings in dividends and underscores our confidence in delivering a bright, sustainable future.\nOne other quick note on our track record of dividend growth. We learned last week that WEC Energy is being added to S&P's High Dividend Aristocrat Index. This index is made up exclusively of companies that have raised their dividends for at least 20 consecutive years. Next up, Xia will provide you with more detail on our financial results, our financing plan and our 2024 guidance. Xia?\n\nXia Liu\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThanks, Gale. Turning now to earnings. Excluding the $0.41 per share noncash impairment charge in Illinois, our 2023 adjusted earnings per share were $4.63. Our earnings package includes a year-over-year comparison of results on Page 16. I'll walk through the significant drivers.\nStarting with our utility operations. Weather had an estimated 24% negative impact year-over-year. In fact, January, February and December of 2023 were the warmest on record, over the past 133 years. Higher depreciation and amortization expense and interest expense added another $0.33 of negative variance. These unfavorable variances were more than offset during the year.\nRate-based growth contributed $0.75 of positive variance year-over-year. This includes the base rate increase for our Wisconsin and Minnesota utilities, as well as the rate increase for Peoples Gas that was effective December 1, 2023. Additionally, fuel expense improved our earnings by $0.14. Lower day-to-day O&M resulted in a $0.10 improvement and taxes and other items benefited earnings by $0.04.\nRemember, we originally guided our 2023 total company day-to-day O&M to be 3% to 5% higher than 2022. Throughout the year, we were able to manage to a much tighter range. Our actual 2023 total company day-to-day O&M was only [ 0.6% ] higher than 2022.\nTurning now to Sales. You'll see the details on Page 12 of the earnings package. On a weather-normal basis, retail electric deliveries in Wisconsin, excluding the iron ore mine, were down 1% in 2023. The decrease was driven by our large commercial and industrial sales, which were down 3.3%. Meanwhile, Residential and Small Commercial and Industrial sales increased 0.2%, which were ahead of our forecast. Our sales projections for 2024 can be found on Pages 12 and 13 of the earnings package.\nOverall, we're projecting relatively flat Electric sales year-over-year and 0.8% growth in Gas sales year-over-year. Regarding our investment in American Transmission Company, earnings decreased $0.03 compared to 2022. Recall that last year, we reported a $0.05 pickup from a resolution of MISO ROE appeals. This was partially offset by a $0.02 improvement in earnings related to additional capital investment.\nEarnings at our Energy Infrastructure segment improved $0.04 in '23, compared to 2022. This was mainly driven by an increase in production tax credits, Finally, you'll see that earnings at our Corporate and other segment decreased $0.29, primarily driven by an increase in interest expense. Overall, we improved our performance by $0.18 per share on an adjusted basis in 2023.\nNow Gale and Scott have laid out our refreshed 5-year capital plan. In light of the $300 million increase to our capital plan, we have revised our funding plan accordingly. Consistent with our previous message, we're funding this increase with an even split between debt and equity. As you can see on Page 21 of the earnings package, we now expect to issue between $1.95 billion and $2.35 billion of common equity over the next 5 years.\nAs you can see on the chart, over the next 5 years, we expect cash from operations to fund about 64% of our cash needs. About 28% of the funding is expected to come from debt and the remaining 8% from issuance of common equity. We have turned on new equity to satisfy the dividend reinvestment and employee benefit plans, and we also expect to use at-the-market programs. Our common equity issuance is still projected to be in the range of $100 million to $200 million for 2024.\nPost 2024, our equity issuances will be tied to our capital plan, ratably at approximately $500 million a year. Finally, let's look at our earnings guidance. As Gale stated, for the full year 2024, we're providing guidance of $4.80 to $4.90 per share. In developing this guidance range, we took into consideration the expected loss of earnings from lower rate base in Illinois and timing of several projects under development.\nNow let me briefly discuss our day-to-day nonfuel O&M expense expectations. We expect our 2024 O&M to be 6% to 7% higher. Approximately 5% of the increase is driven by assets that were included in recent rate cases, Projects in the Infrastructure segment and extraordinary storm costs in January. The remaining O&M increase of 1% to 2% is largely driven by inflation, offset by operating efficiencies.\nLooking at the bigger picture, our O&M projection for 2024 is well below our actual O&M expenditures 8 years ago in 2016. In terms of first quarter 2024 earnings guidance, we project to earn in the range of $1.96 per share to $2 per share. This forecast takes into account January weather and assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter. Recall that we earned $1.61 per share in the first quarter last year. There are a couple of main drivers for the quarter.\nOne, weather was unfavorable by $0.10 in Q1 last year. Of course, we're assuming normal weather for the remainder of the quarter this year. Two, with the rate design changes at Peoples Gas, under the latest commission order, we now expect base revenues will be concentrated in the first and fourth quarter heating months, when natural gas usage is the highest.\nCorrespondingly, we expect lower contributions from Peoples Gas in Q2 and Q3. We'll provide you with more details as the year progresses. As a reminder, however, in Illinois, we have a decoupling mechanism in place that mitigates the weather impact. With that, I'll turn it back to Gale.\n\nGale E. Klappa\n\nnullExecutive Chairman\n\nXia, thank you very much, operator. We're ready now for the question-and-answer portion of the call."

This call is being recorded for rebroadcast. (Operator Instructions)\nBefore the conference call begins, I remind you that all statements in the presentation, other than historical facts, are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that are subject to change at any time. Such statements are based on management's expectations at the time they are made.\nIn addition to the assumptions and other factors referred to in connection with the statements, factors described in WEC Energy Group's latest Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated.\nDuring the discussions, referenced earnings per share will be based on diluted earnings per share, unless otherwise noted. After the presentation, the conference will be open to analysts for questions and answers. In conjunction with this call, a package of detailed financial information is posted at wecenergygroup.com. A replay will be made available approximately 2 hours after the conclusion of this call.\nAnd now it's my pleasure to introduce Gale Klappa, Executive Chairman of WEC Energy Group. Please go ahead.\n\nGale E. Klappa\n\nExecutive Chairman of the Board, WEC Energy Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, and good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today as we review our results for the third quarter of 2022. First, I'd like to introduce the members of our management team who are here with me. We have Scott Lauber, our President and Chief Executive; Xia Liu, our Chief Financial Officer; and Beth Straka, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations.\nNow as you saw from our news release this morning, we reported third quarter 2022 earnings of $0.96 a share. The major factors shaped another solid quarter. Strong performance from our Infrastructure segment, an uptick from our ownership in American Transmission Company, plus a warm close to the summer in September.\nOf course, our balance sheet and cash flows remain strong and stable. And I will switch gears and provide you with some background on the Wisconsin rate settlements that we announced in October. As you recall, we filed rate reviews earlier this year with the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin for all our Wisconsin utilities.\nAfter the commission staff completed its analysis, we reached agreements with multiple parties, including the Citizens Utility Board and the Wisconsin Industrial Energy Group. In fact, more parties supported these settlements than any other settlement we've reached over the years. Scott will provide you with more detail on the terms in just a moment, but I would simply say that we view this as a very positive step forward. The process, it's now in the home stretch, and we look forward to the commission's review, which we expect in December.\nOur other big news for the day is the rollout of our ESG progress plan for the period 2023 through 2027. As you may have seen from our announcement this morning, we expect to invest $20.1 billion with an ongoing focus on efficiency, sustainability and growth. This is the largest capital plan in our history, an increase of $2.4 billion.\nThat's more than 13.5% above our previous 5-year plan. Now as we look forward, I will describe our growth trajectory as long and strong. In fact, our plan will now support compound earnings growth of 6.5% to 7% a year over the next 5 years without any need to issue equity. And as you've come to expect from us, this projected earnings growth will be of very high quality.\nHighlights of the plan include a significant increase in renewable energy projects for our regulated utilities from roughly 2,400 megawatts of capacity in our previous plan to nearly 3,300 megawatts in this plan. And as we continue to decarbonize our system, it's important to point out that passage of the Inflation Reduction Act is a real true game changer for customer affordability.\nWe now project long-term customer savings of nearly $2 billion of our investment in renewables in this 5-year plan. That's nearly double of what we projected just a year ago. We've also dedicated more capital to hardening our networks, our electric distribution networks so that we can deliver a high level of reliability for our customers.\nAnd we've included in the new ESG progress plan an increase in transmission investment. Two major factors are driving this growth. Renewable projects that require transmission and the long-range planning process being conducted by MISO, the Midwest grid operator.\nAdd it all up, shake it all around, and we have what I really believe is a premium growth plan. The projects that are driving our growth are low risk and highly executable. They're paving the way for greater sustainability, paving the way for an energy future that's affordable, reliable and clean. And now before I turn it over to Scott, I'd like to cover a significant development in our infrastructure segment.\nJust yesterday, you may have seen the news that we will acquire an 80% interest in the Maple Flats Solar Energy Center. That's a 250-megawatt project being developed by Invenergy in South Central Illinois. We plan to invest approximately $360 million for 80% ownership of the project.\nMaple Flats has an offtake agreement with a Fortune 100 company for the sale of all of the energy it will produce. And under the Inflation Reduction Act, Maple Flats will qualify for production tax credits. The project, of course, meets all our financial criteria and will further diversify the renewable assets in the infrastructure segment of our business.\nAnd finally, a brief look at the regional economy. Wisconsin added 14,400 private sector jobs in September, and the unemployment rate in the state stands at 3.2%. That's well below the national average. We continue to see major investments from growing companies in our region and a wide range of developments is in the pipeline, so I would just say watch this space.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Scott for more information on our regulatory developments, our operations and our infrastructure segment. Scott, all yours.\n\nScott J. Lauber\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, WEC Energy Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, Gale. I'd like to start by reviewing where we stand on the regulatory front. First, let's get back to the details in the rate review. Pending commission approval, a partial settlement agreements would bring several other changes beyond the base rates.\nWe've agreed to a common equity component of 53% for each of our Wisconsin utilities, consistent with our initial request. The settlement calls for the continuation of the revenue sharing mechanism that has been in place this year. The agreement also addresses the future cost recovery of the older units of our Oak Creek power plant. First, we've agreed to securitize $100 million of the book value of the plant's environmental controls. Second, after retirement, we would propose to levelize over 25 years, recovery of the remaining book value, which is approximately $400 million.\nWe agree with the settling parties that the commission should determine the return on equity for each utility, along with the allocation of revenue among customer classes. We expect the commission review by mid-December. In addition, today, we filed a rate review at one of our smaller utilities, Minnesota Energy Resources.\nWe are seeking an overall bill increase of 7.9%, primarily driven by capital investments. We expect interim rates will go into effect January 1. Meanwhile, we're making good progress on a number of regulatory capital projects. In Wisconsin, work continues on our new reciprocating internal combustion engines, or as we call them, RICE units, as well as our liquefied natural gas storage facilities. As we've discussed, these projects are needed to support the reliability of our electric and natural gas systems. And our Red Barn Wind development continues to move forward in Southwestern Wisconsin. We now expect to come online early next year with an investment of $160 million, this project will provide about 80 megawatts of renewable energy to our system.\nWork continues on the Badger Hollow II Solar facility and the Paris Solar-Battery Park. We still expect these projects to go into service next year, with the battery storage anticipated in 2024. Of course, we'll keep you updated on any future developments. We're continuing to make strides in support of a low and no carbon generation.\nJust last month, we completed our pilot project, blending hydrogen and natural gas at one of our modern RICE units in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. This is a first-in-the-world test of its kind using this technology. As you'll recall, we partnered with the Electric Power Research Institute to lead this research.\nThe project mixed hydrogen and natural gas in a 25% to 75% blend. We are still evaluating the data. However, our initial findings indicate that all project measures met or exceeded our expectations. The units performed very well and efficiently. As expected, nitrogen oxide emissions increased our equipment was able to take these emissions out and, of course, carbon-dioxide emissions were reduced.\nOur research will help demonstrate the feasibility of this approach for potential generation on a larger scale in the future. We look forward to sharing the full results with our industry and the public early next year. And as we've discussed, we've been able and working on to bring high-quality renewable natural gas to our customers.\nJust last month, we signed our fourth RNG contract contributing to our goal of net-zero methane emissions. We plan to have RNG flow in our system by early next year. Outside our utilities, we continue making good progress on projects in our WEC Infrastructure segment.\nI'm pleased to report we've completed the acquisition of the Thunderhead Wind Farm and expected to enter commercial operations later this year. And we expect Sapphire Sky Wind to go into service early next year. Together, the 2 projects represent approximately $800 million of investment. And as Gale noted, we're excited to add our first solar project to this segment with Maple Flats. And with that, I'll turn it back to Gale.\n\nGale E. Klappa\n\nExecutive Chairman of the Board, WEC Energy Group, Inc.\n\nScott, thank you very much. And as we head now into the final months of the year, we're narrowing our earnings guidance to a range of $4.38 to $4.40 a share, and we expect to reach the top end of that range. And a quick reminder about our dividend. We continue to target a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings.\nWe're positioned very well within that range, so I expect our dividend growth will continue to be in line with the growth in our earnings per share. Next up, Xia will provide you with more details on our third quarter financials. Xia, all yours.\n\nXia Liu\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, CenterPoint Energy, Inc.\n\nThanks, Gale. Our 2022 3rd quarter earnings of $0.96 per share increased $0.04 per share compared to the third quarter of 2021. Our earnings package includes a comparison of third quarter results on Page 17. I'll walk through the significant drivers.\nStarting with our utility operations. Overall, earnings across our regulated businesses were down $0.03 when compared to the third quarter of 2021. While weather was favorable relative to normal, it negatively impacted earnings by an estimated $0.03 per share quarter-over-quarter.\nOutside of weather, earnings from our utility operations were flat quarter-over-quarter. Rate base growth contributed $0.09 to earnings. This was fully offset by higher depreciation and amortization expense, an increase in day-to-day O&M and the timing of fuel expense and other items.\nIn terms of sales, on a weather-normalized basis, retail electric deliveries in Wisconsin, excluding the iron ore mines, were up 0.3%. Sales to our large commercial and industrial customers grew 2.1% compared to last Q3. Overall, retail demand for electricity is tracking our forecast. Regarding our investment in American Transmission Company, earnings increased to $0.05 compared to the third quarter of 2021.\nHigher earnings were mostly related to the resolution of historical appeals returning to the ROE used by MISO transmission owners. As of the third quarter and going forward, we're recording ATC earnings at a 10.38% return on equity.\nEarnings at our Energy Infrastructure segment improved $0.02 in the third quarter of 2022 compared to the third quarter of 2021. This was mainly driven by production tax credits from our Jayhawk Wind Farm that began commercial operation at the end of last year. Finally, you'll see that earnings at our Corporate and Other segment were flat quarter-over-quarter.\nOverall, we improved on our third quarter performance by $0.04 per share compared to last year. Looking now at the cash flow statement on Page 6 of the earnings package. Net cash provided by operating activities increased $53 million. Recovery of natural gas costs drove this increase.\nAnd total capital expenditures and asset acquisitions were $2.1 billion for the first 9 months of 2022, a $316 million increase as compared with the first 9 months of 2021. As you can see, we have been executing well on our capital plan.\nLooking forward, as Gale outlined earlier, we're excited about our plan to invest $20.1 billion over the next 5 years in key infrastructure. This ESG progress plan supports 7.4% annual growth in our asset base. Pages 18, 19 and 20 of the earnings package provide a breakdown of the plan, which I will highlight here.\nAs we continue to make our energy transition over 70% of our capital plan is dedicated to sustainability, including $7.3 billion in renewable projects and another $7.3 billion in Grid and Fleet Reliability. Additionally, we dedicated $2.8 billion to electric and gas infrastructure to support customer growth.\nWe also plan to invest $2.7 billion in technology and modernization of our systems to further generate long-term operating efficiency. This robust capital plan supports a higher and narrowed EPS growth rate of 6.5% to 7% over the long term. As always, we're using the midpoint of this year's original guidance as our base.\nTo remind you, that number is $4.31 a share. With our strong economic development backdrop and our continued focus on efficiency, sustainability and growth, we see a long runway of investment ahead, even beyond the next 5 years. As Gale said before, this trajectory is long and strong.\nIn closing, I'd like to provide our earnings guidance. For the fourth quarter, we are expecting a range of $0.73 to $0.75 per share. As a reminder, we earned $0.71 per share in the fourth quarter last year. Also, let me reiterate our guidance for 2022. As Gale noted, the new range is $4.38 to $4.40 per share.\nOur expectation is that we'll reach the top end of the range. This assumes normal weather for the remainder of the year. With that, I'll turn it back to Gale.\n\nGale E. Klappa\n\nExecutive Chairman of the Board, WEC Energy Group, Inc.\n\nXia, thank you very much. And overall, folks, we're on track and focused on providing value for our customers and our stockholders. Operator, we're now ready for the Q&A portion of the call."

Klappa\n\nExecutive Chairman of the Board, WEC Energy Group, Inc.\n\nHot town summer in the city. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today as we review our results for the second quarter of 2022.\nFirst, I'd like to introduce the members of our management team who are here with me today. We have Scott Lauber, our President and Chief Executive; Xia Liu, our Chief Financial Officer; and Beth Straka, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations.\nNow as you saw from our news release this morning, we reported second quarter 2022 earnings of $0.91 a share. A warm start to the summer, solid results from our Infrastructure segment and continued execution of our capital plan were major factors that shaped yet another strong quarter.\nIn light of this strong performance, we're again raising our earnings guidance for 2022, this time by $0.02 a share, to a new range of $4.36 to $4.40 per share. We expect to reach the top end of this new range. This, of course, assumes normal weather for the remainder of the year.\nOur balance sheet and our cash flows remain strong. And as we've discussed, this allows us to fund a highly executable capital plan without any need for new equity.\nDuring the quarter, we continued to move forward on major initiatives across the enterprise, including investments in our $17.7 billion ESG progress plan. Our focus remains on building and maintaining a highly reliable infrastructure, delivering energy that's affordable, reliable and clean. Scott will provide you with a project update in just a few moments.\nNow you may recall our recent announcement about an adjustment that we made to our schedule of power plant retirements. We plan to extend the operating lives of the 4 older units at our Oak Creek site. The retirement of units 5 and 6 will be delayed by a year until May 2024. Units 7 and 8 will be delayed for about 18 months until late in 2025. These coal-fueled units have a total rated capacity of 1,100 megawatts.\nWe based this decision on 2 critical factors: First, tight energy supply conditions in the Midwest power market; and expected delays in the delivery of solar panels and batteries, delays that will clearly affect the in-service dates of renewable projects that are now going through the regulatory approval process in Wisconsin.\nKeeping the older units at Oak Creek online a bit longer for capacity purposes makes great sense for our customers because we can avoid the need to purchase higher cost capacity in the MISO market.\nBut even with the extension of the Oak Creek units, we remain committed to our aggressive environmental goals. Across our generating fleet, we're still targeting a 60% reduction in carbon emissions by the end of 2025 and an 80% reduction by the end of 2030. And by the end of 2030, we expect to use coal only as a backup fuel, and we're aiming for a complete exit from coal by the end of 2035. The capital investments we plan fully support this transition.\nOf course, for the longer term, we remain focused on the goal of net zero carbon emissions from power generation by 2050. And as you know, we're working to help shape the future of clean energy, engaging in policy discussions and on the ground, carrying out innovative projects that can drive decarbonization of the economy.\nFor example, we've now finalized the test plans for blending hydrogen with natural gas at one of our modern gas field units in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. We've teamed up with the Electric Power Research Institute for this leading-edge project. The field work will take place this fall and the results will be shared across our industry.\nSeparately, for our natural gas distribution business, we're making great progress in securing supplies of renewable natural gas. Scott will update us shortly, but as a reminder, our plan is to achieve net zero methane emissions from our gas distribution networks by the end of 2030.\nSwitching gears now. Let's take a brief look at the regional economy. The latest data show Wisconsin's unemployment rate at 2.9%, well, of course, below the national average, and we continue to see major investments from growing companies in our region. For example, Gulfstream Aerospace is expanding its operations at the Appleton Airport. That's in Wisconsin's Fox Valley, southwest of Green Bay. The company is planning to build a world-class facility for painting and finishing aircraft exteriors. This expansion is expected to open in the third quarter of 2023, and it could add 200 new jobs to Gulfstream's existing workforce in Wisconsin.\nAnd just last month, Komatsu Mining celebrated the official grand opening of its new headquarters here in Milwaukee. The campus is already hosting about 600 employees. It includes offices, a training center and state-of-the-art manufacturing space to build heavy mining equipment.\nDuring the second quarter, groundbreaking also took place for a major expansion of the Georgia-Pacific paper mill in Green Bay. Georgia-Pacific is investing $500 million in its new facility, which is expected to bring about 100 new jobs to the region.\nSo with a wide range of developments in the pipeline, we remain very optimistic about the long-term future of the regional economy.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Scott for more information on our utility operations and our infrastructure segment. Scott, all yours.\n\nScott J. Lauber\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, WEC Energy Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, Gale. As Gale mentioned, we're making good progress on our capital plan. Construction is underway on a number of regulated projects. We have started work on the reciprocating internal combustion engines, or as we call them, RICE units, at our western site in Northern Wisconsin. These units are expected to provide 128 megawatts in of dispatchable capacity with an estimated cost of $170 million.\nAlso, work on our liquefied natural gas storage is underway. As you recall, the commission approved 2 LNG units in Southeastern Wisconsin. This $370 million investment will provide needed peaking capacity for our gas distribution business.\nOn the renewable front, we've deployed $155 million towards refurbishing projects at 2 of our regulated wind farms. When completed, these projects will enhance reliability and performance at these farms. These investments will qualify those sites for production tax credits for an additional 10 years.\nAlso, we expect our Red Barn Wind Park development in Southwestern Wisconsin to come online around the end of the year. It will provide about 80 megawatts of renewable energy to our Wisconsin Public Service customers.\nOn the solar and battery front, work continues on the Badger Hollow II solar facility and the Paris Solar Battery Park. We still expect these solar projects to go into service next year, supplying more clean energy to our Wisconsin customers. However, we've informed the Wisconsin Commission that the battery portion of the Paris project is expected to be delayed until 2024.\nAs you may recall, we have filed for approval of 2 other solar battery projects, Darien and Koshkonong. We initially plan to add these to our fleet in 2023 and 2024. We now project them to enter service in 2024 and 2025, respectively.\nIn addition, we now expect the retirement of Columbia Energy Center to take place in 2026. As you know, Alliant Energy operates the Columbia facility, and we are a part owner. Of course, we'll keep you updated on any further developments.\nAs you recall, we filed a rate review last quarter with the Public Service Commission for our Wisconsin utilities. Our proposed rate increase would support important capital investments and grid hardening projects.\nRecently, we provided an update to our filing. We factored in the extended operating lives of the older Oak Creek units and the Columbia units. This update also reflects other variables, including higher interest rates and costs associated with the completion of our solar projects. We expect final orders by the end of the year with new rates effective in January 2023. We have no other rate reviews pending at this time.\nIn our gas business, we've discussed plans to bring high-quality renewable natural gas to our customers. The Wisconsin Commission recently approved our pilot project for this initiative. Just last month, we signed our third RNG contract, which will connect our distribution system to a large dairy farm in Northeast Wisconsin. The 3 contracts in place are projected to bring us 80% of the way toward our goal of net zero methane emissions. We plan to have RNG flowing in our system by the end of this year.\nOutside of our utilities, our WEC infrastructure segment was once again a positive driver for the quarter. The Thunderhead Wind Farm located in Nebraska will be the next project to go into service scheduled for later this year. We also expect the Sapphire Sky Wind project in Illinois to come online by year-end. Together, the 2 projects represent approximately $800 million of investment, keeping us well ahead of our 5-year capital plan.\nAs you know, MISO, the Midwest grid operator, has set out a long-range plan to address transmission needs across the Midwest. And last week, the MISO board approved the transmission projects for tranche 1. At this time, American Transmission Company estimates that its investment opportunity in tranche 1 is approximately $900 million. That's in today's dollars. Investment in these long-dated projects are expected to start as early as 2027.\nAnd with that, I'll turn things back to Gale.\n\nGale E. Klappa\n\nExecutive Chairman of the Board, WEC Energy Group, Inc.\n\nScott, thank you very much.\nNow as you may recall, our Board of Directors at its January meeting raised our quarterly cash dividend by 7.4%. We believe this ranks us in the top decile of our industry. We continue to target a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings, and therefore, I expect our dividend growth will continue to be in line with the growth in earnings per share. And today, we are reaffirming our projection of long-term earnings growth at 6% to 7% a year.\nNext up, Xia will provide you with more details on our second quarter financials, and she'll touch on the likely impact of the reconciliation bill that appears to be headed for a vote in the U.S. Senate. We view the legislation as broadly positive for customers, for the energy transition and for our future investment opportunities. Xia?\n\nXia Liu\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, CenterPoint Energy, Inc.\n\nThanks, Gale. Our 2022 second quarter earnings of $0.91 per share increased $0.04 per share compared to the second quarter of 2021. Our earnings package includes a comparison of second quarter results on Page 17. I'll walk through the significant drivers.\nStarting with our utility operations. The impact of weather was flat quarter-over-quarter. On a weather-normalized basis, retail electric deliveries in Wisconsin, excluding the iron ore mines, were up 0.30%, led by our small commercial and industrial customers. Overall, retail demand for electricity is tracking our forecast.\nAcross our regulated business, we grew our earnings by $0.05 compared to the second quarter of 2021. Rate-based growth contributed $0.09 to earnings. This is partially offset by $0.03 of higher depreciation and amortization expense and a $0.01 increase in day-to-day O&M.\nAt our investment in American Transmission Company, earnings increased $0.01 compared to the second quarter of 2021, driven by continued capital investment. Earnings at our Energy Infrastructure segment improved $0.04 in the second quarter of 2022 compared to the second quarter of 2021. This was mainly driven by production tax credits related to stronger wind production across our portfolio as well as our Jayhawk Wind Farm that went in commercial operation at the end of last year.\nFinally, you'll see that earnings at our Corporate and Other segment decreased $0.06, primarily driven by rabbi trust performance and a gain last year on our investment in a clean energy fund that we recognized in the second quarter last year. Remember, rabbi trust is largely offset in O&M.\nOverall, we improved on our second quarter performance by $0.04 per share compared to last year.\nLooking now at the cash flow statement on Page 6 of the earnings package. Net cash provided by operating activities increased $536 million. Cash earnings and a normal recovery of commodity costs contributed to this increase. And total capital expenditures were $1 billion during the first half of 2022. As you can see, we have been executing well on our capital plan.\nBefore I turn it back to Gale, I'd like to give a bit of color on the recently proposed Inflation Reduction Act. I'll also provide our guidance for the third quarter.\nWe're still analyzing the details of the proposal. From what we understand now, we believe the proposal would provide additional benefits to our customers from investments in renewables.\nAn option to choose production tax credits for solar projects and the ability to transfer tax credits would provide more flexibility for future renewable investments. This would apply both at our utilities and at the WEC Infrastructure segment. So overall, we see benefits to customers, future investment opportunities and stronger credit metrics.\nNow let me give you the guidance for the third quarter. We are expecting a range of $0.82 to $0.84 per share. This accounts for weather and storm recovery costs in July, and assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter. As a reminder, we earned $0.92 per share in the third quarter last year, which included $0.05 of better-than-normal weather. And as Gale mentioned earlier, we're raising our full year guidance to a range of $4.36 to $4.40 per share with an expectation of reaching the top end of the range.\nWith that, I'll turn it back to Gale.\n\nGale E. Klappa\n\nExecutive Chairman of the Board, WEC Energy Group, Inc.\n\nXia, thank you. Overall, we're on track and focused on delivering value for our customers and our stockholders. Operator, we're ready now for the question-and-answer portion of the call."

Sir, you may begin the conference.\n\nJohn M. Campbell\n\nDirector of IR, Wells Fargo & Company\n\nThank you, Brad. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today where our CEO, Charlie Scharf; and our CFO, Mike Santomassimo, will discuss fourth quarter results and answer your questions. This call is being recorded.\nBefore we get started, I would like to remind you that our fourth quarter earnings materials, including the release, financial supplement and presentation deck are available on our website at wellsfargo.com. I'd also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risks and uncertainties.\nFactors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings, including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings materials. Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings and the earnings materials available on our website. I will now turn the call over to Charlie.\n\nCharles W. Scharf\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Wells Fargo & Company\n\nThanks very much, John, and good morning, everyone. I'll make some brief comments about our 2021 results, the operating environment and update you on our priorities. I'll then turn the call over to Mike to review fourth quarter results and some of our expectations for 2022 before we take your questions.\nLet me start with some 2021 highlights. We earned $21.5 billion or $4.95 per common share in 2021. Expenses declined 7% from a year ago, reflecting lower operating losses and progress on our efficiency initiatives. Revenue increased 6% as we benefited from strong gains from equity securities and gain from sales of our student lending, asset management and corporate trust businesses. We also have broad-based revenue growth across our businesses, including home lending, consumer and small business banking, credit card, auto, commercial real estate, banking and wealth and investment management.\nCredit quality improved significantly as the economy improved and our customers had high levels of liquidity. Our loan charge-off ratio declined from 35 basis points in 2020 to 18 basis points in 2021, and our allowance for credit losses declined by $5.7 billion. Deposits increased $78 billion or 6% and loans grew 1%, with declines in the first half of the year offset by a 5% increase in the second half.\nWe also returned a significant amount of capital to our shareholders, including increasing our common stock dividend from $0.10 per share to $0.20 per share in the third quarter. And we repurchased $14.5 billion of common stock, predominantly in the second half of the year after the return to the SCB framework. Our results in the fourth quarter also showed continued broad-based momentum. We earned $5.8 billion or $1.38 per common share. We grew loans by $32.6 billion or 4% and deposits by $12.1 billion or 1% from the third quarter.\nExpenses declined 1% from the third quarter and 11% from a year ago, and we generated positive operating leverage over both periods. Most importantly, we continued to prioritize our risk and control work. And the strong economy continues to positively impact our customers and our results. Consumers continue to have more liquidity than prior to the pandemic, though we do see this declining as the median balances today are 27% higher than pre-pandemic levels but are down 10% from the third quarter.\nConsumer credit card spend also continued to be strong, up 28% from the fourth quarter of 2020 and up 27% from the fourth quarter of 2019. Holiday sales were strong with spending up 31% the 3 weeks leading up to Thanksgiving and that momentum continued post Thanksgiving. All spending categories were up in the fourth quarter compared to a year ago, with the largest increases in travel, fuel, entertainment and dining.\nWeekly debit card spend during the fourth quarter was up every week compared to both 2019 and 2020. This increase was driven by higher transactions but also higher spend per transaction, reflecting inflationary impacts and increased spending in higher cost categories such as travel.\nWe are watching the impact from Omicron on consumer spending. And while there is some softening in restaurant, travel and entertainment in recent weeks, overall spending remained strong in the first week of January with credit card up 26% and debit card up 29% versus the same week in 2020. And we saw strong loan growth from the third quarter across our commercial businesses, including commercial real estate, asset-based lending, middle market banking and our markets and banking businesses.\nSo I've been at the company for a little over 2 years now, and I thought I'd spend a few minutes giving you my thoughts on our progress. Overall, I feel great about what we've accomplished and continue to feel energized about the opportunities in front of us. I think about this along several dimensions: talent, leadership and culture, risk regulatory and control, financial and strategic progress and our work on ESG and broader reputational issues.\nI've spoken of the substantial talent changes we've made, but just to remind you, 11 of 18 members are new to the operating committee and 2 are new to their job since I arrived. Additionally, well over half of the senior-most people at our company, meaning those who are 1 level below the operating committee, are new to their roles and a significant proportion of them were hired from outside the company. This is a dramatic change in our leadership. And with it, we've changed how we run the company, how we prioritize our work and how we view our responsibility broadly.\nWe began a process 2 years ago to change the culture and priorities of the company. And the most significant part of this prioritization was the building and implementation of an effective risk and control framework across the company. Our approach and our progress are entirely different than they were when I arrived. We are laser-focused on meeting our own expectations and those of our regulators. We have clear plans in place and clear owners for every regulatory deliverable we have. We have detailed reporting on how we're progressing on those plans. We review this reporting every single week at the operating committee level.\nThe detailed involvement of the operating committee members is very different from what was happening before I arrived. Our ability to identify issues has also improved from 2 years ago. I continue to believe that we're making significant progress, and this is based on what we see in our internal reporting. It doesn't mean that we're perfect. The fact that we have multiple consent orders makes it complex. It takes time to build all of our capabilities. And it's certainly in the regulator's purview to look at issues that have been outstanding for a long time, like the OCC did in the third quarter.\nBut I would point you to the comment made by the OCC in their recent consent order that highlights that we have taken steps to comply with their 2018 order, and we're committed to addressing remaining requirements. I remain confident in our ability to continue to close the remaining gaps over the next several years. Having said that, it continues to be the case that we're likely to have setbacks along the way. But that doesn't change the fact that we believe that the quality of the talent we now have and the processes we now have in place will enable us to get the work done.\nWe're making progress increasing the earnings power of the company and have also begun to invest in a more holistic and aggressive way to drive stronger organic growth in all of our businesses. We're just now beginning to bring things to market that are differentiated, and the number of significant opportunities are exciting. We're continuing to track to the financial return goals we've discussed: first, achieve a sustainable 10% ROTCE, subject to the same assumptions we've discussed in the past and then target 15%. We continue to believe that we will achieve the 10% during 1 of the quarters in 2022 on an annualized basis.\nTo achieve this, we're aggressively focused on driving efficiencies and we're seeing net expense reductions after significant investments in our control build-out and our businesses. We are aggressively returning excess capital to shareholders now that we've returned to the SCB framework. We continue to manage credit well, and we're seeing early benefits from higher interest rates, growing loan balances and higher fees in certain businesses. We're doing this while devoting significant resources to building our franchise.\nWe have fallen behind in providing competitive digital capabilities for our clients. This is changing. In the fourth quarter, we announced a rebuilt mobile banking experience for consumer and small business customers that is set to beginning -- set to begin rolling out this quarter. It has a new modern look and feel and a simpler user experience that will help our customers more easily accomplish their banking needs. This platform is necessary to drive significantly higher digital adoption from our customers.\nEven with our existing capabilities, in the fourth quarter, our customers logged in 1.6 billion times using a mobile device, up 7% year-over-year. Teller transactions remained more than 30% lower than pre-pandemic levels. We also announced that later this year, we'll be adding an all-new virtual assistant, Fargo to the app. Customers will be able to get answers to their everyday banking questions, ask Fargo to complete the task for them, and Fargo will also provide personalized insights and recommendations to help customers better manage their finances. We will also be introducing the first phase of the redesign of our public website early this year.\nIn addition, we're beginning to become more active on the wholesale side. For example, we announced that we're collaborating with HSBC to optimize the settlement of foreign exchange transactions through a blockchain-based solution, which will reduce settlement risks and associated costs. We're also approaching payments and credit cards very differently. We believe credit cards will remain important as both the credit and as a payment vehicle. We were also doing additional work around noncard payments and believe we must succeed here to be a key financial services provider.\nTwo years ago, our products and capabilities supporting those products were not as competitive as necessary. In 2021, we launched 2 products, including Active Cash, which we believe is the best cash-backed product in the marketplace, and Reflect, which rewards customers for on-time payments. We improved the core experience, including investing in advertising, simplifying our digital application and enhancing our underwriting. These efforts have driven an increase in digital card activation, paperless statements and enrollment alerts.\nWe are opening approximately twice as many accounts as we were prelaunch of these products, and importantly, we're not competing on credit. In fact, the quality of applications and the accounts for booking continues to be better than what we were booking historically.\nAway from card, we're beginning to invest in our broader digital payments across the platform, enhancing our capabilities, increasing limits and broadly reducing the friction and moving money. As evidence, Zelle momentum continued to accelerate with Zelle transactions up 46% from a year ago.\nWe are also taking a very different approach in that we believe that for us to be successful, we must consider a broader set of stakeholders in our decisions and actions. This is not in lieu of shareholders. In fact, we believe it will enhance our returns to shareholders over time. We have taken significant efforts to support small businesses since the beginning of the pandemic and recently fulfilled our roughly $420 million Open for Business fund commitment to assist small businesses in recovering from the pandemic, by working with not-for-profits to offer capital, technical assistance and long-term programs. The fund was created by donating the gross processing fees we made from administering the Paycheck Protection Program loans in 2020.\nAdditionally, we made significant climate commitments in 2021. In the fourth quarter, we joined the Net-Zero Banking Alliance, an industry-led leadership group designed to foster collaboration and support banks in aligning their financing with the goal of achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions. Climate change is one of the most urgent environmental and social issues of our time. And last year, we announced our goal to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions, including emissions attributable to financing by 2050. We expect to announce our first finance emission targets for the oil and gas and power sectors later this year.\nWe made our first solar-plus-battery-storage tax equity commitment. Once it is operational, it will be one of the largest solar and battery projects in the company. Last year, we surpassed $13.3 billion in cumulative tax equity investments in nearly 600 wind, solar and fuel cell transactions. These investments have provided 13% of all utility scale wind and solar capacity in the U.S. over the past 16 years. We continue to be one of the top investors in affordable multifamily housing in the U.S. as well as an active lender for affordable rental housing developments.\nAdditionally, we're committed to expanding affordable homeownership. For example, in the fourth quarter, we committed to invest $5 million through the NeighborhoodLIFT program to help more than 300 low and moderate income residents in Houston with home payment down assistance -- I'm sorry, home down payment assistance. We've also supported our employees and in December, we announced that as part of our commitment to providing comprehensive benefits and competitive pay, we're increasing U.S. minimum pay hourly pay levels to a range of $18 to $22 effective at the end of this month.\nJust this week, we announced new efforts that will roll out over the course of 2022 to help our consumer customers avoid overdraft fees and cover short-term cash needs, building on other changes we've made over the last several years. The changes we announced include the elimination of transfer fees for customers enrolled in overdraft protection, the elimination of nonsufficient fund fees, early access to direct deposit by providing customer access to funds up to 2 days before their scheduled deposit, a 24-hour grace period for customers that overdraw their account to cover the balance before incurring an overdraft fee, and a new short-term credit product for customers to meet personal financial needs.\nThis builds on existing features we already have in place, including Clear Access Banking, our no-overdraft checking account that we launched in September 2020, and we now have over 1.1 million outstanding customer accounts. Overdraft Rewind, which was introduced in 2017, which automatically rewinds overdraft fees when a covering direct deposit is received by the next morning, which were replaced by our expanded 24-hour grace period. Balance alerts that help customers avoid overdraft by sending more than 1.3 million alerts every day. Putting all of these changes in perspective, these fees are down significantly since the financial crisis. We have alternatives for both customers that do not want to overdraft and those that do. This is a competitive marketplace. We continue to review our capabilities and pricing with the goal of providing value to our customer.\nAnd let me make a few comments now as we look forward. While there is a risk with the continued growth of the Omicron variant or potentially other variants later this year, I expect to see continued strong economic trends in 2022. Consumers' financial condition remains strong. Modest debt growth, strong asset appreciation and higher deposit balances have left household balance sheets in excellent condition, which should help drive continued strong consumer spending.\nCorporate America has demonstrated the ability to adapt to the ever-changing pandemic conditions. Inventories remained unusually lean as businesses adopted a defensive posture and supply chains have been disrupted. This is expected to result in substantial gains in industrial production as they continue to restock. We're beginning to see loan growth and expect this to continue.\nIn a moment, Mike will provide our thoughts on net interest income and expenses for 2022. I commented earlier that we remain on target to achieve a sustainable 10% ROTCE, subject to the same assumptions we've discussed in the past, on a run rate basis at some point this year. And that once we've achieved this goal, we'll discuss our plan to continue to increase returns. But at a high level, we continue to believe we can further improve our returns through a combination of factors including: a modest increase in interest rates or further steepening of the curve; ongoing progress on incremental efficiency initiatives; a small impact from returns on growth-related investments in our businesses; continued execution on our risk and regulatory control framework; and moderate balance sheet growth once the asset cap is lifted. It's important to note we currently have the ability to grow loans even under the asset cap.\nThe changes we made to the company and continued strong economic growth prospects make us feel good about how we're positioned entering 2022. We also remain cognizant that we still have a multiyear effort to satisfy our regulatory requirements with setbacks likely to continue along the way. And we continue our work to put exposures related to our historical practices behind us.\nAs we look forward, we will continue to be aggressive in driving progress and improvement in our performance, embrace our responsibility to our customers and communities, and I remain incredibly optimistic about our future. I want to conclude by thanking our employees who continued to serve our customers through another challenging year. I appreciate their hard work and their resiliency while we made progress on making Wells Fargo better. I look forward to all that we accomplish in the year ahead. I will now turn the call over to Mike.\n\nMichael P. Santomassimo\n\nSenior EVP & CFO, The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation\n\nGreat. Thanks, Charlie, and good morning, everybody. Charlie summarized how we helped our customers, communities and employees last year on Slides 2 and 3, so I'm going to start with our fourth quarter financial results on Slide 4.\nNet income for the quarter was $5.8 billion or $1.38 per share -- common share. Our fourth quarter results included a $943 million net gain on the sales of our Corporate Trust Services business and Wells Fargo Asset Management. There could be future gains related to these sales due to post-closing adjustments and earn-out provisions; an $875 million decrease in allowance for credit losses as credit trends continue to be strong; and a $260 million impairment of certain leased railcars due to changes in demand for these cars.\nWe also had $2.5 billion or $1.9 billion after noncontrolling interest of equity gains, primarily from our affiliated venture capital and private equity businesses, the third consecutive quarter of strong returns in these businesses. Our effective income tax rate in the fourth quarter was approximately 23%, including the discrete impacts related to business divestitures. Our CET1 ratio declined to 11.4% in the fourth quarter, reflecting share repurchases and an increase in risk-weighted assets primarily from loan growth in the quarter.\nWe repurchased $7 billion of common stock in the fourth quarter, partially offset by $1.4 billion of new issuances, predominantly for the annual matching contribution for our 401(k) plans. As a reminder, the regulatory minimum for our CET1 ratio will be 9.1% in the first quarter of 2022, reflecting a lower G-SIB capital surcharge.\nTurning to credit quality on Slide 6. Our net charge-off ratio was 19 basis points in the fourth quarter. Commercial credit performance continued to be strong with net loan charge-offs declining $10 million from the third quarter to 2 basis points. Despite the challenges created by the pandemic, the commercial real estate portfolio has continued to perform well. Commercial real estate valuations and investment activity has rebounded off their lows across all property types, although there is still some risk in office and select hotel and retail segments.\nConsumer credit performance also remained strong with higher collateral values for homes and autos, and consumer cash reserves remain above pre-pandemic levels. Consumer net charge-offs of $393 million increased $172 million from the third quarter. $152 million of the increase is related to a change in practice to fully charge off certain delinquent legacy residential mortgage loans. Nonperforming assets increased $145 million or 2% from the third quarter, driven by an increase in residential mortgage nonaccruals, primarily resulting from certain customers exiting COVID-related accommodation programs. Loans that were modified in 2021 upon exiting forbearance are reported as nonaccrual until they perform for a period of time.\nOverall, early performance of loans that have exited forbearance have been aligned with our expectations. After increasing during the first 4 quarters of the pandemic, commercial nonperforming assets have declined for 4 consecutive quarters, and we're back to pre-pandemic levels in the fourth quarter. Our allowance level at the end of the fourth quarter reflected continued strong credit performance, the ongoing economic recovery and the uncertainties that still remain. If the economic recovery continues, we would expect to have additional reserve releases.\nOn Slide 7, we highlight loans and deposits. Average loans grew 2% from the third quarter with growth in both our commercial and consumer portfolios. We had strong growth late in the quarter and period-end loans grew $32.6 billion or 4% from the third quarter with broad-based growth across most of our commercial and consumer portfolios. I'll highlight the specific growth geographies over when discussing business segment results.\nAverage deposits increased $89.9 billion or 7% from a year ago with growth in our consumer businesses and commercial banking, partially offset by continued declines in corporate, investment banking and in corporate treasury, reflecting targeted actions to manage under the asset cap.\nTurning to net interest income on Slide 8. A year ago, we provided our expectation for 2021 net interest income to be flat to down 4% from the originally reported annualized fourth quarter 2020 level, and we ended up being down 3% for the full year. Fourth quarter net interest income was down $93 million or 1% from a year ago and grew $353 million or 4% from the third quarter. The increase in the third quarter was driven by higher loan balances, including higher interest income from loans purchased from securitization pools or EPBOs. We also benefited from higher trading assets and a favorable funding mix.\nIn the fourth quarter, we had $318 million of interest income associated with EPBOs, and at year-end, we had a total of $17.3 billion of these loans, down from $34.8 billion a year ago. And as I highlighted last quarter, we expect these balances to decline substantially by the end of this year. We also had $130 million of interest income in the fourth quarter from Paycheck Protection Program loans or PPP loans, and were outstanding -- and are outstanding decline to $2.4 billion at year-end. We've reflected the headwind from these portfolios running off in our 2022 net interest income waterfall that I will review later on the call. The net interest margin increased 8 basis points from the third quarter, 3 basis points of which was due to higher interest income from EPBOs.\nNow turning to expenses on Slide 9. Noninterest expense declined 11% from a year ago. The decrease reflected progress we made on our efficiency initiatives, including reductions in personnel costs, consultant spend and occupancy expense. I will provide specific examples of the progress we made in our efficiency initiatives in 2021 later on the call before updating you on our expense expectations for 2022. We also had lower restructuring charges and operating losses in the fourth quarter compared with a year ago. Fourth quarter expenses included 1 month or approximately $100 million of operating expenses from our Corporate Trust Services business and Wells Fargo Asset Management prior to their sales on November 1.\nNow turning to our business segments, starting with Consumer Banking lending on Slide 10. Consumer and Small Business Banking revenue increased 4% from a year ago, primarily due to higher deposit-related fees as fourth quarter 2020 included some COVID-related fee waivers. Fourth quarter 2021 also reflected an increase in consumer activity, including higher debit card transactions compared with a year ago, and the benefit of strong deposit growth was largely offset by lower spreads.\nCharlie highlighted the enhancements and changes we're making to help our customers avoid overdraft fees. The impact from the fees that will be reduced, including the elimination of nonsufficient fund or NSF fees as well as overdraft protection transfer fees, is estimated to be approximately $700 million annually. Also, we expect that they may be partially offset by other fees due to higher levels of activity as well as the expiration of various fee-related waivers that were in place in 2021. In terms of new features to be rolled out in the latter part of the year, including a 24-hour grace period for overdrafts and a new short-term loan product, we will have to observe how customers respond.\nHome lending revenue declined 8% from a year ago, primarily due to lower mortgage banking income, driven by lower gain on sale margins and origination volumes. Even before the recent rate back up, we started to see a drop in application volume in December, and we expect originations to decline in 2022, which will put pressure on margins as the industry adapts to the lower volume. Credit card revenue was up 3% from a year ago, driven by higher point-of-sale volume, partially offset by higher rewards costs, including promotional offers on our new active Cash Card. Auto revenue increased 17% from a year ago and higher loan balances with the average balances up $6.8 billion.\nTurning to some key business drivers on Slide 11. Our mortgage originations declined 7% from the third quarter. We expect our first quarter originations to continue to decline due to lower refinance activity and the typical seasonal slowdown in the purchase market. We increased our nonconforming originations in the fourth quarter and have grown our nonconforming portfolio for 7 consecutive months, reflecting the improvements in our capabilities as well as the reintroduction of cash-out refinancing late in the first quarter of 2021.\nTurning to auto. Limited vehicle inventories continued to constrain industry new car sales. However, we had our third consecutive quarter of record originations with volume up 77% from a year ago, with the majority of our originations coming from used cars. Originations also benefited from the enhancements we continue to make in our capabilities. Importantly, we are maintaining our underwriting standards and continue to be cautious about the increase in vehicle prices over the last year or so.\nTurning to debit card. Transactions were relatively stable from the third quarter and up 10% from a year ago with increases across nearly all categories. Credit card point of sale purchase volume continued to be strong, was up 28% from a year ago and 11% from the third quarter. While payment rates remain elevated, balances grew 5% from a year ago due to strong purchase volume and the launch of new products. New credit card accounts more than doubled from a year ago, driven by our new active cash card, and we're pleased by the quality of the accounts we've been attracting.\nTurning to Commercial Banking results on Slide 12. Middle Market Banking revenue increased 2% from a year ago. Results included higher deposit balances and modestly higher investment banking fees, partially offset by the impact of lower interest rates. Asset-based lending and leasing revenue increased 1% from a year ago, driven by higher net gains from equity securities and higher revenue from renewable energy investments, partially offset by lower loan balances.\nNoninterest expense declined 10% from a year ago, primarily driven by lower personnel and consulting expense due to the efficiency initiatives as well as lower lease expense. Loan balances started to increase late in the third quarter and now have grown for 4 consecutive months with growth accelerating in December. As with other portfolios, we are adhering to the same credit risk appetite. Increases in the Middle Market Banking were driven by growth from our larger clients, a modest uptick in revolver utilization and strong seasonal borrowing. Growth in asset-based lending and leasing was driven by new client wins as well as increased levels from higher prices and some increases in inventory levels.\nTurning to Corporate Investment Banking on Slide 13. Banking revenue increased 17% from a year ago. Investment Banking had a strong quarter, with higher debt origination and advisory fees. Banking results also benefited from higher loan balances. Commercial real estate revenue grew 8% from a year ago, driven by higher loan balances and capital markets results in stronger commercial real estate financing activity. Loan originations returned to pre-pandemic levels, and we had a healthy pipeline as we started the new year.\nMarkets revenue was relatively stable from a year ago. It was down 14% from the third quarter, primarily due to lower trading activity in spread products and equity derivatives. Average deposits in Corporate and Investment Banking were down $23.7 billion from a year ago, driven by actions taken across all lines of business to manage under the asset cap. Average loans increased from both the third quarter and a year ago across all lines of business. On a period-end basis, loans grew every month since June and growth accelerated in December.\nWealth and Investment Management on Slide 14. The revenue grew 6% from a year ago as higher asset-based fees and market valuations more than offset a decline in net interest income due to lower interest rates. The 5% increase in expenses from a year ago was primarily driven by higher revenue-related compensation, which was more than offset by higher revenue. This increase was partially offset by lower salaries expense, reflecting progress on efficiency initiatives. Client assets reached a record $2.2 trillion, up 9% from a year ago, primarily driven by higher market valuations. Average deposits were up 7% from a year ago and average loans increased 5% from a year ago, driven by continued momentum in securities-based lending.\nSlide 15 highlights our corporate results. Revenue increased from a year ago, driven by strong results in our affiliated venture capital and private equity businesses and gains on the sales of our Corporate Trust Services business and Wells Fargo Asset Management. These businesses contributed $1.6 billion of revenue in 2021, excluding net gains on sale and $1.5 billion of noninterest expense. We expect approximately $200 million of these expenses associated with transition services agreements to remain in 2022, with offsetting revenue so it's P&L neutral. We also expect approximately $300 million of corporate overhead expenses related to these businesses to remain in 2022, which we expect to manage down over time.\nTurning now to our expectations for 2022, starting with net interest income on Slide 16. As the last couple of weeks have demonstrated, it's challenging this early in the year to predict the rate environment, loan demand and other variables that impact net interest income for the full year. But let me highlight the key drivers of our net interest income for 2022.\nWe are assuming the asset capital remain in place throughout 2022, moving left to right on the waterfall. As we have discussed previously, we have a headwind this year from the runoff of PPP and EPBO loans. However, our current outlook loans is for average balances to grow low to mid-single digits from the fourth quarter of 2021 to the fourth quarter of 2022. Along with other balance sheet mix changes, this is expected to more than offset that headwind. This net result would increase net interest income approximately 3% in 2022 from the $35.8 billion we generated in 2021.\nMoving to rates and repricing. The recent forward curve includes approximately [3 25] basis point rate hikes this year beginning in May. Assuming this were to play out, net interest income has the potential to grow up to an additional 5%, resulting in approximately 8% net interest income growth in 2022 versus 2021. That said, the implied forward curve has changed a lot over the last 1.5 months, so it's very hard to forecast with any certainty.\nAnother way to view our asset sensitivity is from the disclosure we provided in our third quarter 10-Q filing. It showed that the estimated impact of our -- of an instantaneous 50 basis points increase in short-term rates would increase net interest income by approximately $2.7 billion over the next 12 months. Ultimately, the amount of net interest income we earn in 2022 will depend on a variety of factors, including the absolute level of interest rates, the shape of the yield curve, loan demand and cash redeployment.\nNow turning to expenses on Slide 17. We made progress last year on our efficiency initiatives and we continue to identify new opportunities. Our portfolio of initiatives that includes realized and identified potential gross saves has grown from approximately $8 billion to $10 billion, and we are continuing to work across the company. We expect to execute on our remaining identified initiatives over the next 2 to 3 years, and we'll continue to invest across our businesses. Importantly, similar to last year, we are excluding from our efficiency initiatives the resources needed to address our risk and control work, and we'll continue to add resources as necessary to complete this important work.\nWe've been reducing expenses across our businesses, but let me highlight a few examples of the progress we made last year. We eliminated management layers and increased bank control with a 20% decrease in managers with (inaudible) of control. We completed approximately 270 branch consolidations in 2021, a continuation of the progress we've made the last few years with branches down 11% since 2019. We've also optimized branch staffing levels to better reflect our customers or how our customers are using our branches.\nWithin our technology organization, we reduced nonengineering roles by approximately 40%, driven by accelerated adoption of the agile framework. And headcount across the company declined approximately 6% from a year ago, excluding divested businesses. In addition to reducing the number of branches, we also reduced our office real estate portfolio by approximately 7% and occupancy expense was down 9% compared with a year ago. This year, we expect to continue to realize savings from these initiatives, including an incremental 5% reduction in office real estate. Additionally, the investments we're making in technology should drive improvements in operations, consumer banking, consumer lending, commercial banking. Importantly, these efforts should not only reduce expenses but also improve the customer experience with enhanced fraud detection, more service self-service capabilities and faster underwriting decisions.\nNow turning to our 2022 expense outlook on Slide 18. Following the waterfall from left to right, we reported $53.8 billion of noninterest expense in 2021. This was largely in line with our most recent guidance, except for higher operating losses. We had approximately $500 million of expenses in 2021 related to business exits and restructuring charges and the civil money penalty associated with the OCC enforcement action in September. We also had approximately $1 billion of expenses in 2021 from the Wells Fargo Asset Management and our Corporate Trust Services business, which were sold and that will not continue in 2022.\nSo we believe a good starting point for the discussion of 2022 expenses is the $52.3 billion. We are assuming a modest increase in equity markets this year and expect revenue-related expenses to grow by approximately $300 million. This includes expected increases in Wealth and Investment Management and Corporate Investment Banking, partially offset by expected declines in home lending, reflecting lower origination volumes. Higher revenue-related compensation is a good thing, and the associated revenue will more than offset any increase in expenses.\nWe also expect approximately $500 million of wage and benefits-related inflationary increases in 2022 above and beyond the normal level of merit and pay increases, driven by higher personnel expenses, including the minimum wage increase that Charlie highlighted and other compensation changes. Through our efficiency initiatives, we expect to realize approximately $3.3 billion of gross expense reductions from 2022. This reduction is expected to be partially offset by approximately $1.2 billion of incremental investments primarily related to higher personnel in expenses in commercial banking, corporate and investment banking and technology as well as increased spending on risk management.\nWe also expect approximately $500 million in increased spending in other areas, including higher FDIC insurance assessments, higher travel and entertainment expenses, which were significantly lower in 2021 due to the pandemic. Accordingly, our full year 2022 expenses are expected to be approximately $51.5 billion, a net reduction of approximately $800 million versus the $52.3 billion. Embedded in our assumptions are approximately $1.3 billion of operating losses for 2022, which is the amount we had in 2021, excluding the $250 million associated with the OCC enforcement action. While we've made significant progress on working through legacy issues, as we've previously disclosed, we still have outstanding litigation and regulatory issues, and related expenses could significantly exceed the levels we had in 2021.\nWe made substantial progress last year in executing our efficiency initiatives, but we still have significant opportunity to get more efficient across the company. We are focused on achieving net expense reductions while appropriately investing in our businesses. This remains a multiyear process, with the ultimate goal of achieving an efficiency ratio in line with our peers and based on our business mix. We'll now take your questions."

[Operator Instructions] Please note that today's call is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the call over to John Campbell, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin the conference.\n\nJohn M. Campbell\n\nDirector-Investor Relations, Wells Fargo & Co.\n\nGood morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today where our CEO, Charles Scharf; and our CFO, Michael Santomassimo, will discuss second quarter results and answer your questions. This call is being recorded.\nBefore we get started, I would like to remind you that our second quarter earnings materials, including the release, financial supplement and presentation deck are available on our website at wellsfargo.com. I'd also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings, including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings materials. Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings and the earnings materials available on our website.\nI will now turn the call over to Charlie.\n\nCharles W. Scharf\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Visa, Inc.\n\nThanks, John. As usual, I'll make some brief comments about our second quarter results and update you on our priorities. I'll then turn the call over to Mike to review our results in more detail before we take your questions.\nSo let me start with some second quarter highlights. Our financial performance in the quarter benefited from our ongoing efforts to transform Wells Fargo. We continue to generate strong fee-based revenue growth with increases across most categories compared to a year ago due to both the investments we're making in our businesses and favorable market conditions with particular strength in investment advisory, trading activities and investment banking. These results more than offset the expected decline in net interest income.\nCredit performance during the second quarter was consistent with our expectations. Consumers have benefited from the strong labor market and wage increases. The performance of our consumer auto portfolio continued to improve, reflecting prior credit tightening actions and we had net recoveries in our home lending portfolio. While losses in our credit card portfolio increased as expected, early delinquency performance of our recent vintages was aligned with expectations.\nIn our commercial portfolios, losses continued to be driven by commercial real estate office properties, where we expect losses to remain lumpy. Fundamentals in the institutional owned office real estate market continued to deteriorate as lower appraisals reflect the weak leasing market in many large metropolitan areas across the country. However, they still remain within the assumptions we made when setting our allowance for credit losses.\nWe continue to execute on our efficiency initiatives, which has driven head count to decline for 16 consecutive quarters. Average commercial and consumer loans were both down from the first quarter. The higher interest rate environment and anticipation of rate cuts continued to result in tepid commercial loan demand and we have not changed our underwriting standards to chase growth. Balance growth in our credit card portfolio was more than offset by declines across our other consumer portfolios. Average deposits grew modestly from the first quarter, with higher balances in all of our consumer-facing lines of businesses.\nNow let me update you on our strategic priorities, starting with our risk [indiscernible]. We are in different Wells Fargo from when I arrived. Our operational and compliance risk and control build-out is our top priority and will remain so until all deliverables are completed, and we embed this mindset into our culture similar to the discipline we have for financial and credit risk today. We continue to make progress by completing deliverables that are part of our plans.\nThe numerous internal metrics we track show that the work is clearly improving our control environment. While we see clear forward momentum, it's up to our regulators to make their own judgments and decide when the work is done to their satisfaction. Progress has not been easy, but tens of thousands of my partners at Wells Fargo have now worked tirelessly for years to deliver the kind of change necessary for a company of our size and complexity, and we will not rest until we satisfy the expectations of our regulators and the high standards we have set for ourselves.\nWhile we have made substantial changes and have meaningfully improved our control environment, the industry operates in a heightened regulatory oversight environment, and we remain at risk of further regulatory actions. We are also a different Wells Fargo and how we are executing on other strategic priorities to better serve our customers and help drive higher returns over time.\nLet me highlight a few examples of the progress we're making. For diversity revenue sources and reducing our reliance on net interest income, we are improving our credit card platform with more competitive offerings, which is both -- which is important both for our customers and strategically for the company. During the second quarter, we launched 2 new credit cards, a small business card and a consumer card. Since 2021, we have launched 9 new credit cards and are almost complete in our initial product build-out.\nThe momentum in this business is demonstrated by continued strong credit card spend and new account growth. We are not lowering our credit standards, but see that our strong brand and a great value proposition are being well received by the market. Building a larger credit card business is an investment as new products have significant upfront costs related to marketing, promo rates, onboarding and allowance, which drive a little profitability in the early years. But as long as our assumptions on spend, balance growth and credit continue to play out as expected, we expect the card business to meaningfully contribute to profit growth in the future as the portfolio matures.\nWe have been methodically growing our corporate investment bank, which has been a priority and continues to be a significant opportunity for us. We are executing on a multiyear investment plan while maintaining our strong risk discipline and our positive momentum continues. We have added significant talent over the past several years and will continue to do so in targeted areas where we see opportunities for growth.\nFernando Rivas recently joined Wells Fargo as Co-CEO of Corporate Investment Banking. Fernando his deep knowledge of our industry and his background and skills to complement the terrific team John Weiss has put together.\nWhile we view our work here as a long-term commitment, we expect to see results in the short and medium term and are encouraged by the improved performance we've already seen with strong growth in investment banking fees during the first half of the year.\nIn our Wealth and Investment Management business, we have substantially improved adviser retention and have increased the focus on serving independent advisers and our consumer banking clients, which should ultimately help drive growth. In the Commercial Bank, we are focused on growing our treasury management business, adding bankers to cover segments where we are underpenetrated and delivering our investment banking and markets capabilities to clients and believe we have significant opportunities in the years ahead.\nAnd we continue to see significant opportunities for consumer, small and business banking franchise to be a more important source of growth.\nLet me give you just a few examples of some of the things we're doing here. We continue to optimize and invest in our branch network. While our branch count declined 5% from a year ago, we are being more strategic about branch location strategy. We are accelerating our efforts to refurbish our branches, completing 296 during the first half of this year and are on track to update all of our branches within the next 5 years.\nAs part of our efforts to enhance the branch experience, we are also increasing our investment in our branch employees and improving technology, including a new digital account opening experience, which has been a positive for both our bankers and our customers.\nWe continue to have strong growth in mobile users with active mobile customers up 6% from a year ago. A year after launching Fargo, our AI-powered virtual assistant, we have had nearly 15 million users and over 117 million interactions. We expect this momentum to continue as we make further enhancements to offer our customers additional self-service features and value-added insights including balance trends and subscription spending.\nLooking ahead, overall, the U.S. economy remains strong, driven by a healthy labor market and solid growth. However, the economy is slowing and there are continued headwinds from still elevated inflation and elevated interest rates. As managers of a large complex financial institution, we think about both the risks and the opportunities and work to be prepared for the downside while continually building our ability to serve customers and clients. The actions we have taken to strengthen the company have helped prepare us for a variety of economic environments. And while risks exist, we see significant opportunities in front of us.\nOur commitment and the progress we are making to build an appropriate operational and compliance risk management framework is foundational for our company, and we will continue to prioritize and dedicate all necessary resources to complete our work. We have a diversified business model, see opportunities to build a broader earnings stream and are seeing the early progress in our results, and we have maintained strong financial risk discipline and a strong balance sheet.\nOperating with a strong capital position in anticipation of the uncertainty the stress test regime imposes on large banks and the potential for increases to our regulatory capital requirements resulting from Basel III finalization has served as well. It also allows us to serve our customers' financial needs, and we remain committed to prudently return excess capital to our shareholders. As we previously announced, we expect to increase our third quarter common stock dividend by 14% to $0.40 per share, subject to the approval by the company's Board of Directors at its regularly scheduled meeting later this month. We repurchased over $12 billion of common stock during the first half of this year. And while the pace will slow, we have the capacity to continue repurchasing stock. I'm proud of the progress we continue to make and thankful to everyone who works at Wells Fargo. I'm excited about the opportunities ahead.\nI'll now turn the call over to Mike.\n\nMichael P. Santomassimo\n\nSenior EVP & CFO, The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation\n\nThank you, Charlie, and good morning, everyone. Net income for the second quarter was $4.9 billion or $1.33 per diluted common share. EPS grew from both the first quarter and a year ago, reflecting the solid performance in our fee-based businesses as we benefited from the market environment and the investments we've been making. We also continue to focus on driving efficiency across the company.\nI will also note that our second quarter effective income tax rate reflected the impact of the first quarter adoption of the new accounting standard for renewable energy tax credit investments, which increased our effective tax rate by approximately 3 percentage points versus a year ago. This increase in the effective tax rate had a minimal impact on net income since it had an offsetting increase to noninterest income.\nTurning to Slide 4. As expected, noninterest income was down net interest income was down $1.2 billion or 9% from a year ago. This decline was driven by higher funding costs, including the impact of lower deposit balances and customers migrating to higher-yielding deposit products in our consumer businesses and higher deposit costs in our commercial businesses as well as lower loan balances. This was partially offset by higher yields on earning assets.\nNet interest income declined $304 million or 2% from the first quarter. Given the higher rate environment meet commercial loan demand, loan balances continue to decline as expected. We saw positive trends, including average deposit balances growing from the first quarter with growth in all of our customer-facing businesses, including within our consumer business. Customer migration to higher-yielding alternatives was also lower in the quarter. This slowed the pace of growth in deposit pricing with our average deposit cost up 10 basis points in the second quarter after increasing 16 basis points in the first quarter.\nIf the Fed were to start cutting rates later this year, we expect that deposit pricing would begin to decline with the most immediate impact of new promotional rates in our consumer business and standard pricing for commercial deposits where pricing moved faster as rates increased, and we would expect betas to also be higher as rates decline.\nOn Slide 5, we highlight loans and deposits. Average loans were down from both the first quarter and a year ago. Credit card loans continue to grow while most other categories declined. I'll highlight specific drivers when discussing our operating segment results. Average deposits were relatively stable from a year ago as growth in our commercial businesses and corporate funding offset declines in our consumer businesses, driven by customers migrating to higher-yielding alternatives and continued consumer spending.\nAverage deposits grew $4.9 billion from the first quarter. Commercial deposits have grown for 3 consecutive quarters as we successfully attracted clients' operational deposits. After declining for nearly 2 years, consumer deposit balances grew modestly from the first quarter. We've seen outflows slow as many rate seeking customers in Wealth and Investment Management have already moved into cash alternative products and we've successfully used promotion and retention-oriented strategies to retain and acquire new balances in consumer small and business banking.\nThese improved deposit trends allowed us to reduce higher cost market funding. The migration from noninterest-bearing to interest-bearing deposits was similar to last quarter with our percentage of noninterest-bearing deposits declining to 26% in the first quarter to 25%.\nTurning to noninterest income on Slide 6. Noninterest income increased 19% from a year ago, with growth across most categories, reflecting both the benefit of the investments we've been making in our businesses as well as the market conditions, as Charlie highlighted. This growth more than offset the expected decline in interest income with revenue increasing from a year ago, the sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth. I will highlight the specific drivers of this growth when discussing our operating segment goals.\nTurning to expenses on Slide 7. Second quarter noninterest expense increased 2% from a year ago, driven by higher operating losses, an increase in revenue-related compensation and higher technology and equipment expense. These increases were partially offset by the impact of efficiency initiatives, including lower salaries expense and professional and outside services expense.\nOperating losses increased from a year ago and included higher customer remediation accruals for a small number of historical matters that we are working hard to get behind us. 7% decline in noninterest expense in the first quarter was primarily driven by seasonally higher personnel expense in the first quarter.\nTurning to credit quality on Slide 8. Net loan charge-offs increased 7 basis points from the first quarter to 57 basis points of average loans. The increase was driven by higher commercial net loan charge-offs which were up $127 million from the first quarter to 35 basis points of average loans, primarily reflecting higher losses in our commercial real estate office portfolio. While losses in the commercial real estate office portfolio increased in the second quarter after declining last quarter, they were in line with our expectations.\nAs we have previously stated, commercial real estate office losses have been and will continue to be lumpy as we continue to work with clients. We continue to actively work to derisk our office exposure, including a rigorous monitoring process. These efforts helped to reduce our office commitment by 13% and loan balances by 9% from a year ago.\nConsumer net loan charge-offs increased $25 million from the first quarter to 88 basis points of average loans. Auto losses continued to decline, benefiting from the credit tightening actions we implemented starting in late 2021. The increase in credit card losses was in line with our expectations as older vintages are no longer benefiting from pandemic stimulus as more recent vintages and as more recent vintages mature. Importantly, the credit performance of our newer vintages has been consistent with our expectations, and we currently expect the credit card [indiscernible] rate to decline in the third quarter. Nonperforming assets increased 5% from the first quarter, driven by the higher commercial real estate office nonaccruals.\nMoving to Slide 9. Our allowance for credit losses was down modestly from the first quarter, driven by declines across most asset classes, partially offset by a higher allowance of credit card loans driven by higher balances. Our allowance coverage for total loans has been relatively stable over the past 4 quarters as credit trends remain generally consistent. Our allowance coverage for our commercial real estate office portfolio has also been relatively stable at approximately 11% for the past several quarters.\nTurning to capital liquidity on Slide 10. Our capital position remains strong, and our CET1 ratio of 11% continue to be well above our current 8.9% regulatory minimum plus buffers. We are also above our expected new CET1 regulatory minimum plus buffers of 9.8% starting in the fourth quarter of this year as our stress capital buffer is expected to increase from 2.9% to 3.8%.\nWe repurchased $6.1 billion of common stock in the second quarter. And while the pace will slow, we have capacity to continue to repurchase common stock, as Charlie highlighted. Also, we expect to increase our common stock dividend in the third quarter by 14% subject to Board approval.\nTurning to our operating segments, starting with Consumer Banking and Lending on Slide 11. Consumer, Small and Business Banking revenue declined 5% from a year ago, driven by lower deposit balances and the impact of customers migrating to higher-yielding deposit products. Total lending revenue was down 3% from a year ago due to lower net interest income as loan balances continue to decline. Credit card revenue was stable from a year ago as higher loan balances driven by higher point-of-sale volume new account growth was offset by lower other fee revenue. Auto revenue declined 25% from last year, driven by lower loan balances and continued loan spread compression. Personal lending revenue was down 4% from a year ago, driven by lower loan balances and loan spread compression.\nTurning to some key business drivers on Slide 12. Retail mortgage originations declined 31% from a year ago, reflecting our focus on simplifying the lending business as well as the decline in the mortgage market. Since we announced our new strategy at the start of 2023, we have reduced head count in home lending by approximately 45%.\nBalances in our auto portfolio declined 14% compared with the year ago, driven by lower origination volumes which were down 23% from a year ago, reflecting previous credit-tightening actions. While debit and credit card spend increased from a year ago.\nTurning to Commercial Banking results on Slide 13. Middle Market Banking revenue was down 2% from a year ago, driven by lower net interest income due to higher deposit costs, partially offset by growth in treasury management fees. Asset-based lending and leasing revenue decreased 17% year-over-year, include lower net interest income, lower lease income and revenue from equity investments. Average loan balances were down 1% compared with a year ago. Loan demand has remained tepid, reflecting the higher for longer rate environment and a market where competition has been more aggressive on pricing and loan structure.\nTurning to Corporate and Investment Banking on Slide 14. Banking revenue increased 3% from a year ago driven by higher investment banking revenue due to increased activity across all products, partially offset by lower treasury management results driven by the impact of higher interest rates on deposit accounts. Commercial real estate revenue was down 4% from a year ago, reflecting the impact of lower loan balances. Markets revenue grew 16% from a year ago, driven by strong performance in equities, structured products and credit products. Average loans declined 5% from a year ago as growth in markets was more than offset by reductions in commercial real estate where our originations remain muted, and we have strategically reduced balances in our office portfolio, as well as declines in banking where clients continue to access capital goods funding.\nOn Slide 15, Wealth and Investment Management revenue increased 6% compared with a year ago. Higher asset-based fees driven by an increase in market valuations were partially offset by lower net interest income, reflecting lower deposit balances and higher deposit costs as customers reallocated cash into higher ELA alternatives. As a reminder, the majority of WIM and advisory assets are priced at the beginning in the quarter to the third quarter results will reflect market valuations as of July 1, which were up from both a year ago and from April 1.\nSlide 16 highlights our corporate results. Revenue grew from a year ago due to improved results from our venture capital investments.\nTurning to our 2024 outlook for net interest income and noninterest expense on Slide 17. At the beginning of the year, we expected 2024 net interest income to be approximately 7% to 9% lower than full year 2023. During the first half of this year, the drivers of net interest income largely played out as expected with net interest income down 9% from the same period a year ago. Compared with where we began the year, our current outlook reflects the benefit of fewer rate cuts as well as higher deposit balances in our businesses than what we had assumed in our original expectations, which has helped us reduce market funding.\nDeposit costs increased during the first half of this year is expected, but the pace of the increase has slowed. However, late in the second quarter, we increased pricing in Wealth and Investment Management on [indiscernible] deposits and advisory brokerage accounts. This change was not anticipated in our original guidance, better aligns rates paid in money market funds and is expected to reduce net interest income by approximately $350 million this year.\nOur current outlook also reflects lower loan balances. At the beginning of the year, we assumed a slight decline in average loans for the full year, which reflected modest growth in commercial and credit card loans in the second half of the year after a slow start to the year.\nAs we highlighted on our first quarter earnings call, loan balances were weaker than expected, and that trend continued into the second quarter. We expect this underperformance to continue into the second half of the year with loan balances declining slightly from second quarter levels. As a result of these factors, we currently expect our full year 2024 net interest income to be in the upper half of the range we provided in January, were down approximately 9% from full year 2023. We continue to expect net interest income a trough towards the end of the year. We are only halfway through the year and many of the factors driving net interest income are uncertain, and we will continue to see how each of these assumptions play out during the remainder of the year.\nTurning to expenses. At the beginning of this year, we expected our full year 2024 noninterest expense to be approximately $52.6 billion. We currently expect our full year 2024 noninterest expense to be approximately $54 million. There are 3 primary drivers for this increase. First, the equity markets have outperformed our expectations, driving higher revenue-related compensation expense and Wealth and Investment Management. As a reminder, this is a good thing if these higher expenses were more than offset by higher noninterest income.\nSecond, operating losses and the other customer remediation-related expenses have been higher during the first half of the year than we expected. As a reminder, we have outstanding litigation, regulatory and customer remuneration matters that could impact operating losses during the remainder of the year.\nFinally, we did not anticipate the $336 million of expense in the first half of the year for the FDIC special assessment, which is now included in our updated guidance. We'll continue to update you as the year progresses. In summary, our results in the second quarter reflected the progress we are making to transform Wells Fargo and improve our financial performance.\nOur strong growth in fee-based businesses offset the expected decline in net interest income. We made further progress on our efficiency initiatives. Our capital position remains strong, enabling us to return excess capital to shareholders, and we continue to make progress on our path to sustainable ROTCE of 15%.\nWe will now take your questions."

[Operator Instructions] Please note that today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to John Campbell, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.\n\nJohn M. Campbell\n\nDirector-Investor Relations, Wells Fargo & Co.\n\nGood morning. Thank you for joining our call today where our CEO, Charlie Scharf; and our CFO, Mike Santomassimo will discuss fourth quarter results and answer your questions. This call is being recorded. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our fourth quarter earnings materials, including the release, financial supplement and presentation deck are available on our website at wellsfargo.com. .\nI'd also like to ask you that we may make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings, including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings material. Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings and the earnings materials available on our website. I will now turn the call over to Charlie.\n\nCharles W. Scharf\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Visa, Inc.\n\nThanks, John. Let me start by acknowledging the unbelievable devastation from the Los Angeles wild fires. Our hearts go out to everyone who's been affected and we're committed to helping rebuild their lives, businesses and communities. I also want to thank our employees, who are working hard to support our customers, many of whom who have been impacted [indiscernible].\nTurning to Wells Fargo's performance. I'll make some brief comments about our results and update you on our priorities. I'll then turn the call over to Mike to review fourth quarter results as well as our net interest income and expense expectations for 2025 before we take your questions. Let me start with some general comments.\nOur solid performance this quarter caps a year of significant progress for Wells Fargo across multiple areas. Our earnings profile continues to improve. We are seeing the benefits from investments we're making to increase growth and improve how we serve our customers and communities. We maintained a strong balance sheet, we returned $25 billion of capital to shareholders, and we made significant progress on our risk and control work. We grew net income and our diluted earnings per share was up 11% from a year ago.\nAfter I arrived, we reviewed our businesses and sold or scaled back several which reduced revenues in the shorter term and increased investments in others. We also made a conscious effort to diversify revenues and reduce our reliance on net interest income. In 2024, our strong fee-based revenue growth up 15% from a year ago, largely offset the expected decline in net interest income, reflecting these efforts. Our disciplined approach to managing expense levels has been consistent and an important part of our success.\nWe increased investments in areas that are important for our future and generated efficiencies to help fund those opportunities. Overall, expenses declined from a year ago, benefiting from lower FDIC and severance expenses as well as the impact of our efficiency initiatives, which have helped drive head count reductions every quarter since third quarter of 2020. We maintained our strong credit discipline and credit performance was relatively stable throughout the year and consistent with our expectations.\nAverage loans declined throughout the year as credit card as growth in credit card balances was offset by declines in most other asset classes, reflecting weak loan demand as well as credit tightening actions. Average deposits grew from fourth quarter 2023, with growth in our deposit gathering businesses, enabling us to reduce higher cost CDs issued by corporate treasury. We've been actively returning excess capital over the past 5 years, and that has resulted in average common shares outstanding decreasing by 21% since fourth quarter 2019.\nThis year, we increased our common stock dividend per share by 15% and repurchased approximately $20 billion of common stock, up 64% from a year ago. Regarding our strategic priorities. I'm very proud of the progress we've made on our risk and control work, and it remains our top priority and closing consent orders is an important sign of progress. Early last year, the OCC terminated a consent order it issued in 2016 regarding cell practices. The closure of disorder was an important milestone and is a confirmation that we operate much differently today.\nThis was the sixth consent order terminated by our regulators since I joined Wells Fargo in 2019. Our operational risk and compliance infrastructure is greatly changed from when I arrived and while we are not done, I'm confident that we will successfully complete the work required in our consent orders and embed in operational risk and compliance mindset into our culture.\nOur results also show our progress on the other strategic priorities that we have. Improving our credit card platform is an important strategic objective and our [indiscernible] is clear. Since 2021, we have rolled out a total of 11 new cars, including 4 new consumer cards and a new small business card in 2024. Our new product offerings continue to be well received by both existing customers and customers new to Wells Fargo with over 2.4 million new credit card accounts opened in 2024.\nWe've done this while maintaining our credit standards. The momentum in this business is also demonstrated by strong credit card spend, up over $17 billion from a year ago. In our auto business, we announced a multiyear co-branded agreement where we will be the preferred purchase finance provider for Volkswagen and Audi brands, in the United States, starting in the first half of this year. We continue to reposition our home lending business as we execute on the strategic direction we announced in early 2023. We've reduced head count by 47% and the amount of third-party mortgage loan service by 28% since the announcement as we continue to streamline this business.\nThe business is more profitable today and opportunities remain to improve. After several years of little to no growth, as we focused on satisfying the requirements of our consent orders, we are starting to generate growth and increase customer engagement in our consumer, small and business banking segment. We had a more meaningful growth in net checking accounts in 2024. And importantly, most of that growth came in the form of more valuable primary checking accounts. We had over 10 billion debit card transactions last year, up 2% from a year ago, the highest annual volume in our history.\nWe accelerated our efforts to refurbish our branches, completing 730 in 2024. We continue to make enhancements to our mobile app, including making it significantly easier to open accounts, and in the fourth quarter, over 40% of consumer check accounts were up additionally. We grew mobile active customers by 1.5 million in 2024, up 5% from a year ago. Our customers are also increasingly using Zelle, and we have over $1 billion in sales transactions in 2024, up 22% from a year ago.\nWe introduced Wells Fargo Premier to better serve our affluent clients, and we're starting to see some early benefits from the enhancements we've made. We increased the number of premier bankers by 8% and branch-based financial advisers by 5% from a year ago with a focus on increasing the number of bankers and advisers in top locations. We have enhanced our customer relationship management capabilities for our bankers and advisers. This is increased collaboration, driving $23 billion in net asset [indiscernible] since the Wealth and Investment Management Premier channel last year.\nDeposit and investment balances for Premier clients grew steadily throughout the year and increased approximately 10% from a year ago. This remains a significant area of opportunity for us. Turning to our commercial business. In the commercial bank, we're focused on adding relationship managers and business development officers in underpenetrated and growth markets to drive new client acquisition, future revenue growth, and we expect to hire even more in 2025.\nWe created a strategic partnership with Centerbridge Partners and introduced overland advisers to better service our commercial bank customers with the direct lending product. We have targeted our investment banking capabilities towards our commercial banking clients. We're still early in these efforts, but we're starting to see results including our investment banking market share with our commercial banking clients increasing by approximately 150 basis points in 2024, which includes helping some clients access capital markets for the first time.\nAdditionally, we've been working closely with our clients to support their M&A activity, driving higher M&A-related revenue. The opportunity remains significant. We continue to make investments in talent and technology to strengthen corporate investment banking. More than 75 new hires joined CIB since 2019, with many of these in key convergent product groups within trading and banking and our revenue and share in many important areas has increased including in our markets business, where we've grown our U.S. market share, including credit trading, commodities and our equity cash and derivatives business.\nWe also continue to make steady progress in growing our FX business with strong growth in both our institutional client base and volumes in 2024. We also grew our U.S. market share in investing banking with share gains in debt and equity capital markets and increased revenue in our advisory business in 2024. We entered 2025 with a solid pipeline in both Capital Markets and Advisory, while the market conditions can always change. I feel great about our progress and continue to believe we're just beginning to see the benefits of our investments.\nWe've also continued to exit or sell businesses that are not in sync with our strategic priorities. And last year, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell the non-agency third-party servicing segment of our commercial mortgage servicing business. More broadly, the U.S. economy has performed very well and remains strong and lower inflation and unemployment [indiscernible] the economy well into 2025.\nWe are predominantly a U.S. bank, we succeed when the country succeeds. So the incoming administration support of U.S. businesses and consumers gives us optimism as we look forward. Additionally, the incoming administration has signaled a more business-friendly approach to policies and regulation, which should benefit the economy and our clients.\nMike will talk more about our expectations for 2025. But as we start the new year, I'm enthusiastic about the opportunities we have to drive higher returns across our businesses by growing revenue and managing expenses. I'm proud of the progress we made in 2024. I want to conclude by thanking everyone who works at Wells Fargo, their hard work for what they do every single day to support our customers, clients and communities. I'm excited about the momentum we're building and all that we can accomplish together in 2025. I will now turn the call over to Mike.\n\nMichael P. Santomassimo\n\nSenior EVP & CFO, The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation\n\nThank you, Charlie, and good morning, everyone. We had solid results in the fourth quarter, including net income of $5.1 billion or $1.43 per diluted common share. Underlying business performance was strong compared to a year ago. We grew fee income across most categories, maintained our expense and credit discipline and grew customer accounts and activity levels as we benefited from the investments that Charlie highlighted. We also grew net interest income from the third quarter.\nOur fourth quarter results included $863 million or $0.26 per share of discrete tax benefits related to resolution of prior period matters. This benefit was largely offset by $647 million or $0.15 per share of [indiscernible] and $448 million or $0.10 per share of net losses on the sale of debt securities as we took the opportunity to further reposition [indiscernible] of the investment portfolio. This included the sale of approximately $8 million of securities, which we reinvested into higher-yielding securities. The estimated payback period for this repositioning is approximately 2.5 years.\nTurning to Slide 4. Net interest income grew $146 million or 1% from the third quarter, the first linked-quarter increase since the fourth quarter of 2022. The increase was driven by higher customer deposit balances, which enabled us to continue to reduce higher cost market funding. Moving to Slide 5. Average loans were down from both the third quarter and a year ago, Period-end balances grew $3 billion from the third quarter with growth in commercial and industrial loans and credit card loans more than offsetting declines in most other categories.\nAverage deposits increased both from the third quarter and a year ago with growth in our customer deposits, enabling us to reduce higher-cost corporate treasury deposits. Average deposit cost declined 18 basis points from the third quarter as deposit costs stabilized or declined across all of our deposit gathering businesses. In response to the Federal Reserve rate cuts, we have reduced standard pricing for commercial clients as well as pricing for promotional deposit offers and CDs in our consumer businesses. Lower deposit costs also reflected the slowdown of customer migration to higher yielding deposits.\nAdditionally, lower cost consumer deposit balances and checking and saving accounts have continued to stabilize. Turning to Slide 6. We had strong growth in noninterest income, up 11% from a year ago, benefiting from the investments we've been making in our businesses as well as market conditions. This growth was diversified with each of our operating segments generating growth from a year ago. I'll highlight the specific drivers of noninterest income and discussing our operating segment results.\nTurning to expenses on Slide 7. Noninterest expense declined 12% from a year ago, driven by the lower FDIC special assessment. Excluding this assessment, expenses were relatively stable as lower severance expense and the impact of our efficiency initiatives was largely offset by higher revenue-related compensation predominantly in Wealth and Investment Management as well as higher technology and equipment expense.\nTurning to credit quality on Slide 8. Credit performance has been relatively stable with our net loan charge-off ratio the same as a year ago and up 4 basis points from the third quarter. Commercial net loan charge-offs increased $80 million from the third quarter to 30 basis points of average loans, driven by the commercial real estate office portfolio. Commercial real estate office fundamentals have not changed and remain weak. We still expect commercial real estate office losses to be lumpy as we continue to actively work with our clients.\nConsumer net loan charge-offs increased $20 million from the third quarter to 85 basis points of average loans, driven by higher losses in the credit card portfolio, which was consistent with our expectations. Nonperforming assets declined 5% from the third quarter, driven by a $390 million decline in commercial real estate office nonaccrual loans, which includes paydowns and net loan charge-offs.\nMoving to Slide 9. Our allowance for credit losses for loans was down $103 million from the third quarter, with modest declines across most asset classes partially offset by the increase in allowance for credit card loans driven by higher loan balances. Our allowance coverage for total loans has been relatively stable over the past 5 quarters as credit trends have remained fairly consistent. Our allowance coverage for our corporate and investment banking and commercial real estate office portfolio increased 12% as loan balances continued to decline and allowance levels were relatively stable.\nTurning to capital and liquidity on Slide 10. Our capital position remains strong, and our CET1 ratio of 11.1% continues to be well above our CET1 regulatory minimum plus buffers of 9.8%. We repurchased $4 million of common stock in the fourth quarter and approximately $20 million for the year, reducing common shares outstanding by 9% from a year ago.\nTurning to our operating segments, starting with Consumer Banking lending on Slide 11. Consumer Small and Business Banking revenue declined 7% from a year ago, driven by lower net interest income, reflecting the impact of customers migrating to higher yield and deposit products. However, the pace of the migration continues to slow. Home lending revenue grew 2% from a year ago driven by higher mortgage banking fees. Credit card revenue grew 3% from a year ago as loan balances increased and card fees grew from a higher point of sale volume. We continue to be pleased with the performance of new products that we launched over the last 3.5 years, with credit performing as expected and strong growth in new accounts and usage.\nAuto revenue decreased 21% from a year ago, driven by lower loan balances, reflecting previous credit tightening actions and continued loan spread compression. The decline in personal lending revenue from a year ago is also driven by lower loan balances and loan spread compression. Turning to some key business drivers on Slide 12. Retail mortgage originations increased 31% from a year ago with higher purchase volume as well as stronger refinance volume early in the quarter when interest rates were lower. Debit card spending was strong in the fourth quarter and increased $4.9 billion or 4% from a year ago, and credit card spending was up 9% from a year ago, with growth in all categories except [indiscernible].\nTurning to Commercial Banking results on Slide 13. Middle Market Banking revenue was down 2% from a year ago, driven by lower net interest income, reflecting higher deposit costs, partially offset by growth in treasury management fees. Asset-based lending and leasing revenue decreased 12% from a year ago, driven by lower net interest income and lease income, partially offset by improved results from our equity investments. Average loan balances in the fourth quarter were down 1% compared with a year ago as growth in middle market banking was more than offset by lower balances in asset-based lending.\nWhile our commercial clients are generally more optimistic, we did not see a meaningful change in loan demand in the fourth quarter as many clients remain cautious. Turning to Corporate and Investment Banking on Slide 14. We Banking revenue was down 4% from a year ago, driven by higher deposit costs and lower loan balances. This decline was partially offset by higher investment banking revenue from increased activity in equity and debt capital markets as well as higher advisory fees.\nCommercial real estate revenue decreased 1% from a year ago, reflecting the impact of lower loan balances, partially offset by higher capital markets revenue from higher volumes in commercial mortgage-backed securities, real estate loan syndications and multifamily capital as market sentiment improves. Markets revenue was down 5% from a year ago, driven by lower revenues in equities and municipals, partially offset by stronger performance than most other products, fixed income products.\nOur fourth quarter results reflected the implementation of a change to incorporate funding valuation adjustments for our derivatives which resulted in a loss of $85 million. The decline from the third quarter was also driven by seasonally lower trading activity across most asset classes. Average loans declined 6% from a year ago, driven by continued reductions in our commercial real estate portfolio driven by office as well as lower loan balances in banking as clients continued to access to capital markets for funding. On Slide 15, Wealth and Investment Management revenue increased 8% compared with a year ago due to higher asset-based fees driven by increased market valuations.\nAs a reminder, the majority of [indiscernible] advisory assets are priced at the beginning of the quarter, so first quarter results will reflect market valuations as of January 1, which were up from both a year ago and from October 1. Average deposits increased by 16% and average loans grew by 2% from a year ago, which have both benefited from product enhancements and pricing improvements that provide value to our clients. The growth in deposits also reflected the slowdown in migration to cash alternatives with balances in those products lower than a year ago.\nSlide 16 highlights our corporate results. Revenue increased from a year ago, driven by improved results from our venture capital investments. After having impairments on these investments for the past 2 years, we had net gains every quarter in 2024 with improved performance in the second half of the year.\nNow turning to our outlook on Slide 17. I'll go into more detail on our 2025 expectations for net interest income and noninterest expense in the next few slides, but first, I want to highlight the progress we've made on improving our returns. When we first started discussing the outlook for our returns in the fourth quarter of 2020, we had an 8% ROTCE. Over the past 4 years, we have been successfully executing on our efficiency initiatives, diversifying our sources of revenue by investing in our businesses to better serve our customers and drive growth and returning excess capital to shareholders.\nThese actions helped to improve our ROTCE to 13.4% in 2024. We still believe we have an achievable path to a sustainable ROTCE of 15% as we continue to make progress on transforming the company, including the priorities highlighted earlier on the call.\nOn Slide 18, we provide our expectations for net interest income for 2025. We had $47.7 billion of net interest income in 2024, which was within the expected range we provided at the start of last year. Net interest income declined sequentially for the first 3 quarters of the year before growing modestly in the fourth quarter. Our fourth quarter annualized net interest income is $47 billion or approximately $700 million lower than full year 2024. Our current expectation is that full year 2025 net interest income will be approximately 1% to 3% higher than full year 2024 or approximately 3% to 5% higher than the annualized fourth quarter 2024 net interest income.\nWe expect net interest income will be relatively stable in the first half of 2025, which includes the impact from 2 fewer days in the first quarter with more growth in the second half of the year. Underpinning our expectations are a series of key assumptions, including using the recent forward rate curve, which includes between 1 and 2 [indiscernible] rate cuts, given our modestly asset-sensitive position, this will be a slight headwind to net interest income.\nAverage loans are expected to grow modestly from fourth quarter of 2024 to fourth quarter of 2025 driven by anticipated growth in the Corporate Investment Bank markets group and CIB banking as well as anticipated growth in our auto and credit card portfolios. Deposits in all our deposit gathering businesses are expected to grow modestly, which would allow us to further reduce higher-cost market funding. Reinvestment of lower-yielding securities into higher yielding assets, our expectation also reflects the benefits from the actions we took in the second half of 2024 to reposition the investment portfolio. And trading-related net interest income is expected to be higher due to lower interest rates which would largely be offset by lower trading-related noninterest income.\nAs we've done in prior years, for the purposes of estimating net interest income, we are also assuming the asset capital remained in place throughout the year. Ultimately, the amount of net interest income we earned in 2025 will depend on a variety of factors, many of which are uncertain, including the absolute level of interest rates, the shape of the curve, deposit balances, mix and pricing and loan demand.\nNow turning to our 2025 expense expectations on Slide 19. Following the waterfall on the slide from left to right, we reported $54.6 billion of noninterest expense in 2024, which includes $647 million of severance expense in the fourth quarter that was not contemplated in our guidance. Our 2025 expense expectation includes operating losses of approximately $1.1 billion, which is approximately $700 million lower than operating losses in 2024. Looking at the next bar, we expect severance expense to be approximately $500 million lower in 2025 given the expense of [indiscernible] we took in the fourth quarter of 2024.\nWe expect Wealth and Investment Management revenue-related expenses to increase by approximately $600 million in 2025. As a reminder, this is a good thing as these higher expenses were more offset by higher noninterest income. Actual revenue-related expenses will be a function of market levels with the biggest driver being the equity markets. Our outlook that assumes the S&P 500 will be up modestly from current levels, but clearly, the ultimate performance of the markets is uncertain. We expect all other expenses to be up approximately $200 million with the impact of efficiency initiatives, more than offset by higher investments in other expenses.\nWe expect approximately $2.4 billion of gross expense reductions in 2025 due to efficiency initiatives. We've successfully delivered on more than $12 billion of gross expense saves since we started focusing on efficiency initiatives 4 years ago, and we continue to believe we have opportunities to get more efficient across the company. Keep in mind, however, the resources needed to address our risk and control work are separate from our efficiency initiatives. There are 3 primary areas where we expected to invest.\nFirst, we expect approximately $900 million of incremental technology expense, including investments in infrastructure and business capabilities. Second, we expect approximately $900 million of incremental other investments, including the specific areas we highlighted on the next slide. Finally, we expect other expenses to increase by approximately $800 million, including expected merit increases in performance-based discretionary compensation.\nAs a reminder, the first quarter has seasonally higher personnel expenses, which are expected to be $650 million to $700 million. Putting this all together, we expect 2025 noninterest expense to be approximately $54.2 billion.\nOn Slide 20, we provide some examples of our areas of focus for the investments, which are critical to better serving our customers and generating growth. Let me highlight a few. Building the right risk and control infrastructure remains our top priority, and we will continue to invest in this important work. We continue to invest in technology and digital platforms to transform how we serve both our consumer and commercial customers. This includes continuing the transition of our applications to the cloud, migrating into new data centers and investing in data platforms to drive more insights.\nWe are continuing to upgrade our core lending capabilities, including improvements to our fulfillment and servicing systems, enhancing private decisioning and strengthening fraud capabilities. To drive customer growth in the consumer businesses, we plan to continue scaling our marketing efforts, modernizing our branch footprint and increasing the number of premier bankers and financial advisers. We are also focused on onboarding more independent advisers as we continue building out our independent brokerage channel.\nIn addition, we continue to improve our digital capabilities for our customers, specifically our mobile account opening and onboarding as well as Zelle. We plan to continue hiring priority sectors to help drive growth in investment banking and capital markets. We also plan to continue hiring relationship bankers within commercial banking to build out coverage in underpenetrated markets in key industries.\nIn summary, our results in 2024 demonstrated the continued progress we've been making to improve our financial performance. We generated strong fee-based revenue growth, reduced our expenses, maintain strong credit discipline, increased capital returns to shareholders and retained our strong capital position. I'm very pleased with the progress we've made so far and excited about the additional opportunities we have to continue to try and improve performance. We will now take your questions."

(Operator Instructions) Please note that today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to John Campbell, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin the conference.\n\nJohn M. Campbell\n\nDirector of IR, Wells Fargo & Company\n\nThanks, Brad. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today where our CEO, Charlie Scharf; and our CFO, Mike Santomassimo, will discuss first quarter results and answer your questions. This call is being recorded. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our first quarter earnings materials, including the release, financial supplement and presentation deck are available on our website at wellsfargo.com.\nI'd also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings, including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings materials. Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures can also be found in our SEC filings and the earnings materials available on our website.\nI will now turn the call over to Charlie.\n\nCharles W. Scharf\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Wells Fargo & Company\n\nThanks, John, and good morning, everyone. I'll make some brief comments about our first quarter results, the operating environment and update you on our priorities. I'll then turn the call over to Mike to review the first quarter results in more detail before we take your questions.\nLet me start off with some first quarter highlights. We earned $3.7 billion or $0.88 per common share in the first quarter. Our results included $0.21 per share impact from a decrease in the allowance for credit losses. We have broad-based loan growth with both our consumer and commercial portfolios growing from the fourth quarter. While net interest income was down modestly from the fourth quarter, driven by fewer days in the quarter, it grew 5% from a year ago. Higher interest rates, along with our expectations for continued loan growth should drive higher net interest income growth that we anticipated at the beginning of the year.\nMike will provide more details regarding our current view later on in the call. However, the increase in rates negatively impacted our mortgage banking business. The mortgage origination market experienced one of its largest quarterly declines that I can remember and it will take time for the industry to reduce excess capacity. Credit performance remained incredibly strong, and our net charge-off ratio declined to 14 basis points. While we have minimal direct exposure to Russia or Ukraine, we're monitoring certain industries that have the potential to be impacted by the conflict and economic sanctions, but thus far don't have concerns.\nIn addition, we returned a significant amount of capital to our shareholders in the first quarter, including repurchasing $6 billion of common stock and increasing our common stock dividend to $0.25 per share. The significant changes we've made across the company have put us in a position to increase the dividend and our work continues. The health of our consumer and businesses so far has remained strong, though we're entering a period of uncertainty.\nMarch was the eighth straight month in which inflation outpaced income with lower income consumers being most impacted by rising energy and food prices. That said, higher deposit balances and rising wages have thus far allowed consumers to weather these headwinds. We continued to see median deposit balances above pre-pandemic levels, up approximately 25% compared to 2020 but down from the highs observed in 2021.\nConsumer credit card spend remained strong, up 33% from a year ago. All spending categories were up with the highest growth in travel, entertainment, fuel and dining. After strong growth in the first quarter of 2021, driven by stimulus payments, debit card spending increased 6% in the first quarter of 2022. Discretionary spending remained strong with entertainment up 39% and travel up 29% from a year ago.\nThe increase in energy prices was reflected in a 27% increase in fuel spending. Loan demand from our commercial customers increased with growth in both commitments and loans outstanding as customers' borrowing needs are increasing to fund working capital expansion. Credit quality remained strong with net recoveries in our commercial portfolio. Now let me update you on progress we've made on our strategic priorities. Building an appropriate risk and [control] infrastructure remains our top priority, and I continue to believe that we're making significant progress.\nEarly in the first quarter, we named Derek Flowers, our new Chief Risk Officer, following Mandy Norton's retirement announcement. Derek has extensive experience managing risk including the work he's done over the last several years of managing the build-out of Wells Fargo's risk and control framework. Derek has been with Wells Fargo for over 20 years and his familiarity with the company and its risk background make him the ideal candidate to succeed Mandy, who I'd like to thank for the tremendous progress she made in transforming the risk organization.\nWe also continue to make progress in resolving legacy regulatory issues with news in January that the OCC had terminated a consent order regarding add-on products that the company sold to retail banking customers before 2015. We have much more work to do to satisfy our regulatory requirements, and we will likely have setbacks, but I'm confident in our ability to continue to close the remaining gaps over the next several years. We remain focused on improving our financial performance while investing to drive growth across our businesses.\nProviding our customers with simple, easy to use and fast digital experiences is one of our most important strategic priorities. In the first quarter, we began rolling out our new mobile banking experience for our customers in our consumer businesses, and feedback has been very positive. Digital adoption, which is critical to both delivering seamless digital experiences that our customers expect and reducing the cost to serve has continued to increase with mobile active customers up 4% from a year ago.\nWe added approximately 500,000 new mobile active customers in the first quarter alone. We continue to invest to improve our digital capabilities with additional enhancements planned for this year. We're also focused on reducing friction and moving money. We've continued to invest in Zelle and made changes to expand customer usage, including increasing sending limits. These changes have helped to drive 21% growth in active send customers and a 33% increase in send volume from a year ago. We continued to enhance our credit card offerings with our partnership with Bilt Rewards and MasterCard. This first of its kind co-brand card allows members to pay rent and earn points with no transaction fees on rent payments at any apartment in the U.S.\nIn the first quarter, we selected nCino to streamline our origination, underwriting and portfolio management for our small business customers. This collaboration is expected to provide our customers with a more streamlined lending experience and builds on our existing relationship that we announced last year to accelerate our digital transformation within our Commercial Banking and corporate investment banking businesses.\nLet me just make some summary comments before I turn it over to Mike. As we sit here today, our internal indicators continue to point towards the strength of our customers' financial position but the Federal Reserve has made it clear that it will take actions necessary to reduce inflation and this will certainly reduce economic growth. In addition, the war in Ukraine adds additional risk to the downside. Wells Fargo is positioned well to provide support for our clients in a slowing economy. While we will likely see an increase in credit losses from historical lows, we should be a net beneficiary as we will also benefit from rising rates.\nWe have a strong capital position and our lower expense base creates greater margins from which to invest. We remain diligent in extending credit and are focusing on managing the other risk types within the company as well. We remain on target to achieve a sustainable 10% ROTCE subject to the same assumptions we've discussed in the past on a run rate basis at some point this year.\nWe continue to focus on a broad set of stakeholders in our decisions and actions. As we have all seen, the reports and images coming out of Ukraine are deeply concerning. In order to support those most impacted, we announced $1 million in donations across 3 nonprofits in support of humanitarian aid for Ukraine and Ukrainian refugees as well as services that support the U.S. military.\nEarlier this week, we also announced plans to introduce HOPE Inside centers in select branches to increase access to financial education and guidance. Working with Operation HOPE is one important way that we can remove barriers to financial inclusion as part of our banking inclusion initiative, which is focused on helping more people who are unbanked gain access to affordable mainstream banking products. Since the pandemic began, close to 100,000 of our employees never left the workplace. And last month, we started to welcome the rest back to the office. It's been great to be back together again, and I want to thank all of our employees as they work together to better serve our customers, our communities and each other.\nI will now turn the call over to Mike.\n\nMichael P. Santomassimo\n\nSenior EVP & CFO, The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation\n\nThank you, Charlie, and good morning, everyone. Net income for the quarter was $3.7 billion or $0.88 per common share, and our results included a $1.1 billion decrease in the allowance for credit losses, predominantly due to reduced uncertainty around the economic impact of COVID on our loan portfolios. Our effective income tax rate in the first quarter was approximately 16%, which included net discrete income tax benefits due to stock-based compensation. We expect our effective income tax rate for the full year to be approximately 18%, excluding any additional discrete items.\nOur CET1 ratio declined to 10.5%, still well above our regulatory minimum of 9.1%. We highlight capital on Slide 3. The decrease in our CET1 ratio from the fourth quarter reflected a $5.1 billion reduction in cumulative other comprehensive income, driven by high interest rates and wider agency MBS spreads, which reduced the ratio by approximately 40 basis points.\nHigher risk-weighted assets driven by growth in loan balances and commitments, we adopted the standardized approach for counterparty credit risk, which had a minimal impact on total risk-weighted assets, and we continued with our strong capital returns. We repurchased $6 billion of common stock in the first quarter, bringing our total repurchases since the third quarter of 2021 to $18.3 billion, which is in line with our 2021 capital plan. While we have flexibility under the stress capital buffer framework to exceed the share repurchases contemplated in our capital plan, we will be disciplined in our approach, given the current rate volatility and currently expect to have significantly lower levels of share buybacks in the second quarter.\nFinally, we've submitted our 2022 capital plan. And as I've called out before, it's possible that our stress capital buffer could increase when the Federal Reserve publishes our official stress capital buffer in the third quarter, while our GSIB surcharge of 1.5% will remain the same for 2023.\nTurning to credit quality on Slide 5. Our net loan charge-off ratio declined to 14 basis points in the first quarter. Commercial credit performance was strong again with $29 million of net recoveries in the first quarter driven by recoveries in energy, asset-based lending and middle market. Consumer credit performance was also strong. Credit losses were down $59 million from the fourth quarter, which included $152 million of net charge-offs related to a change in practice to fully charge off certain delinquent legacy residential mortgage loans.\nThe first quarter included higher auto losses and seasonally higher credit card losses. Nonperforming assets decreased $323 million or 4% from the fourth quarter. Commercial nonaccruals were down $423 million, declining again this quarter and are now below pre-pandemic levels. Consumer nonaccruals increased $82 million driven by an increase in residential mortgage on accruals and primarily resulting from certain customers exiting COVID-related accommodation programs. Overall, early performance of loans that have exited forbearance have exceeded our expectations.\nOur allowance for credit losses at the end of the first quarter reflected continued strong credit performance, less uncertainty around the economic impact of COVID, the economic recovery thus far and an outlook that reflects the increasing risks from high inflation in the Russian-Ukraine conflict. On Slide 6, we highlight loans and deposits. Average loans grew 3% from a year ago in the fourth quarter. Period-end loans grew for the third consecutive quarter and were up 6% from a year ago, with growth in both our commercial and consumer portfolios. I'll highlight the specific growth drivers when discussing business segment results.\nAverage deposits increased $70.6 billion or 5% from a year ago, with growth in our consumer businesses and Commercial Banking, partially offset by continued declines in Corporate and Investment Banking and Corporate Treasury reflecting targeted actions to manage under the asset cap. Turning to net interest income on Slide 7.\nFirst quarter net interest income increased $413 million or 5% from a year ago and declined $41 million from the fourth quarter. The decline from the fourth quarter was driven by $178 million of lower income from EPBO and paycheck protection program loans as well as 2 fewer days in the quarter, which offset the impact of higher earning asset yields and higher securities and loan balances. Last quarter, we highlighted that net interest income for full year 2022 could potentially increase by approximately 8% driven by loan growth and other balance sheet mix changes as well as the benefit from rising rates, which was based on the forward curve at that time.\nObviously, a lot has changed over the past 3 months. Loan growth has been solid and average loan balances were up 3% versus the fourth quarter and 2% at period end. If we continue to see increased demand, it's possible that average loan balances will be up in the mid-single digits from the fourth quarter 2021 to fourth quarter 2022, up from our prior outlook earlier this year of low to mid-single digits.\nThe rate increase is currently included in the forward rate curve would also drive stronger net interest income growth than we anticipated earlier in the year. However, it's important to note that the benefit from rising rates is not linear, and we would expect deposit betas to accelerate after the initial rate hikes and customer migration from lower-yielding to higher-yielding deposit products would also likely increase. Higher rates will also have a negative impact on mortgage volumes and potentially on market-related fees in corporate and investment banking, private equity and venture capital businesses and in wealth management.\nGiven our current expectations for higher loan growth and recent forward rate curves, net interest income for full year 2022 could be up mid-teens on a percentage basis from 2021. That said, net interest income growth will ultimately be driven by a variety of factors, including the magnitude and timing of Fed rate increases, deposit betas and loan growth. Now turning to expenses on Slide 8.\nNoninterest expense declined 1% from a year ago. We continue to make progress on our efficiency initiatives and expenses also declined due to divestitures last year. The first quarter included approximately $600 million of seasonally higher personnel expenses, including payroll taxes, restricted stock expense for retirement eligible employees and 401(k) matching contributions. We also had $673 million of operating losses, which were primarily driven by higher customer remediation expense predominantly for a variety of historical matters.\nOur full year 2022 expenses are still expected to be approximately $51.5 billion. However, as we experienced this quarter, operating losses can be episodic and hard to predict, and we will continue to update you on our expense expectations throughout the year. Turning to our operating segments, starting with Consumer Banking and lending on Slide 9. Consumer and Small Business Banking revenue increased 11% from a year ago, primarily due to higher deposit balances, higher deposit-related fees, primarily reflecting lower fee waivers and an increase in debit card transactions.\nWe continue to reduce the underlying cost to run the business and serve customers. Customers have continued to migrate to digital channels and correspondingly teller transactions are down 45% from pre-pandemic levels. Over the same period, we've decreased our number of branches by 12% and branch staffing by approximately 30%, and we have more opportunities to improve our efficiency while we continue to make enhancements to better serve customers.\nEarlier this year, we announced changes that we are making to help our customers avoid overdraft fees. We began to implement some of these new policies and we'll be rolling out the rest of the changes this year. We eliminated fees for nonsufficient funds and overdraft protection transactions in early March. So these changes didn't have a meaningful impact on the first quarter results. We still expect the annual decline in these fees to be approximately $700 million.\nHowever, as we highlighted last quarter, this is an annualized estimate and the reduction may be partially offset by higher levels of activity, and we will observe how customers respond to the new features that will be introduced in the latter part of the year. Home lending revenue declined 33% from a year ago and 19% from the fourth quarter, driven by lower mortgage originations and (inaudible) margins given the higher rate environment and competitive pricing in response to excess capacity in the industry.\nMortgage rates increased 156 basis points in the first quarter and are above rate levels observed for the most of the last -- for most of the last decade. Reflecting this environment, we expect second quarter originations and margins to remain under pressure and mortgage banking revenue to continue to decline. We've started to reduce expenses in response to the decline in volume and expect expenses will continue to decline throughout the year as excess capacity is removed and aligned to lower business activity.\nCredit card revenue was up 6% from a year ago, driven by higher loan balances and point-of-sale volumes. Auto revenue increased 10% and personal lending was up 2% from a year ago, primarily due to higher loan balances. Turning to some key business drivers on Slide 10. Our mortgage originations declined 21% from the fourth quarter. We believe the mortgage market experienced its largest quarterly decline since 2003, primarily due to lower refinance activity in response to higher mortgage rates. Home lending loan balances grew modestly from the fourth quarter, driven by the third consecutive quarter of growth in our nonconforming portfolio, which more than offset declines in loans purchased from securitization pools or EPBOs.\nTurning to auto. Origination volume increased 4% from a year ago, but was down 22% from fourth quarter due to credit tightening in higher risk segments and increased price competition as interest rates rose, and we targeted solid returns for new originations. Turning to debit card. Transactions declined 7% from the fourth quarter due to seasonality and were up 3% from a year ago with double-digit growth in travel and entertainment.\nCredit card point-of-sale purchase volume continued to be strong, it was up 33% from a year ago, but down 5% from the fourth quarter due to seasonality. While payment rates remain elevated, balances grew 14% from a year ago due to strong purchase volume and the launch of new products. New credit card accounts increased over 80% from a year ago, and we continue to be pleased by the quality of the accounts we're attracting.\nTurning to Commercial Banking results on Slide 11. Middle Market Banking revenue increased 8% from a year ago, driven by higher deposit and loan balances as well as the impact of higher interest rates. Asset-based lending and leasing revenue increased 17% from a year ago, driven by higher loan balances, stronger net gains from equity securities and higher revenue from renewable energy investments. Noninterest expense declined 6% from a year ago, primarily driven by lower personnel and occupancy expense due to efficiency initiatives and lower lease expense.\nAfter declining during the first half of last year, average loan balances have grown for 3 consecutive quarters and were up 6% from a year ago. Revolver utilization rates have increased but are still well below historical levels. Loan demand has been driven by larger clients who are increasing borrowing due to the impact of inflation on material and transportation costs as well as to support inventory growth. We're also seeing new demand from some clients who are catching up from underinvestment in projects and capital expenditures over the past couple of years.\nTurning to Corporate and Investment Banking on Slide 12. We Banking revenue increased 4% from a year ago, primarily driven by higher loan balances and improved treasury management results. Average loan balances were up 18% from a year ago with increased demand across most industries driven primarily by capital expenditures and growing working capital needs. Commercial real estate revenue grew 9% from a year ago, driven by the higher loan balances and higher revenue in our low-income housing business. Average loan balances were up 17% from a year ago, and originations in the first quarter outpaced volumes from a year ago and loan pipelines continue to be strong.\nMarkets revenue was down 18% from a year ago, primarily due to lower trading activity in residential mortgage-backed securities and high-yield products. Average deposits in corporate investment banking were down $25.3 billion or 13% from a year ago, driven by continued actions to manage into the asset cap.\nOn Slide 13, Wealth and Investment Management revenue grew 6% from a year ago, driven by higher asset-based fees on higher market valuations and higher net interest income from the impact of higher interest rates as well as higher deposit and loan balances. As a reminder, the majority of WIM advisory assets are priced at the beginning of the quarter. So first quarter results reflected market valuations as of Jan 1, and second quarter results will reflect the lower market valuations as of April 1. The 5% increase in expenses from a year ago was primarily driven by higher revenue-related compensation, which was more than offset by higher revenue.\nAverage deposits were up 7% from a year ago and average loans increased 5% from a year ago, driven by continued momentum in securities-based lending. Slide 14 highlights our corporate results, both revenue and expenses declined from a year ago, driven by the sale of our student loan portfolio and divestitures of our Corporate Trust Services business and Wells Fargo Asset Management. These businesses contributed $791 million of revenue in the first quarter of 2021, including the gain on sale of our student loan portfolio and they accounted for approximately $400 million of the decline in expenses compared with a year ago, including the goodwill write-down on the sale of our student loan portfolio.\nWe will now take your questions."

[Operator Instructions]. Please note that today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to John Campbell, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin the conference.\n\nJohn M. Campbell\n\nDirector-Investor Relations, Wells Fargo & Co.\n\nGood morning. Thank you, everyone, for joining our call today where our CEO, Charlie Scharf; and our CFO, Mike Santomassimo, will discuss second quarter results and answer your questions. This call is being recorded. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our second quarter earnings materials, including the release, financial supplement and presentation deck are available on our website at wellsfargo.com. I'd also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings, including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings materials. Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings and the earnings materials available on our website. I will now turn the call over to Charlie.\n\nCharles W. Scharf\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Visa, Inc.\n\nThank you, John, and good morning, everyone. As usual, I'll make some brief comments about our second quarter results and then update you on our priorities. I'll then turn the call over to Mike to review second quarter results in more detail before we take your questions. Let me start with some second quarter highlights. We had solid results in the quarter with revenue, pretax pre-provision profit, diluted earnings per share and ROTCE all higher than a year ago. The revenue growth reflected strong net interest income growth as well as higher non-interest income. While our efficiency ratio improved, and we continue to make progress on our efficiency initiatives, we had modest expense growth from a year ago. Net charge-offs have continued to increase from historical low levels. But overall credit quality was strong and consumer and business balance sheets remain healthy. We increased our allowance for credit losses by $949 million, primarily driven by our office portfolio as well as growth in our credit card portfolio. While we haven't seen significant losses in our office portfolio today, our detailed loan-by-loan review of the portfolio has given us a sense how the next several quarters could play out. We also considered a number of stressed scenarios, all of which informed our actions this quarter.\nMike will discuss this in more detail, but I want to make the point that it is very hard to look at any one statistic and determine the risk in the portfolio. Loss content will be driven by a combination of factors including, but not limited to: Property type, location, lease rates, lease renewal notice states, loan structure and borrower behavior. Most importantly, our CRE teams remain focused on working with our clients for its portfolio surveillance and derisking to minimize loss content. Both commercial and consumer average loans were up from a year ago, but were down from the first quarter as the economy has slowed and we've taken some credit taking actions. Credit card spending remains strong. But the rate of growth has slowed from the outsized growth rates we saw for 2022. Debit card spending was flat from a year ago, with growth in discretionary spend, offset by declines in nondiscretionary spends. Average deposits were down from the first quarter, driven by lower consumer deposits, while the decline in commercial deposits slowed. Now let me update you on progress we've made on our strategic priorities, starting with our risk and control work. Regulatory pressure on banks with long-standing issues such as ours continues to grow, and as such, our continued intensive effort to complete the build-out of an appropriate risk and control framework for a company of our size and complexity is critical.\nI continue to emphasize that this is our top priority and will remain so. And that while we have implemented substantial portions of the work required, we have more implementation to do as well as work to make sure the changes operate effectively over time. As I said before, we remain at risk of further regulatory actions until the work is complete. While we're devoting all necessary resources to our risk and control work, we're also continuing to invest in our business to better serve our customers and help drive growth. Our consumer customers have continued to increase their use of our mobile app. We added over 1 million mobile active customers over the past year and mobile logins increased 9% from a year ago. Fargo, our new AI-powered virtual assistant is now live on our mobile app for all consumer customers. Since launching at the end of April, our customers have interacted with Fargo over 4 million times. We've continued to make important hires, bringing new expertise to Wells Fargo in businesses we are looking to grow. We named Barry Simmons as the new Head of National Sales and Wealth and Investment Management will be critical in our efforts to better serve clients and help advisers grow their business. We also continued to attract veteran bankers in corporate and investment banking, hiring new managing directors in our banking division in priority growth areas, including a co-head of global mergers and acquisitions, co-head of financial institutions, and new heads of financial sponsors, equity capital markets, health care and technology, media and telecom.\nWe also continue to focus on better serving our communities. We announced a 10-year strategic partnership with TD JX Group that could result in up to $1 billion in capital and financing from Wells Fargo to drive economic vitality and inclusivity in communities across America. The Wells Fargo Foundation were $7.5 million to Habitat for Humanity to build and repair more than 360 homes nationwide. We've worked with Habitat for Humanity for nearly 3 decades and donated more than $129 million since 2010. Wells Fargo signed on as the first anchor funder of redose U.S. home initiative to create 4 million new Latino homeowners by 2030. We provided the initial grants to start a fund launched by fintech below ALIS to improve access to credit and capital for small business owners who are members of underserved groups, including women. We continue to open hope inside centers on Wells Fargo branches, including 6 during the first half of 2023, with plans to reach 20 markets by the end of this year. The centers help empower community members to achieve their financial goals through financial education workshops and free one-on-one coaching. We published our 2023 diversity, equity and inclusion report, which highlights the progress we've made in our DE&I strategy and initiatives both inside our company and the communities where we live and work.\nHowever, we have more work to do to achieve enduring results that will require for long-term commitments. Looking ahead, the U.S. economy continues to perform better than many expected. And although there will likely be continued economic slowing and uncertainty remains, it is quite possible the range of scenarios will narrow over the next few quarters. This year's Federal Reserve stress test affirmed that we remain in a strong capital position, reflecting the value of our franchise and benefits of our operating model. This capital strength allows us to serve our customers' financial needs, while continuing to proudly return excess capital to our shareholders. As we previously announced, we expect to increase our third quarter common stock dividend by 17% to $0.35 per share, subject to approval by the company's Board of Directors at its regularly scheduled meeting later this month. We've repurchased $8 billion of common stock during the first half of this year and the stress test results demonstrated that we have the capacity to continue to repurchase common stock. Regulators have signaled that the Basel III endgame proposal, which could be out as soon as this summer will include higher capital requirements that would be skewed to the country's largest banks. While there's some speculation that capital requirements could increase by 20%, we don't know what the impact will be to Wells Fargo.\nHowever, we do expect our capital requirements will increase. While any changes to regulatory capital requirements are expected to be phased in gradually over several years. We are considering the potential impact in contemplating the amount of our future repurchases. Our balance sheet is strong. We've increased and remained focused on increasing our earnings capacity and continue to like our competitive position. We remain prepared for a variety of scenarios and our steadfast commitment to our risk and control build-out, coupled with our continued focus on financial and credit risk management allows us to support our customers throughout economic cycles. I will now turn the call over to Mike.\n\nMichael P. Santomassimo\n\nSenior EVP & CFO, The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation\n\nThank you, Charlie, and good morning, everyone. Net income for the second quarter was $4.9 billion or $1.25 per diluted common share, both up from a year ago, reflecting the progress we are making on improving our performance, which I'll highlight throughout the call. Starting with capital liquidity on Slide 3. Our CET1 ratio was 10.7%, down approximately 10 basis points from the first quarter. During the second quarter, we repurchased $4 billion in common stock, and as Charlie highlighted, subject to Board approval, we expect to increase our common stock dividend in the third quarter. Our CET1 ratio was 1.5 percentage points above our current regulatory minimum plus buffers and was 1.8 percentage points above our expected new regulatory minimum plus buffer starting in the fourth quarter of this year. While we expect to repurchase more common stock this year, we believe continuing to maintain significant excess capital is appropriate until there is more clarity on the new capital requirements that Charlie highlighted. Our liquidity position remains strong in the second quarter with our liquidity coverage ratio approximately 23 percentage points above the regulatory minimum. Turning to credit quality on Slide 5. Overall, credit quality remained strong, but as expected, net loan charge-offs continue to increase from historically low levels and were 32 basis points of average loans in the second quarter.\nCommercial net loan charge-offs increased $137 million from the first quarter to 15 basis points of average loans. Approximately half of the increase was in Commercial Banking where the losses were borrower-specific with little signs of systematic weakness across the portfolio. The rest of the increase was driven by higher losses in commercial real estate, primarily in the office portfolio. I'll share some more details on the CRE office exposure on the next slide. Consumer net loan charge-offs increased modestly, up $23 million from the first quarter to 58 basis points of average loans. The increase primarily came from the credit card portfolio as residential mortgage loans continue to have net recoveries and auto losses declined. While consumer credit performance remained solid overall, and we've continued to take incremental credit exciting actions across the portfolios, we expect consumer net loan charge-offs will continue to gradually increase. Nonperforming assets increased 14% from the first quarter as lower nonaccrual loans across the consumer portfolios were more than offset by higher commercial nonaccrual loans, primarily in the commercial real estate portfolio. Our allowance for credit losses increased $949 million in the second quarter, primarily from commercial real estate office loans as well as for higher credit card balances.\nWe've updated Slide 6, which highlights our commercial real estate portfolio. We had $154.3 billion of commercial real estate loans outstanding at the end of the second quarter with $33.1 billion of office loans, which were down modestly from the first quarter and represented 3% of our total loans outstanding. The office market continues to be weak and the composition of our office portfolio is relatively consistent with what we shared with you in the first quarter. As Charlie mentioned, our CRE teams are focused on surveillance and derisking, which includes reducing exposures and closely monitoring at risk loans. This quarter, we added a table to this slide that breaks down our CRE office exposure in the context of our broader CRE portfolio. As the slide shows, our office loans at the end of the second quarter were primarily in corporate investment banking and that is also where we had the most nonaccrual loans in the highest level of allowance for credit losses. Last quarter, we disclosed for the first time the allowance for credit losses coverage ratio for the office portfolio in the corporate investment bank, which increased from 5.7% at the end of the first quarter to 8.8% at the end of the second quarter. This quarter, we are also providing our allowance for credit losses for our total CRE office portfolio, which was 6.6% at the end of the second quarter, up from 4.4% at the end of the first quarter.\nAs we've highlighted last quarter, we're providing this data to give you more insight into the portfolio, but each property situation is different, and there are many variables that can determine performance, which is why we regularly review this portfolio on a loan-by-loan basis. For example, we have properties that are experiencing increased vacancies where borrowers have decided to inject equity and make investments to improve the property even in cities with more difficult fundamentals. We also have properties that are well leased to performing, but borrowers need health refinancing. In those situations, we are working with farmers to restructure, which in many cases, include some pay down of the balance. There are also situations that result in a sale or worked out of the asset. We will continue to closely monitor this portfolio, but as has been the case in prior cycles, this will likely play out over an extended period of time as we actively work with borrowers to help resolve issues that they may be facing. On Slide 7, we highlight loans and deposits. Average loans were relatively stable in the first quarter and were up 2% from a year ago, driven by higher commercial and industrial loans and commercial banking and credit card loans. I'll highlight specific drivers when discussing our operating segment results. Average loan yields increased 247 basis points from a year ago and 30 basis points from the first quarter due to the higher interest rate environment.\nAverage deposits declined 7% from a year ago, predominantly driven by deposit outflows and in our consumer wealth businesses, reflecting continued consumer spending and customers reallocating cash into higher-yielding alternatives. While down from a year ago, average commercial deposits were relatively stable from the first quarter and average deposits grew in Corporate and Investment Banking. As expected, our average deposit costs continued to increase, up 30 basis points from the first quarter to 113 basis points with higher deposit costs across all operating segments in response to the rising interest rates. Our mix of noninterest-bearing deposits declined from 32% in the first quarter to 30% in the second quarter but remained above pre-pandemic levels. Turning to net interest income on Slide 8. Second quarter net interest income was $13.2 billion, up 29% from a year ago as we continued to benefit from the impact of higher rates. The $173 million decline from the first quarter was primarily due to lower deposit balances, partially offset by one additional day in the quarter. At the beginning of the year, we expected full year net interest income to grow by approximately 10% compared with 2022. We currently expect full year 2023 net interest income to increase approximately 14% compared with 2022.\nThere are a variety of factors that we've considered in our expectations for the rest of the year. We are assuming modest growth in loans with some additional deposit outflows and migration from noninterest-bearing to interest-bearing deposits as well as continued deposit repricing, including competitive pricing on commercial deposits. Additionally, we were using recent -- the recent rate curve, which is shown on the slide. As a reminder, many of the factors driving net interest income are uncertain, and we will need to see how each of these assumptions plays out during the remainder of the year. Turning to expenses on Slide 9. Noninterest expense grew $125 million or 1% from a year ago. At the beginning of the year, we expected our full year 2023 noninterest expense, excluding operating losses to be approximately $50.2 billion. We currently expect our full year 2020 noninterest expense, excluding operating losses to be approximately $51 billion. The increase includes higher severance expense due to actions we have taken and plan to take in 2023 and as attrition has been slower than expected. Of note, we've reduced head count each quarter since the third quarter of 2020 and headcount declined 1% from the first quarter and 4% from a year ago. As a reminder, we have outstanding litigation, regulatory and customer remediation matters that could impact operating losses.\nTurning to our operating segments, starting with Consumer Banking and lending on Slide 10. Consumer and Small Business Banking revenue increased 19% from a year ago as higher net interest income, driven by the impact of higher interest rates was partially offset by lower deposit-related fees driven by the overdraft policy changes we rolled out last year. We continue to reduce the underlying cost to run the business as customers migrate to digital, including mobile. We've reduced our number of branches by 4% and branch staffing by 10% from a year ago. Home Lending revenue declined 13% from a year ago, driven by lower net interest income due to loan spread compression and lower mortgage originations. We continue to reduce headcount in the second quarter, down 37% from a year ago, and we expect that staffing levels will further decline during the second half of the year. Credit card revenue increased 1% from a year ago due to higher loan balances. Payment rates were down for a year ago, but have been stable over the last 3 quarters and remained above pre-pandemic levels. New account growth remained strong, up 17% from a year ago, and importantly, the quality of the new accounts continue to be better than what we were booking historically.\nAuto revenue declined 13% from a year ago, driven by the continued loan spread compression and lower loan balances. Personal lending revenue was up 17% from a year ago due to higher loan allowances. Turning to some key business drivers on Slide 11. Mortgage originations declined 77% from a year ago and increased 18% from the first quarter, reflecting seasonality. We funded our last correspondent loan in the second quarter with our current focus being serving our paying customers as well as borrowers in minority communities. The size of our auto portfolio has declined for 5 consecutive quarters and balances were down 7% at the end of the second quarter compared to a year ago. Origination volume declined 11% from a year ago, reflecting credit tightening actions as well as continued price competition. As Charlie highlighted, debit card spend was flat in the second quarter compared to a year ago, spending on fuel due to lower gas prices, home improvement and travel at the largest declines compared to last year. Credit card spending continued to be strong and was up 13% from a year ago. Growth rates were stable throughout the second quarter with fuel the only category down year-over-year. Turning to Commercial Banking results on Slide 12. The Middle Market banking revenue increased 51% from a year ago due to the impact of higher interest rates and higher loan balances.\nAsset-based lending and leasing revenue increased 13% year-over-year, primarily due to higher loan balances. Average loan balances were up 12% in the second quarter compared to a year ago, driven by new customer growth and higher line utilization. Average loan balances have grown for 8 consecutive quarters and the pace of growth has slowed. Average loans were up 1% from the first quarter with loan growth in asset-based lending and leasing driven by seasonally higher inventory levels, while middle market banking loans were flat. Turning to Corporate Investment Banking on Slide 13. Banking revenue increased 37% from a year ago driven by stronger treasury management results, reflecting the impact of higher interest rates and higher lending revenue. The growth in investment banking fees from a year ago reflected write-downs taken in the second quarter of 2022 on unfunded leveraged finance movements. Commercial real estate revenue grew 26% from a year ago, driven by the impact of higher interest rates and higher loan balances. Markets revenue increased 29% from a year ago, driven by the higher trading results across most asset classes. Our strong trading results during the first half of the year were driven by underlying market conditions and also reflected the benefit of our investments in technology and talent, which have allowed us to broaden our client franchise and generate more trading flows.\nAverage loans were down 2% from a year ago and 1% from the first quarter. The decline in the first quarter was driven by banking, reflecting a combination of slow demand and modestly lower line utilization. On Slide 14, Wealth and Investment Management revenue was down 2% compared to a year ago, driven by a decline in asset-based fees due to lower market valuations. Growth in net interest income from a year ago was driven by the impact of higher rates partially offset by lower deposit balances as customers continue to reallocate cash into higher-yielding alternatives. However, outflows into cash alternatives slowed in the second quarter. As a reminder, the majority of win advisory assets are priced at the beginning of the quarter, so second quarter results reflected the market valuations as of April 1, which were down from a year ago. Asset-based fees in the third quarter will reflect higher market valuations as of July 1. Average loans were down 3% from a year ago, primarily due to a decline in securities-based lending. Now Slide 15 highlights our corporate results. Revenue increased $751 million from a year ago, driven by the impact of higher interest rates and lower impairments of equity securities in our affiliated venture capital and private equity businesses.\nIn summary, our results in the second quarter reflected continued improvement in our earnings capacity. We grew revenue and had strong growth in pretax provision profit. As expected, our net charge-offs continue to slowly increase from historical lows as our allowance for credit losses increased. We are closely monitoring our portfolios and taking credit tightening actions where we believe appropriate. Our capital levels remain strong, and we continue to repurchase common stock. We will now take your questions."

[Operator Instructions] Please note that today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to John Campbell, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin the conference.\n\nJohn M. Campbell\n\nDirector-Investor Relations, Wells Fargo & Co.\n\nGood morning. Thank you for joining our call today by our CEO, Charlie Scharf; and our CFO, Mike Santomassimo, who'll discuss first quarter results and answer your questions. This call is being recorded. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our first quarter earnings materials, including the release, financial supplement, and presentation deck are available on our website at wellsfargo.com.\nI'd also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings, including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings materials. Information about any non-GAAP financial reference, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings and the earnings materials available on our website. I'll now turn the call over to Charlie.\n\nCharles W. Scharf\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Visa, Inc.\n\nThanks, John. I'll make some brief comments about our first quarter results and then update you on our priorities. I'll then turn the call over to Mike to review our results in more detail before we take your questions.\nLet me start with some first quarter highlights. Our solid results reflect the progress we're making to improve and diversify our financial performance and the continued strength in the U.S. economy. It's gratifying to see the investments we're making across the franchise contributing to higher revenue versus the fourth quarter as an increase in noninterest income more than offset an expected decline in net interest income. Noninterest income also benefited from higher equity markets, which benefited our Wealth and Investment Management business.\nNet charge-offs were higher than a year ago as expected and stable from the fourth quarter. Credit trends remain generally consistent. Consumer delinquencies continue to perform as we've forecasted, and year-over-year growth in consumer spend remains consistent with prior quarters. In our commercial portfolios, the weakness we see continues to be in certain commercial office properties, but our expectations have not significantly changed versus what we anticipated last quarter. Mike will discuss the specific items that drove an increase in expenses from a year ago, but we continued to execute on our efficiency initiatives, including reducing headcount, which has declined every quarter since the third quarter of 2020.\nAverage commercial and consumer loans were both down from the fourth quarter as higher rates are impacting demand and we are continuing to reduce our exposure in certain portfolios. Average deposits were relatively stable from the fourth quarter as growth in interest-bearing deposits offset lower noninterest-bearing deposits. Our capital position remains strong and returning excess capital to shareholders remains a priority. As we stated on our last earnings call, we expect to repurchase more common stock this year than we did in 2023. In the first quarter, we repurchased a total of $6.1 billion in common stock, and our average common shares outstanding declined 6% from a year ago.\nNow let me update you on the progress we're making on our strategic priorities, starting with our risk and control work. Earlier this year, the OCC terminated a consent order issued in 2016 regarding sales practices misconduct. The closure of this order was an important milestone as it is confirmation that we operate much differently today around sales practices. As I repeatedly said, our risk and control work remains our top priority and closing consent orders is an important sign of progress.\nThis is the sixth consent order that our regulators have terminated since I joined Wells Fargo in 2019. Building our risk and control framework is a continuous ongoing effort, and as we implement changes, we track effectiveness along the way. The numerous internal metrics we track show that the work is clearly improving our control environment, and we see that we are completing interim deliverables, but we will not be satisfied until all of our work is complete. So it will remain our top priority and our approach will not change.\nAs I highlighted in my recent annual letter, we have added approximately 10,000 people across numerous risk and control-related groups, and we're spending over $2.5 billion more per year than in 2018 in these areas, and we are a stronger, better company for our customers, communities, and employees. While we're moving forward with confidence, I will repeat what I've said in the past. Regulatory pressures on banks' long-standing issues such as ours is high, and until we complete our work and until it is validated by our regulators, we remain at risk of further regulatory actions.\nAdditionally, as we implement heightened controls and oversight, new issues could be found and these may result in regulatory actions. At the same time we're making progress on our risk and control work, we're executing on our strategic priorities to better serve our customers and help drive higher returns over time. We continue to introduce attractive new products as we build our credit card business. Last month, we launched Autograph Journey designed for frequent travelers who could earn points wherever they book travel. Our new product offerings continue to drive strong credit card spend, up approximately $5 billion or 14% from a year ago.\nWe continue to make investments in talent and technology to strengthen Corporate and Investment Banking. More than 50 new senior hires have joined our CIB since 2019, with many of these in key coverage and product groups within banking. In February, Doug Braunstein who has more than 35 years of industry experience, joined Wells Fargo as a Vice Chairman. Doug is a world-class banker, and he's working alongside the great team he's assembled to continue to grow the franchise. In addition, given the breadth of Doug's experience, he's also providing counsel on broader business issues beyond client development.\nAs we look forward, it's always helpful to be grounded in the facts. We continue to see strength in the U.S. economy. Spending patterns of consumers using our debit and credit cards remain generally consistent and continue to grow year-over-year. Consumer credit is performing as we expect, wholesale credit continues to perform well, and our views around commercial real estate have not significantly changed since last quarter. These are all positives. In addition, we remain committed and confident in our ability to increase efficiencies across the enterprise. And areas we have targeted for investment such as credit card, investment banking and trading are performing well.\nWe are beginning to see early signs of share and fee growth, which will be important as we diversify our revenues and reduce net interest income as a percentage of revenue. And we remain bullish on opportunities across our other businesses, again, more positives. Having said that, markets and rates will likely remain volatile. And as risk managers, we are prepared if trends were to change. We've historically managed credit through multiple cycles and believe that the actions we've taken over the last several years position us well. We have strong capital and liquidity positions.\nAs we're building many of our businesses, we have done so within a consistent level of risk appetite. And our business model and franchise value differentiates us from most of who we compete with, regardless of the environment. So what does all of this mean for our outlook? Simply said, our views haven't changed from last quarter. While we could look at specific data points on a specific date and alter our guidance, there is not enough of a consistent pattern to change our views, but what we see is helpful.\nOur focus remains the same. We are transforming Wells Fargo and are investing to build a well-controlled, best-growing and higher-returning company while we work to become more efficient. I'm pleased with the progress we've made, and I'm optimistic about the future opportunities ahead. I will now turn the call over to Mike.\n\nMichael P. Santomassimo\n\nSenior EVP & CFO, The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation\n\nThank you, Charlie, and good morning, everyone. Net income for the first quarter was $4.6 billion or $1.20 per diluted common share. Our first quarter results included $284 million or $0.06 per share for the FDIC special assessment as a result of the regional bank failures last year. Recall last quarter, our results included $1.9 billion for the special assessment, and this additional amount reflects recent updates provided by the FDIC, including potential recoveries, which were highlighted in their disclosure. The ultimate amount of our special assessment may continue to change as the FDIC determines the actual losses and recoveries to the deposit insurance fund.\nTurning to Slide 4. Net interest income declined $1.1 billion or 8% from a year ago due to the impact of higher interest rates on funding costs, including the impact of customers migrating to higher-yielding deposit products as well as lower loan balances, partially offset by higher yields on earning assets. First quarter results were largely as expected with loan balances a little lower and deposit balances in the businesses a little higher than our expectations. Our full year net interest income guidance has not changed from last quarter, and we still expect 2024 net interest income to be approximately 7% to 9% lower than 2023. We also continue to expect net interest income will trough towards the end of this year. It is still early in the year, and ultimately, the amount of net interest income we earn will depend on a variety of factors, many of which are uncertain, including deposit balances, mix and pricing, the absolute level of interest rates and the shape of the yield curve and loan demand.\nOn Slide 5, we highlight loans and deposits. Average loans were down from both the fourth quarter and a year ago. Credit card loans continue to grow, almost other categories declined. I'll highlight specific drivers when discussing our operating segment results. Average loan yields increased 69 basis points from a year ago to over 6%, reflecting the higher interest rate environment. Average deposits declined 1% from a year ago, reflecting lower deposits in our consumer businesses as customers continued spending and reallocating cash into higher-yielding alternatives.\nWhile growth in average deposits from the fourth quarter was modest, we have grown deposits in our commercial businesses for 2 consecutive quarters, which reflected our success in attracting clients' operational deposits. Period-end deposits included in the chart on the bottom of the page were up 2% from the fourth quarter, but some of this growth reflected a temporary increase driven by a quarter end that was on a payday and a holiday. While the pace of growth slowed, our average deposit costs continued to increase as expected, rising 16 basis points from the fourth quarter to 174 basis points with higher deposit costs across most operating segments. Our mix of deposits continue to shift with our percentage of noninterest-bearing deposits declining to 26%.\nTurning to noninterest income on Slide 6. We were pleased with the growth in noninterest income across all of our business segments. Growth in noninterest income more than offset lower net interest income, reflecting a revenue growth from both the fourth quarter and a year ago. Noninterest income was up 17% from a year ago with strong growth in investment advisory fees and brokerage commissions, deposit and lending-related fees, trading and investment banking fees. As Charlie highlighted, we benefited from market conditions as well as the investments we've been making in our businesses. I will highlight the specific drivers of this growth when discussing the segment results.\nTurning to expenses on Slide 7. First quarter noninterest expense increased 5% from a year ago, driven by higher operating losses, the FDIC special assessment, an increase in revenue-related compensation predominantly due to higher investment and advisory fees in our Wealth and Investment Management business, and higher technology and equipment expense. These increases were partially offset by the impact of efficiency initiatives, including lower professional and outside services expense, which declined 10% from a year ago. The higher operating losses were driven by customer remediation accruals for a small number of historical matters that we are working hard to get behind us.\nThe increase in personnel expense from the fourth quarter was driven by approximately $650 million of seasonally higher expenses in the first quarter, including payroll taxes, restricted stock expense for retirement-eligible employees and 401(k) matching contributions. Not including expense for the FDIC special assessment in the first quarter, our full year 2024 noninterest expense guidance is unchanged and is still expected to be approximately $52.6 billion.\nHowever, we continue to watch a couple of items. Our guidance included $1.3 billion of operating losses for the year, which we still believe is a reasonable estimate even with a higher level of operating losses in the first quarter. However, we have outstanding litigation, regulatory and customer remediation matters that could impact operating losses during the remainder of the year. Also, market valuations remain at current levels or move higher, that would increase investment in advisory fees and revenue-related compensation could be higher than we assumed in our expense guidance for this year, which would be a good thing. We'll continue to update you as the year progresses.\nTurning to credit quality on Slide 8. Net loan charge-offs declined 3 basis points from the fourth quarter to 50 basis points of average loans. Credit performance trends were consistent with what we saw last quarter. The decline reflected lower commercial net loan charge-offs, which were down $131 million from the fourth quarter to 25 basis points of average loans. The reduction was driven by lower losses in our commercial real estate office portfolio. We did not see further deterioration in the performance of our CRE office portfolio versus the fourth quarter, and therefore, our expectations have not changed. We continue to expect additional losses in the coming quarters. However, the amounts will likely be uneven and episodic.\nConsumer net loan charge-offs continue to increase as expected and were up $28 million from the fourth quarter to 84 basis points of average loans. While auto losses continue to decline, benefiting from the tightening actions we implemented starting in late 2021, credit card losses increased in line with our expectations. Nonperforming assets declined 2% from the fourth quarter, driven by the lower CRE office nonaccruals, reflecting the realization of losses and pay downs in the quarter.\nMoving to Slide 9. Based on the consistent credit trends I noted before, our allowance for credit losses was down modestly, driven by declines for commercial real estate and auto loans, partially offset by a higher allowance for credit card loans. The table on the page shows the allowance for credit losses coverage ratio for commercial real estate, including the breakdown of the office portfolio. We didn't increase our allowance for this portfolio in the first quarter, and the coverage ratio in our CIB commercial real estate office portfolio of 11% was stable compared with the fourth quarter.\nTurning to capital and liquidity on Slide 10. Our capital position remains strong, and our CET1 ratio of 11.2% continue to be well above our 8.9% regulatory minimum plus buffers. We repurchased $6.1 billion of common stock in the first quarter. While the amount of stock we repurchase each quarter will vary, we continue to expect to repurchase more common stock this year than we did in 2023.\nTurning to our operating segments, starting with Consumer Banking and Lending on Slide 11. Consumer, Small and Business Banking revenue declined 4% from a year ago, driven by our lower deposit balances. We continue to invest in talent, technology, and branches to improve the customer experience. Our branches are becoming more advice-focused with teller transactions declining while banker visits have increased. We are modernizing and optimizing the branch network. The number of branches declined 6% from a year ago, while at the same time, we are accelerating the refurbishment of our branch network.\nIn addition, the enhancements we are making to our mobile app continue to drive momentum in mobile adoption, and we surpassed 30 million active mobile customers in the first quarter, up 6% from a year ago. Mobile logins also reached a milestone, surpassing 2 billion logins for the first time in the first quarter, up 18% from a year ago.\nHome lending revenue was stable from a year ago as higher mortgage banking income was offset by lower net interest income as loan balances continued to decline. Credit card revenue increased 6% from a year ago, driven by the higher loan balances. Payment rates remained relatively stable compared with the fourth quarter and were above pre-pandemic levels. Auto revenue declined 23% from a year ago, driven by continued loans rate compression and lower loan balances. Personal lending revenue was up 7% from a year ago and included the impact of higher loan balances.\nTurning to some key business drivers on Slide 12. Retail mortgage originations declined 38% from a year ago, reflecting the progress we've made on our strategic objective to simplify the business as well as the decline in the mortgage market. We also made significant progress in reducing the amount of third-party mortgage loans we service, down 21% from a year ago. We also continued to reduce the headcount in home lending, which was down 33% from a year ago.\nBalances in our auto portfolio were down 12% compared to last year. Origination volume declined 18% from a year ago, reflecting credit tightening actions, but increased 24% from a slow fourth quarter. Debit card spend increased 4% from a year ago with growth in most categories except for fuel and travel. Credit card spending remained strong. It was up 14% from a year ago. All categories grew with stronger growth in nondiscretionary spend. New account growth continued to be strong, up 12% from last year.\nTurning to Commercial Banking results on Slide 13. Middle Market Banking revenue was down 4% from a year ago, driven by lower net interest income due to higher deposit costs, partially offset by higher deposit-related fees. Asset-Based Lending and Leasing revenue decreased 7% year-over-year and included lower revenue from equity investments. Average loan balances were stable compared to a year ago as growth in Asset-Based Lending and Leasing was offset by declines in Middle Market Banking. Weaker loan demand reflected the impact of clients being cautious, given the higher rate environment and the anticipation of lower rates this year as well as some potential uncertainty in an election year.\nTurning to Corporate and Investment Banking on Slide 14. Banking revenue increased 5% from a year ago, driven by higher Investment Banking revenue due to increased activity across all products. Our results benefited from the areas where we have had strength for some time such as investment-grade debt capital markets and from the talent we've been attracting into the business. While it is still early, we are encouraged by the green shoots we are seeing. Commercial real estate revenue was down 7% from a year ago and included the impact of lower loan balances. Markets revenue increased 2% from a year ago, driven by continued strong performance in structured products, credit products and foreign exchange. Our trading results continue to benefit from market conditions, and the investments we have made in technology and talent to round out the business have enabled us to produce strong results even as market dynamics have changed.\nAverage loans declined 4% from a year ago. Banking clients have taken advantage of strong capital markets payout loans. In addition to weak loan demand in commercial real estate, given market conditions, balances also declined due to credit tightening actions we implemented last year, along with our efforts to actively reduce certain property types in the portfolio.\nOn Slide 15, Wealth and Investment Management revenue increased 2% compared to a year ago. Lower net interest income driven by lower deposit balances as customers reallocated cash into higher-yielding alternatives was more than offset by higher asset-based fees due to increased market valuations. While cash alternatives as a percentage of total client assets was higher than a year ago, it has declined in the past 2 quarters as the migration of deposits into cash alternatives has slowed significantly. As a reminder, the majority of WIM advisory assets are priced at the beginning of the quarter, so first quarter results reflected market valuations as of January 1, which were higher from a year ago. Asset-based fees in the second quarter will reflect market valuations as of April 1, which were higher from both a year ago and from January 1.\nSlide 16 highlights our corporate results. Revenue grew from a year ago due to improved results in our affiliated venture capital business on lower impairments. In summary, our results in the first quarter reflected the progress we're making to improve our financial performance. We grew revenue, driven by strong growth in our fee-based businesses. We continue to make progress on our efficiency initiatives. We increased capital return to shareholders and maintained our strong capital position. We'll now take your questions."

(Operator Instructions). Please note that today's call is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the call over to John Campbell, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin the conference.\n\nJohn M. Campbell\n\nDirector of IR, Wells Fargo & Company\n\nGood morning. Thank you for joining our call today where our CEO, Charlie Scharf; and our CFO, Mike Santomassimo, will discuss third quarter results and answer your questions. This call is being recorded.\nBefore we get started, I would like to remind you that our third quarter earnings materials, including the release, financial supplement and presentation deck, are available on our website at wellsfargo.com. I'd also, like, to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings, including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings materials. Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings and the earnings materials available on our website.\nI will now turn the call over to Charlie.\n\nCharles W. Scharf\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Wells Fargo & Company\n\nThanks, John, and good morning, everyone. I'll make some brief comments about our third quarter results, the operating environment, and update you on our priorities. I'll then turn the call over to Mike to review third quarter results in more detail before we take your questions.\nLet me start with the third quarter highlights. Our solid business performance this quarter was significantly impacted by $2 billion or $0.45 per share in operating losses related to litigation, customer remediation and regulatory matters primarily related to a variety of historical matters.\nAs you know, we've been and remain focused on increasing our earnings capacity and see the positive impact of rising interest rates, driving strong net interest income growth and our continued focus on improving operating efficiencies, resulting in lower expenses, excluding operating losses. Credit quality remains strong, and we continue to invest in our technology platforms, digital capabilities and delivering additional products to our customers and clients.\nWhile we're closely monitoring trends with economic conditions expected to weaken given inflation, geopolitical instability, energy price volatility and rising interest rates, our customers continue to be resilient with overall strong credit performance and solid cash flow. When looking at simple averages across the entire consumer portfolio, deposit balances per account decreased from the second quarter, but were still higher than a year ago and remained above pre-pandemic levels.\nHowever, we continue to closely monitor activity by segment for signs of potential stress and for certain cohorts of customers. We've seen average balances steadily decline and are now below pre-pandemic levels, and their debit card spend continues to decline. This is a continuation of what I referenced last quarter, but it's important to note that this remains a small percentage of our total customer base.\nOverall, our consumer deposit customers' health indicators, including cash flow, payroll and overdraft trends, are still not showing elevated risk concerns. Debit card spending remained significantly above pre-pandemic levels and was up 3% in the third quarter compared to a year ago, consistent with the second quarter increase. Entertainment and fuel spending had the largest increases from a year ago, but the recent decline in fuel prices drove fuel spending to decline compared to the second quarter.\nApparel and home improvement spending declined from both the year ago and second quarter. Credit card spend remained strong in the third quarter, up 25% from a year ago, with double-digit increases coming across all spending categories. Spending was up modestly on a linked-quarter basis. So remember, the significant portion of this growth is from our new products, which continued to have strong credit profiles.\nPeriod-end commercial loan balances were stable compared to the second quarter, with continued growth in commercial banking, offset by declines across our businesses in corporate and investment banking. Credit performance remained strong, with net charge-offs and nonaccrual loans continuing to decline from exceptionally low levels. Clients do tell us that they continue to be impacted by persistent inflation, rising interest rates and tight labor market. And while credit quality remains strong, we're actively monitoring inflation-sensitive industries and taking proactive actions where warranted.\nNow, let me update you on the progress we're making on our strategic priorities. We continue to devote significant resources to implementing an appropriate risk and control framework across the company, and this remains our top priority. We continue to make progress and are executing on our plans, but significant work remains.\nAs a reminder, though I'm confident in our ability to complete the work, it remains a significant body of work and the primary focus of the company. We have set high standards for success, and given the long-standing nature of much of our work, we have said that we remain at risk of setbacks until it is complete. Expenses in the quarter reflect these ongoing risks and our efforts to resolve them.\nAs we continue our work to put our historical issues behind us and to address issues that are identified as we advance our risk control infrastructure work, outstanding issues still remain that will likely result in additional expense in the coming quarters, which could be significant. We are working to close these as quickly as possible, and we remain committed to doing right by our customers and working closely with our regulators and others to resolve these matters. We recognize the importance of moving forward, and the expenses in the quarter are representative of these efforts.\nAt the same time, we're implementing changes to better serve our customers and investing in our businesses to help drive growth. As part of the announcement we made earlier this year to limit overdraft-related fees and give customers more options to achieve their financial goals, we implemented extra day grace period of the third quarter, which provides consumer customers an extra business day to cure negative balances and avoid overdraft fees.\nWe also began to roll out early payday, which provides consumer -- customers who are -- who receive eligible direct deposits the ability to access funds up to 2 days earlier than scheduled, further reducing the potential to incur overdrafts. Notably, while this enhancement was rolled out in only 6 states in the third quarter, during the first 2 weeks of offering this enhancement, we provided customers early access to $2 billion in funds from 1.3 million eligible direct deposits.\nAnd we're on track for a fourth quarter rollout of an easy-to-access short-term credit product that will give qualifying customers another option to meet their personal financial needs. These actions build on services that we've introduced over the past several years, including offering an account that does not charge any overdraft fees. We now have over 1.6 million of those clear access banking accounts, up 57% from a year ago.\nAnd as I mentioned last quarter, we've developed a new integrated banking, lending and investment offering that is geared towards the more complex financial needs of our affluent clients called Wells Fargo Premier. During the quarter, we introduced Wells Fargo Premier across our entire branch footprint, initiated a branded digital experience, and launched marketing programs to help affluent customers learn more about how we can better serve them. We'll continue to build the Wells Fargo Premier offering in the -- tucked in the coming quarters.\nIn the third quarter, we continued to launch new APIs, providing our commercial and corporate clients more flexibility and helping them drive efficiencies. For example, we launched a new real-time payment API, allowing clients to send digital requests to a payer that can be approved to easily send a real-time credit transfer. We also launched a virtual card API, which enables clients to create and configure virtual cards for B2B vendor payments and purchases.\nIn our CIB markets businesses, we're accelerating our investment into our electronic trading capabilities across multiple asset classes to better meet the evolving needs of our clients, which is helping to drive strong gains in trading volumes. And we're selectively adding talent in our investment banking coverage and product areas as we focus on leveraging our strong existing relationships to build our fee-based businesses.\nWe also continued to make progress on the environmental, social and governance work that is underway at Wells Fargo. In the third quarter, we published our latest ESG report, which highlights the progress we made in 2021 on our ESG efforts. We consider this work a sustained long-term commitment, and believe Wells Fargo is well positioned to make a difference. We issued our second sustainability bond in the amount of $2 billion that will finance projects and programs, supporting housing affordability, economic opportunity, renewable energy and clean transportation.\nDuring the third quarter, we officially launched a new grant program in Houston, San Diego and Milwaukee to help improve racial equity in home ownership, and we have more markets coming before the end of this year. This is part of the $60 million commitment we made earlier this year through the Wells Fargo Foundation to wealth opportunities restored through home ownership for worth. This effort aims to create 40,000 homeowners of color access -- 40,000 homeowners of color across 8 markets by the end of 2025.\nWe announced a $1 million donation to provide urgent relief to Florida following the aftermath of Hurricane Ian. In addition, customer accommodations and employee support are available to those directly impacted by the storm.\nIn summary, continued high inflation has kept the Federal Reserve aggressive with rate hikes, leading the housing market to slow rapidly and the heightened uncertainty about the economic outlook and geopolitical events caused the financial markets to be volatile. However, labor demand remains robust, consumer balance sheets remain healthy, and customers have capacity to borrow.\nWells Fargo is positioned well as we will continue to benefit from higher rates and ongoing disciplined expense management. Both consumer and business customers remain in a strong financial condition, and we continue to see historically low delinquencies and high payment rates across our portfolios. We're closely monitoring risks related to the continued impact of high inflation and increasing rates as well as the broader geopolitical risks, and we do expect to see increases in delinquencies, and ultimately, credit losses, but the timing remains unclear.\nAs we look forward, we remain bullish on our business opportunities. Our higher operating margins and strong capital ratios have prepared us for a wide range of macroeconomic scenarios. In the third quarter, we increased our common stock dividend by 20% and our CET1 ratio was 10.3%, 110 basis points above our current regulatory minimum, including buffers. We will continue to prudently manage our capital levels to be appropriately prepared for slowing economy and market volatility.\nFinally, I know many of you are interested in our 2023 expectations and our -- and on our next earnings call, we plan to provide our 2023 expense and net interest income outlook, as well as more color on our path to an over the cycle of 15% ROTCE.\nI will now turn the call over to Mike.\n\nMichael P. Santomassimo\n\nSenior EVP & CFO, The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation\n\nThank you, Charlie, and good morning, everyone.\nNet income for the quarter was $3.5 billion or $0.85 per diluted common share. As Charlie highlighted, our results included $2 billion or $0.45 per share of accruals primarily related to a variety of historical matters. These accruals drove our total expenses higher. However, if you exclude operating losses, our expenses would have declined as we continue to execute on our efficiency initiatives. Revenue grew in the third quarter, driven by higher net interest income, while noninterest income also increased from the second quarter. Our effective income tax rate for the third quarter was 20.2%.\nWe highlight capital on Slide 3. Our CET1 ratio is 10.3%, down 6 basis points from the second quarter as the 21 basis point decline from AOCI as well as the impact from dividend payments was nearly offset by our third quarter earnings. Our CET1 ratio remained well above our required regulatory minimum plus buffers, which increased by 10 basis points to 9.2% at the start of the fourth quarter as our new stress capital buffer took effect. As a reminder, our G-SIB surcharge will not increase in 2023.\nWe did not buy back any common stock in the second or third quarters, and we will continue to be prudent regarding the amount and timing of any share repurchases.\nTurning to credit quality on Slide 5. Credit performance remained strong, with only 17 basis points of net charge-offs in the third quarter. However, as expected, losses are slowly increasing from historical lows, and we expect them to continue to normalize towards pre-pandemic levels over time as the Federal Reserve continues to take actions to combat inflation. We are closely monitoring our portfolio for potential risks, and are continuing to take some targeted actions to further tighten underwriting standards.\nCommercial credit performance remained strong across our commercial businesses, with only $6 million of net charge-offs and net recoveries in our commercial real estate portfolio for the third consecutive quarter. We also had net recoveries in our consumer real estate portfolios. However, total consumer net charge-offs increased $72 million from the second quarter to 40 basis points on average loans, driven by an increase in net charge-offs in the auto portfolio.\nHigher loss rates on certain auto loans originated primarily in the latter part of 2021 contributed to the linked quarter increase in charge-offs and delinquent loans in the auto portfolio. Lower loan balances also impacted the loss rate, which started -- we started taking credit tightening actions earlier this year, which have improved the quality of 2022 originations. As a result of these actions, increased pricing competition and continued industry supply chain constraints, the third quarter origination volumes were down over 40% compared to a year ago.\nNonperforming assets declined again in the third quarter and were down $411 million or 7% from the second quarter and down 20% from a year ago. While commercial nonaccruals continued to decline, lower levels of consumer nonaccruals were the primary driver of lower nonperforming assets due to a decrease in residential mortgage nonaccrual loans from the impact of customers' sustained payment performance after exiting COVID-related accommodation programs. Our allowance for credit losses increased $385 million in the third quarter, primarily reflecting loan growth and a less favorable economic environment.\nOn Slide 6, we highlight loans and deposits. Average loans grew 11% from a year ago and 2% from the second quarter. Period-end loans increased for the fifth consecutive quarter, but growth slowed as expected, with commercial loan balances holding relatively stable from the second quarter, while consumer loans grew driven by credit card and first lien residential mortgage loans, partially offset by continued declines in our auto portfolio.\nI'll highlight the specific growth drivers when discussing our operating segment results. Average loan yields increased nearly 100 basis points from a year ago and 76 basis points from the second quarter, reflecting the higher rate environment. Average deposits declined 3% from both the year ago and the second quarter, with declines across our deposit-gathering businesses.\nCompared with the second quarter, Wealth and Investment Management had the largest decline by dollar amount as clients look for higher-yielding alternatives. Declines in our commercial businesses were driven mostly by outflows of nonoperational deposits, which can be more price sensitive and a less stable source of funding. Outflows in consumer and small business banking were driven by continued customer spending and increased outflows from customers seeking higher-yielding products.\nOur average deposit cost increased 10 basis points from the second quarter to 14 basis points. Pricing has been consistent with our expectations, with deposit costs holding relatively stable in Consumer Banking and Lending while trending higher across other businesses. As rates continue to rise, we would expect deposit betas to continue to increase in customer migration from lower-yielding to higher-yielding deposit products to also increase.\nTurning to net interest income in Slide 7. Third quarter net interest income increased $3.2 billion or 36% from a year ago and $1.9 billion or 19% from the second quarter. The growth from the second quarter was primarily driven by the impact of higher rates, which increased earning asset yields and reduced premium amortization from mortgage-backed securities. We also benefit from higher loan balances and 1 additional day in the quarter. These benefits were partially offset by higher funding costs.\nIn the first 9 months of this year, net interest income was up 19% compared with a year ago. We currently expect full year 2022 net interest income to be approximately 24% higher than a year ago, with fourth quarter 2022 net interest income expected to be approximately $12.9 billion.\nTurning to expenses on Slide 8. The increase in noninterest expense from both a year ago and from the second quarter was due to the higher operating losses that I highlighted earlier. Excluding operating losses, other noninterest expense was down 5% from a year ago as we had lower revenue-related compensation, expenses related to divestitures came out of the run rate, and we continue to make progress on our efficiency initiatives. Excluding operating losses, our expenses would have been down on a year-over-year basis for 6 consecutive quarters.\nAnother way you can see the impact of our efficiency initiatives is through lower head count, which has declined for 9 consecutive quarters and was down 6% from a year ago. We've also reduced professional and outside services expense by 10% and occupancy expense by 4% during the first 9 months this year. The higher level of operating losses in the third quarter will cause us to exceed our $51.5 billion expense outlook for 2022, which included $1.3 billion of operating losses for the full year. We currently expect our fourth quarter other expenses, excluding operating losses, to be approximately $12.3 billion.\nAs Charlie highlighted, outstanding litigation, customer remediation and regulatory matters still remain -- that will still remain, and will likely result in additional expense in the coming quarters, which could be significant.\nTurning to our operating segments, starting with Consumer Banking and Lending on Slide 9. Consumer and small business banking revenue increased 29% from a year ago driven by the impact of higher interest rates and higher deposit balances. Deposit-related fees were impacted by the overdraft policy changes we rolled out earlier this year, which eliminated non-sufficient funds and some other fees. The extra day grace period launched in the beginning of August and early payday began in select states in mid-September, so we would expect our deposit-related fees to decline further in the fourth quarter.\nIndustry mortgage rates have increased over 300 basis points since the beginning of the year and ended the quarter at the highest level since 2007, driving weekly mortgage applications as measured by the Mortgage Bankers Association to a 25-year low at quarter end. As a result, our Home Lending revenue declined 52% from a year ago, driven by lower mortgage originations and gain on sale margins, as well as lower revenue from the re-securitization of loans purchased from securitization pools. While the mortgage market adjusts to lower volumes, we expect it to remain challenging in the near term, and it's possible that we have a further decline in the mortgage banking revenue in the fourth quarter when originations are seasonally slower.\nWe continue to remove excess capacity to align with the reduced demand and expect these adjustments will continue over the next couple of quarters. Credit card revenue was up 8% from a year ago due to higher loan balances, which benefited from higher point-of-sale volume and new product launches. Auto revenue declined 5% from a year ago, driven by loan spread compression and partially offset by higher loan balances. And Personal Lending was 9% from a year ago due to higher loan balances driven by growth in origination volumes.\nTurning to some key business drivers on Slide 10. Mortgage originations declined 59% from a year ago and 37% in the second quarter, with declines in both correspondent and retail originations. Refinances as a percentage of total originations declined to 16% in the third quarter. Average home lending loan balances grew 2% from the second quarter, driven by growth in our non-conforming portfolio. I already highlighted the drivers of decline in auto originations.\nSo turning to debit card. While debit card spend increased 3% from a year ago, spending declined 2% from the second quarter. As Charlie highlighted, credit card point-of-sale purchase volumes were up 25% from a year ago, with the largest percentage increases in fuel and travel. Average balances were up 21% from a year ago, reflecting the strong point of sale volume, which also benefited from the launch of new products, with new accounts up 11%. We will continue to remain disciplined in our underwriting of new credit card accounts.\nTurning to Commercial Banking results on Slide 11. Middle Market Banking revenue increased 54% from a year ago, driven by higher net interest income due to the impact of higher rates and higher loan balances. Asset-Based Lending and Leasing revenue increased 27% from a year ago, driven by higher net gains from equity securities, higher loan balances and higher revenue from renewable energy investments.\nNoninterest expense increased 9% from a year ago, primarily driven by higher operating costs and higher operating losses. Average loan balances have grown for 5 consecutive quarters, and were up 17% from a year ago. Line utilization rates were fairly stable relative to the second quarter. Inflation and our customers' continued efforts to rebuild inventory as supply chain challenges remain drove the growth in Asset-Based Lending and Leasing. Loan growth in the Middle Market Banking continued to come from larger clients, which more than offset declines from smaller clients.\nTurning to Corporate and Investment Banking on Slide 12. Banking revenue increased 28% from a year ago driven by stronger treasury management results, reflecting the impact of higher interest rates as well as higher loan balances. Investment banking fees declined from a year ago, reflecting lower market activity. Compared with the second quarter, the increase in investment banking fees was due to the write-down of unfunded leveraged finance commitments last quarter.\nCommercial real estate revenue grew 29% from a year ago, driven by higher loan balances, the impact of higher interest rates as well as improved commercial mortgage bank-backed securities gain on sale margins.\nMarkets revenue increased 6% from a year ago, reflecting volatility and strong client-demanded equities, rates and commodities and foreign exchange trading. Average loans grew 19% from a year ago, with broad-based growth across our businesses to fund clients' working capital needs, but the pace of growth slowed in the third quarter with average balances up 3% and period-end loans down 3% from the second quarter.\nOn Slide 13, Wealth and Investment Management revenue grew 1% from a year ago as the increase in net interest income driven by the impact of higher rates offset the decline in asset-based fees driven by lower market valuations. As a reminder, the majority of WIM advisory assets are priced at the beginning of the quarter, so third quarter results reflected the lower market valuations as of July 1. And while the S&P 500 and fixed income indices declined again in the third quarter, the decrease was not as steep as the second quarter decline. So while there will be another step down in asset-based fees in the fourth quarter, it will be less significant than the third quarter decline.\nExpenses decreased 4% from a year ago due to lower revenue-related compensation. Average loans increased 3% from a year ago driven by continued momentum in securities-based lending.\nSlide 14 highlights our Corporate results. Both revenue and expenses were impacted by the divestitures last year of our Corporate Trust services business and Wells Fargo Asset Management. These businesses contributed $459 million of revenue and accounted for approximately $305 million of expense in the third quarter of 2021. Revenue also declined from a year ago due to lower equity gains in our affiliated venture capital and private equity businesses, and given current market conditions, we don't expect equity gains to improve in the fourth quarter. Expenses increased from a year ago due to higher operating losses.\nIn summary, although the high level of operating losses we had in the quarter significantly impacted our results, the underlying results in the quarter continue to reflect our improving earnings capacity. We had strong net interest income growth from rising rates, and if you exclude operating losses, our expenses would have declined as we continued to execute on our efficiency initiatives. Both our credit performance and capital levels remain strong.\nWe will now take your questions."

[Operator Instructions] Please note that today's call is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the call over to John Campbell, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin the conference.\n\nJohn M. Campbell\n\nDirector-Investor Relations, Wells Fargo & Co.\n\nGood morning. Thank you for joining our call today where our CEO, Charlie Scharf; and our CFO, Mike Santomassimo, will discuss first quarter results and answer your questions. This call is being recorded.\nBefore we get started, I would like to remind you that our first quarter earnings materials, including the release, financial supplement and presentation deck are available on our website at wellsfargo.com.\nI'd also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings, including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings materials. Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings and the earnings materials available on our website.\nI will now turn the call over to Charlie.\n\nCharles W. Scharf\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Visa, Inc.\n\nThanks, John. I'll make some brief comments about our first quarter results and update you on our priorities. I'll then turn the call over to Mike to review first quarter results in more detail before we take your questions.\nLet me start with some first quarter highlights. Our results in the quarter were strong and reflected the continued progress we're making to improve returns. We grew revenue from both the fourth quarter and a year ago. We continue to make progress on our efficiency initiatives and expenses declined from both the fourth quarter and the year ago, driven by lower operating losses, but we continue to be focused on controlling other expenses as well.\nThe consumer and majority of our businesses remain strong. Delinquencies and net charge-offs have continued to slowly increase as expected. We're looking for signs of accelerated deterioration in asset classes or segments of our customers. And broadly speaking, we saw a little change in the trends from the prior quarter.\nHowever, weakness continues to develop in commercial real estate office, and Mike will discuss this in more detail. Given what we're seeing, we're taking incremental actions to tighten credit on higher risk segments, but continue to lend broadly. We increased our allowance for credit losses for the fourth consecutive quarter. Our economic expectations used to support the allowance have not changed meaningfully, but we do continue to look at specific asset classes, such as commercial real estate to appropriately assess the adequacy of the allowance. We will continue to monitor the trends in each of our loan portfolios to determine the future action is warranted.\nBoth commercial and consumer average loans were up from a year ago, but were relatively stable from the fourth quarter. Consumer spending remained strong with growth in both debit and credit card spend, but spending began to soften late in the quarter. The decline in average deposits that started a year ago continued in the first quarter, primarily driven by customers seeking higher-yielding alternatives and continued growth in consumer spending. We did see some moderate inflows from the few specific banks that have been highlighted in the press, but those inflows have abated. Our CET1 ratio, which was already strong, increased to 10.8% even as we resumed common stock repurchases in the first quarter buying back $4 billion in common stock.\nLet me share some thoughts on the recent market events impacting the banking industry. We're glad that the work we have completed over the last several years has put us in a position to help support the U.S. financial system. Along with 10 other large banks, we utilized our strength and liquidity, and we made a $5 billion uninsured deposit into First Republic Bank, reflecting our confidence in the country's banking system and to help provide First Republic with liquidity to continue serving its customers.\nI'm proud of everything our employees have done during this historic period to be there for our customers. We believe banks of all sizes are an important part of our financial system as each is uniquely positioned to serve their customers and communities. It's important to recognize that banks have different operating models and that the banks that failed in the first quarter were quite different from what people think of when they think about the typical regional bank. These particular banks had concentrated business models with heavy reliance on uninsured deposits.\nOur franchise and those of many other banks operate with a broader business model and more diversified funding sources. It is times like these that the many benefits of our own franchise become even more clear. Our diversified business model provides opportunities to serve our customers broadly, which reduces concentration risk across the different elements of risk.\nMost importantly, our customers benefit from our size and the range of banking services we provide, which helps us build a full relationship with individuals and companies. We also have strong capital and liquidity positions, which include a mix of deposits and access to multiple funding sources and our continued focus on financial and credit risk management allows us to support our customers throughout economic cycles.\nNow let me update you on the progress we've made on our strategic priorities. Our top priority remains building out our risk and control framework appropriate for our company. I spent time in my recent annual letter, highlighting why we remain confident in our ability to complete this work, including having much more effective reporting and processes in place to provide appropriate oversight, adding close to 10,000 people across numerous risk and control-related groups as part of our commitment to make the investments needed to complete door and building the management discipline and culture to govern and execute the work, which includes the operating committee reviewing risk and regulatory progress and escalations on a weekly basis.\nI also summarize the actions we've taken to simplify the way we operate. This work continued in the first quarter as we largely completed the exit of the correspondent home lending business as part of our plans to simplify that business. We're also narrowing our retail mortgage business to focus on predominantly bank customers and underserved communities.\nOur strategy includes broadening our existing investment from the special purpose credit program to include purchase loans, investing an additional $100 million to advance racial equity in homeownership and deploying additional home mortgage consultants in local minority communities. We continue to transform the way we serve our customers by offering innovative products and solutions.\nWe announced a multiyear agreement with Choice Hotels to launch a new co-branded credit card this month, creating a best-in-class credit card program designed to enhance our customers' experience and bring them more value. We rolled out early payday late last year, which makes eligible direct deposits available up to 2 days early.\nIn the first quarter, this enhancement provided customers early access to over $200 billion in direct deposits. We launched Flex Loan in the fourth quarter, a digital-only small dollar loan that provides eligible customers, convenient and affordable access to funds. Customer response continues to exceed our expectations, we've originated over 100,000 loans since November.\nDigital adoption and usage among our consumer customers continued to increase. We added over 500,000 mobile active customers in the first quarter and digital logins increased 6% from a year ago. Since rolling out Vantage, our new enhanced digital experience for our commercial and corporate clients late last year, we've received overwhelmingly positive feedback on the new user experience. Vantage uses AI and machine learning to provide a tailored and intuitive platform based on our clients' specific needs.\nWe also continued to make progress on our environmental, social and governance work. We announced a $50 million grant to the NAACP to support efforts to advance racial equity in America. This is the single largest donation at the NAACP has ever received from the corporation and builds on our long-standing relationship with the NAACP that spans more than 20 years. The Wells Fargo Foundation expanded its commitment to housing affordability through another $20 million housing affordability breakthrough challenge to advance ideas to help meet the need for more affordable homes across the country. We also announced a $20 million commitment to advance economic opportunities in Native American communities including addressing housing, small business, financial health and sustainability.\nBefore concluding, I wanted to highlight the management changes we announced yesterday. Mary Mack, the CEO of consumer and small business banking is retiring this summer. She spent her entire career at Wells Fargo and has led consumer and small business banking for the past 7 years through a significant amount of change, including defining a new path forward to the business. I can think of few Wells Fargo colleagues, who have done as much for our company and have been as visible in the communities that we serve over such a long period of time.\nWe also announced that Saul Van Beurden, Head of Technology at Wells Fargo will succeed Mary. Sal is a strong leader, a technologist and he knows how to run a business. This makes him the ideal person to lead consumer and small business banking into the future. Our branch network will continue to be the key to the business. But our customers expect us to provide them with increasingly digitized and seamless banking experiences across all channels. Saul understands this deeply and has consistently proven his ability to convert new products and services across Wells Fargo.\nFinally, Tracy Kerrins, currently Head of Consumer Technology will become head of technology for the company reporting to me. Tracy has worked with the technology and finance industry for more than 20 years and has led a series of business critical initiatives to modernize our technology platforms across our consumer businesses. She is a strong results-driven leader.\nIt's always great when we can tap our own leaders for roles within the company, and I want to thank Mary for everything she's done during her tenure at Wells Fargo. It's truly been a pleasure working with her.\nAs we look forward, we're carefully watching customer behavior for clues on how the economic environment is changing. Customer activity is still relatively strong and delinquencies remain low, though they are increasing. There are pockets of risks such as commercial office real estate, which will likely impact institutions differently, and we're proactively managing our own exposures.\nWe continue to expect economic growth to slow, and we are preparing for a range of scenarios. We will continue to monitor both the markets and our customers and will react accordingly. Our diversified business model should enable us to support our customers throughout economic cycles.\nI will now turn the call over to Mike.\n\nMichael P. Santomassimo\n\nSenior EVP & CFO, The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation\n\nThank you, Charlie, and good morning, everyone. Net income for the first quarter was $5 billion or $1.23 per diluted common share. While there was a lot going on in the banking industry around us, we continue to focus on our priorities and our results reflected the progress we are making, which I'll highlight throughout the call.\nStarting with capital and liquidity on Slide 3. Our CET1 ratio was 10.8%, up approximately 20 basis points from the fourth quarter, reflecting our earnings in the quarter and lower risk-weighted assets. After pausing share repurchases for the prior 3 quarters, we repurchased $4 billion of common stock in the first quarter. Our CET1 ratio remained well above our required regulatory minimum plus buffers, and we expect to continue to prudently return excess capital to shareholders in the coming quarters.\nIn the first quarter, our liquidity coverage ratio was approximately 22 percentage points above the regulatory minimum. We continue to benefit from a diversified deposit base with over 60% of our deposits in our Consumer Banking and Lending segment as of the first quarter, which is a higher percentage than before the pandemic.\nTurning to credit quality on Slide 5. Net loan charge-offs continue to slowly increase to 26 basis points in the first quarter, but were still below pre-pandemic levels. Commercial net loan charge-offs decreased $16 million from the fourth quarter to 5 basis points. However, while losses improved, we continue to see some gradual weakening in underlying credit performance, including higher nonperforming assets.\nWe are proactively monitoring our clients' sensitivity to inflation and higher rates and are taking appropriate actions when warranted. We are also closely monitoring our commercial real estate office portfolio, and I'll share some more details on our exposure on the next slide. As expected, we've seen consumer delinquencies and losses gradually increase.\nTotal consumer net loan charge-offs increased $60 million from the fourth quarter to 56 basis points of average loans, driven by an increase in the credit card portfolio. While most consumers remain resilient, we've seen some consumer financial health trends gradually weakening from a year ago, and we've continued to take credit taking actions to position the portfolio for a slowing economy.\nNonperforming assets increased 7% from the fourth quarter, driven by higher commercial real estate nonaccrual loans that were down 12% from a year ago due to lower residential mortgage nonaccrual loans. Of note, 87% of the nonaccrual loans in our commercial real estate portfolio were current on interest and 75% recurring on both principal and interest as of the end of the first quarter. Our allowance for credit losses increased to $643 million in the first quarter, reflecting an increase for commercial real estate loans, primarily office loans as well as an increase for credit card and auto loans.\nGiven the increased focus on commercial real estate loans, especially office, we provided more details on our portfolio on Slide 6. We have $154.7 billion of commercial real estate loans outstanding at the end of the first quarter with $35.7 billion of office loans, which represented 4% of our total loans outstanding. The office market continues to show signs of weakness due to lower demand, higher financing costs and challenging capital market conditions. While we haven't seen this translate to meaningful loss content yet, we expect to see more stress over time.\nAs you would expect, we have been derisking the office portfolio, which resulted in commitments declining 5% from a year ago, and we continue to proactively work with borrowers to manage our exposure, including structural enhancements and paydowns as warranted.\nAs you can see in the slide, we've provided some additional data on the office portfolio, including approximately 12% is owner occupied. Therefore, the loan performance is mostly tied to the cash flow of the owner's operating business rather than rents paid by tenants. Nearly 1/3 had recourse to a guarantor typically through a repayment guarantee. The portfolio is geographically diverse, and as you'd expect, the largest concentrations are in California and New York.\nOver 2/3 of our office loans are in the Corporate and Investment Banking business, and the vast majority of this portfolio is institutional quality real estate with high-caliber sponsors. While approximately 80% of it is Class A, keep in mind that this is a single measure that is hard to evaluate in isolation. For example, newer or refurbished properties may perform better regardless of whether they are Class A or B.\nWe are providing this data to give you more insight into the portfolio, but as is usually the case in commercial real estate, each property situation is different and a myriad of other variables, such as leasing rates, loan-to-value and debt yields can determine performance, which is why we regularly review the portfolio on a loan-by-loan basis.\nAs a result of market conditions and the recent increases in criticized assets and nonaccrual loans, we've increased our allowance for credit losses for office loans for the past 4 quarters. The allowance for credit losses coverage ratio at the end of the first quarter for the office portfolio in the Corporate Investment Bank was 5.7%. We will continue to closely monitor this portfolio, but as has been the case in prior cycles, this will likely play out over an extended period of time as we actively work with borrowers to help it solve issues they may be facing.\nOn Slide 7, we highlight loans and deposits. Average loans grew 6% from a year ago and were relatively stable from the fourth quarter, while period-end loans declined 1% from the fourth quarter with lower balances across our consumer and commercial portfolios.\nI'll highlight specific drivers when discussing our operating segment results. Average loan yields increased 244 basis points from a year ago and 56 basis points from the fourth quarter, reflecting the higher interest rate environment. Average deposits declined 7% from a year ago and 2% for the fourth quarter due to the consumer deposit outflows as customers continue to reallocate cash into higher-yielding alternatives and continued spending.\nDuring the market stress last month, we experienced a brief increase in deposit inflows that has since abated and while our period-end deposit balances were slightly higher than we expected at the beginning of the quarter, they're still down 2% from the fourth quarter. As expected, our average deposit cost increased 37 basis points from the fourth quarter to 83 basis points with higher deposit costs across all operating segments in response to rising interest rates. Our mix of noninterest-bearing deposits declined from 35% in the fourth quarter to 32% in the first quarter, but remained above pre-pandemic levels.\nTurning to net interest income on Slide 8. First quarter net interest income was $13.3 billion, which was 45% higher than a year ago as we continue to benefit from the impact of higher rates. The $97 million decline for the fourth quarter was due to 2 fewer business days.\nOur full year net interest income guidance has not changed from last quarter as we still expect 2023 net interest income to grow by approximately 10% compared with 2022. And Ultimately, the amount of net interest income we earned this year will depend on a variety of factors, many of which are uncertain, including the absolute level of interest rates, the shape of the yield curve, deposit balances, mix and repricing and loan demand.\nTurning to expenses on Slide 9. Noninterest expense declined 1% from a year ago, driven by lower operating losses and the impact of business initiatives. The increase in personnel expense from the fourth quarter was driven by approximately $650 million seasonally higher expenses in the first quarter, including payroll taxes, restricted stock expense for retirement eligible employees and 401(k) matching contributions.\nOur full year 2023 noninterest expense, excluding operating losses, is still expected to be approximately $50.2 billion, unchanged from the guidance we provided last quarter. As a reminder, we have outstanding litigation, regulatory and customer remediation matters that could impact operating losses.\nTurning to our operating segments, starting with Consumer Banking and Lending on Slide 10. Consumer and small business banking revenue increased 28% from a year ago as higher net interest income driven by the impact of higher interest rates was partially offset by lower deposit-related fees driven by the overdraft policy changes we rolled out last year.\nWe are continuing to make investments in this business. We're beginning to increase marketing spend. We're accelerating the efforts to renovate and refurbish our branches, for our bankers, we're investing in new tools and capabilities to provide better and more personalized advice to customers. We're continuing to enhance our mobile app and mobile active users were up 4% year-over-year and we're also seeing increased activity and positive initial indicators after our rollout of Wells Fargo Premier last year.\nIt's early on for all of these initiatives, but we're starting to see some green shoots. At the same time, we continue to execute on our efficiency initiatives. Teller transactions continue to decline with reduced head count. We reduced headcount by 9% and total branches were down 4% from a year ago.\nIn home lending, mortgage rates remained elevated and the mortgage market continued to decline. Our home lending revenue declined 42% from a year ago, driven by lower mortgage originations, including a significant decline from the correspondent channel and lower revenue from the resecuritization of loans purchased from securitization pools. We continue to reduce headcount in the first quarter, and we expect staffing levels will continue to decline due to the strategic changes we announced earlier this year. We stopped accepting applications from the correspondent channel as announced in January and begin to reduce the complexity and the size of the servicing book.\nDuring the first quarter, we successfully marketed mortgage servicing rights for approximately $50 billion of loans serviced for others that we expect to close later this year. We will continue to look for additional opportunities to simplify and reduce the size of our servicing business. Credit card revenue increased 3% from a year ago due to higher loan balances driven by higher point-of-sale volume.\nAuto revenue declined 12% from a year ago, driven by lower loan balances and continued loan spread compression from credit tightening actions and continued price competition due to rising interest rates. Personal lending revenue was up 9% from a year ago due to higher loan balances.\nTurning to some key business drivers on Slide 11. Mortgage originations declined 83% from a year ago and 55% from the fourth quarter with declines in both correspondent and retail originations. As I mentioned, we stopped accepting correspondent applications in January. So going forward, our originations will be focused on serving Wells Fargo customers and underserved communities.\nThe size of our auto portfolio has declined for 4 consecutive quarters and the balances were down 80% at the end of the first quarter compared to a year ago. Origination volume declined 32% from a year ago, reflecting credit tightening actions and continued price competition. Debit card spending increased 2% in the first quarter, compared to a year ago, an increase from the 1% year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter. Discretionary spending drove the growth with nondiscretionary spending stable from the fourth quarter levels.\nCredit card spending increased 16% from a year ago, in line with the year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter with sustained growth in both discretionary and nondiscretionary spending. Spending growth slowed throughout the quarter, but was still at double-digit levels in March. We continue to see some slight moderation in payment rates in the first quarter, but they were still well above pre-pandemic levels.\nTurning to Commercial Banking results on Slide 12. Middle Market Banking revenue grew by 73% from a year ago due to the impact of higher interest rates and higher loan balances while deposit-related fees were lower, reflecting higher earnings credit rate on noninterest-bearing deposits. Asset-Based Lending and Leasing revenue increased 7% year-over-year, driven by loan growth which was partially offset by lower net gains from equity securities.\nAverage loan balances were up 15% in the first quarter compared to a year ago, driven by new customer growth and higher line utilization. After being stable in second half of last year, volume utilization increased slightly in the first quarter. Average loan balances have grown for 7 consecutive quarters and were up 2% from the fourth quarter with the growth in Asset-Based Lending and Leasing driven by continued growth in client inventory. Growth in Middle Market Banking was once again driven by larger clients, including both new and existing relationships, which more than offset declines from our smaller clients.\nTurning to Corporate and Investment Banking on Slide 13. Banking revenue increased 37% from a year ago, driven by stronger treasury management results, reflecting the impact of higher interest rates. Investment management -- investment banking fees declined from a year ago, reflecting lower market activity with declines across all major products in nearly all industries. While commercial real estate market transactions are down across the industry, our commercial real estate revenue grew 32% from a year ago, driven by the impact of higher interest rates and higher loan balances.\nMarkets revenue increased 53% from a year ago driven by higher trading results across all asset classes. Average loans grew 4% from a year ago, but were down from the fourth quarter. Lower balances in banking reflected a combination of slow demand, increased payoffs and relatively stable line utilization. The decline in commercial real estate balances were driven by the higher rate environment and lower commercial real estate sales volumes.\nOn Slide 14, Wealth and Investment Management revenue was down 2% compared to a year ago, driven by lower asset-based fees due to lower market valuations. Growth in net interest income was driven by the impact of higher rates, which was partially offset by lower deposit balances as customers continued to reallocate cash into higher-yielding alternatives.\nAt the end of the first quarter, cash alternatives were approximately 12% of total client assets, up from approximately 4% a year ago. Expenses decreased 4% from a year ago, driven by lower revenue-related compensation and the impact of efficiency initiatives. Average loans were down 1% from a year ago, primarily due to a decline in securities-based lending.\nSlide 15 highlights our corporate results. Revenue declined $103 million or 83% from a year ago as higher net interest income was more than offset by lower results in our affiliated venture capital and private equity businesses. Results in the first quarter included $342 million of net losses on equity securities or $223 million pretax and net of noncontrolling interests.\nIn summary, our results in the first quarter reflected an improvement in our earnings capacity. We grew revenue and reduced expenses and had strong growth in pretax free provision profits. As expected, our net charge-offs have continued to slightly increase from historical lows, and we are closely monitoring our portfolios and taking credit tightening actions where appropriate.\nOur capital levels grew even as we resume stock common stock repurchases, and we expect repurchases to continue. In the guidance we provided last quarter for full year 2023, net interest income and expenses, excluding operating losses, has not changed.\nWe will now take your questions."

[Operator Instructions] Please note that today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to John Campbell, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin the conference.\n\nJohn M. Campbell\n\nDirector-Investor Relations, Wells Fargo & Co.\n\nGood morning. Thank you for joining our call today where our CEO, Charlie Scharf; and our CFO, Mike Santomassimo, will discuss fourth quarter results and answer your questions. This call is being recorded. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our fourth quarter earnings materials, including the release, financial supplement and presentation deck are available on our website at wellsfargo.com. I'd also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings, including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings materials. Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures can also be found in our SEC filings and the earnings materials available on our website.\nI will now turn the call over to Charlie.\n\nCharles W. Scharf\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Visa, Inc.\n\nThanks, John. I'll make some brief comments about our results and update you on our priorities. I'll then turn the call over to Mike to review fourth quarter results as well as our net interest income and expense expectations for 2024 before we take your questions. Let me start with some 2023 financial highlights. Although our improved 2023 results benefited from the strong economic environment and higher interest rates, our continued focus on efficiency and strong credit discipline were important contributors as well. We grew net income and diluted earnings per share with higher revenue and lower expenses.\nRevenue growth was driven by strong growth in net interest income as well as higher noninterest income. Our expenses were down from a year ago, benefiting from lower operating losses as well as the impact of efficiency initiatives. As expected, net charge-offs increased from historical low levels and our allowance for credit losses increased as well. We continue to closely monitor our portfolios, taking credit tightening actions as appropriate. We returned a significant amount of capital to our shareholders, including increasing our common stock dividend from $0.30 per share to $0.35 per share in the third quarter, and we repurchased $12 billion of common stock.\nAverage loans increased modestly with growth in the first half of the year, offsetting declines later in the year, reflecting weaker loan demand as well as credit tightening actions. Average deposits were down driven by consumer spending as well as customers migrating to higher-yielding alternatives. The financial health of our consumers remain strong. While average deposit balances per customer continue to decline from their peak, they remained above prepandemic levels as wage growth has more than offset increased spending. Having said that, there are cohorts of customers that are more stressed.\nConsumer spending remained strong. Credit card spend was up 15% for the year and was remarkably stable throughout the year, with growth rates strong across all categories, except fuel, which was impacted by lower gas prices. Debit card spending was up 1% for the year. Discretionary spend growth slowed from year ago while nondiscretionary spend was stable. Our risk and control work remains our top priority, and I refer you to the comments I made last quarter regarding both our progress in completing the work as well as the risks that remain.\nWe continue to execute on our strategic priorities. And while it is early, and we have more to do, we are starting to see improved growth and increase market share in parts of the company which we believe will drive higher returns over time. Let me provide just a few examples. Our new credit card products have driven an increase in consumer spend at a rate significantly better than the industry average. We've also been investing in the Corporate Investment Bank. CIB revenue grew 26% from a year ago, and our investment banking and trading market shares increased. The positive results in both areas were accomplished while maintaining our existing risk appetite.\nAdditionally, continued execution of our more focused home lending strategy should also produce higher returns and earnings over the next several years. And while our consumer, small and business banking, commercial banking and wealth and investment management business remains strong, opportunities to increase share are significant. Other accomplishments include we launched a new co-branded credit cards with Choice Hotels, building on the new products we've launched over the last couple of years.\nWe continued to enhance our mobile app, which is driving mobile adoption momentum, adding 1.6 million mobile active customers in 2023 and increasing mobile logins 11% from a year ago. Consumers interacted over 20 million times last year with Fargo, our AI-powered virtual assistant. We exceeded our $150 million commitment to help advance racial equity in home ownership. Our special purpose credit program lowered mortgage rates and reduced financing costs to help thousands of customers.\nFor commercial clients, we continued to invest in order to have the right people and the right capabilities to better penetrate our customer base. We continue to attract experienced bankers to our investment bank helping us drive growth in priority products and sectors. Throughout 2023, we added new heads and co-heads of equity capital markets, global mergers and acquisitions, financial institutions, financial sponsors, health care and technology, media and telecom. We've also started to see the benefit of the targeted investments we are making in our trading capabilities, including adding talent and improved technology with a focus on supporting our core clients.\nFinally, we're launching a partnership with Centerbridge, which helps us provide our middle market clients with access to alternative sources of capital, another example of how we're providing solutions for our clients. Investing in our business and introducing new products and services remains a priority in 2024, and Mike will highlight some of the opportunities later on the call. In 2023, we also continued to take a closer look at the businesses that were not in sync with our strategic priorities. As I mentioned, we simplified the home lending business, which included exiting the correspondent business. We are reducing the size of our servicing portfolio as well as optimizing our retail team to align with our narrower customer focus.\nIn the third quarter, we sold private equity investments in certain Norwest Equity Partners and Norwest Mezzanine Partners funds. We also continue to invest in the communities we serve throughout the year, and you can see many examples at the beginning of our slide presentation. As we look forward, our business performance remains sensitive to interest rates and the health of the U.S. economy but we are confident that the actions we are taking will drive stronger results over the cycle.\nWe are closely monitoring credit and while we've seen modest deterioration, it remains consistent with our expectations. Our capital position remains strong and returning excess capital to shareholders remains a priority. Mike will talk more about our expectations for 2024, but I'd like to make a couple of points. First, we have seen and have said that we expect net interest income to decline from the high levels we saw as rates were rising last year. And given that we remain modestly asset sensitive, the implied Fed rate path reflected in recent forward curves impacts our outlook for NII.\nSignificant uncertainty exists regarding eventual timing and extent of Federal Reserve interest rate actions. Mike will give you our expectations for net interest income, but please recognize that it is based upon a series of market assumptions, which may be right or may be wrong. We hope the overview of our assumptions is helpful. Second, we remain focused on tightly controlling our expenses, but there are several moving pieces, which Mike will walk you through.\nWe will continue to invest what's necessary for our risk and control work. We continue to realize expense efficiencies. And at this point, we are planning to increase our investment spending to create better growth and higher returns in future. Our expected efficiencies roughly offset our planned increase in additional spend at this point. Decisions on how much to invest are dynamic. We closely monitor the outcomes of our investments, and we will adjust our plans based on the success we see. We are focused on our shorter-term results but remain committed to building a well-managed, faster-growing and higher return company over the medium and longer term.\nI have said and I remain excited about the opportunities to increase our share and returns across all of our businesses. We believe the actions we have taken and continue to take, provide the path to 50% ROTCE. I want to conclude by thanking our employees for their dedication, talent and all they do to move our company forward. I'm excited about Wells Fargo's future and all that we will accomplish in the year ahead. Mike, over to you.\n\nMichael P. Santomassimo\n\nSenior EVP & CFO, The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation\n\nThank you, Charlie, and good morning, everyone. The first couple of slides summarize how we helped our customers and communities last year, some of which Charlie highlighted, so I'm going to start with our fourth quarter financial results on Slide 4.\nNet income for the fourth quarter was $3.4 billion, or $0.86 per diluted common share. Our fourth quarter results included $1.9 billion or $0.40 per share for the FDIC special assessment, and $1.1 billion of severance expense, including $969 million or $0.20 per share for planned actions. These expenses were partially offset by $621 million or $0.17 per share of discrete tax benefits related to the resolution of prior period tax matters.\nTurning to capital and liquidity on Slide 5. Our CET1 ratio increased to 11.4% in the fourth quarter, 2.5 percentage points above our regulatory minimum plus buffers. This increase was driven by our earnings and an increase in accumulated other comprehensive income, reflecting lower interest rates and tighter mortgage-backed security spreads. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased $2.4 billion in common stock. We repurchased a total of $12 billion in common stock in 2023, and we currently expect to be able to repurchase more than this amount in 2024. We will continue to consider current market conditions, including interest rate movements, risk-weighted asset levels, stress test results as well as any potential economic uncertainty with respect to the amount and timing of share repurchases over the coming quarters.\nTurning to credit quality on Slide 7.\nAs expected, net loan charge-offs increased up 17 basis points from the third quarter to 53 basis points of average loans, driven by commercial real estate office and credit card loans. The increase in commercial net loan charge-offs reflected the higher losses in commercial real estate office, while losses in the rest of our commercial portfolio were stable in the third quarter. As expected, losses started to materialize in our commercial real estate office portfolio as market fundamentals remain weak. The losses were across a number of loans spread across various markets and were driven by borrower performance, lower appraisals were the result of properties or loans being sold at a loss. .\nWe substantially built reserves for this portfolio throughout 2023 as criticized and nonperforming assets increased. And while we expect additional losses in the coming quarters given the market fundamentals, and capital markets and liquidity challenges in this sector, the amounts will likely be uneven and episodic. Our commercial real estate team has a rigorous monitoring process and continues to derisk and reduce exposure, and we're using this information to evaluate our allowance, which I will discuss later.\nConsumer net loan charge-offs continued to increase and were up $118 million from the third quarter to 79 basis points of average loans. The increase was driven by the credit card portfolio, which performed as expected with increased losses driven by recent vintages maturing. Nonperforming assets increased 3% from the third quarter as growth in commercial nonaccrual loans more than offset declines in consumer. The increase in commercial real estate nonaccrual loans was driven by a $567 million increase in office nonaccrual loans.\nMoving to Slide 8. Our allowance for credit losses increased slightly in the fourth quarter driven by an increase for credit card and commercial real estate loans, partially offset by a lower allowance for auto loans. The table on the page shows the allowance for credit losses coverage ratio for commercial real estate, including the breakdown of the office portfolio. While the charge-offs we took in the fourth quarter were contemplated in our allowance, we are still early in the cycle. And after going through our quarterly review process, the coverage ratio in our CIB commercial real estate office portfolio remains relatively stable at 11%.\nOn Slide 9, we highlight loans and deposits. Average loans were down from both the third quarter and a year ago. Credit card loans continue to grow, while most other categories declined. I'll highlight specific drivers when discussing our operating segment results. Average loan yields increased 122 basis points from a year ago and 12 basis points from the third quarter, reflecting the higher interest rate environment. Average deposits declined 3% from a year ago as growth in corporate and investment banking was more than offset by declines in other -- in our other deposit gathering businesses, reflecting continued consumer spending and customers reallocating cash into higher-yielding alternatives.\nPeriod-end deposits included in the chart on the bottom of the page, were up $4.2 billion from the third quarter as declines in consumer banking and lending were offset by slightly higher deposits in Wealth and Investment Management for the first time in over a year, as well as higher commercial deposits, which included our efforts to attract clients' operational deposits. As expected, our average deposit costs continued to increase, up 22 basis points from the third quarter to 158 basis points with higher deposit costs across all operating segments.\nThe pace of the increase was similar to the third quarter. Our mix of deposits continue to shift with our percentage of noninterest-bearing deposits declining to 27%. Turning to net interest income on Slide 10. Fourth quarter net interest income declined $662 million or 5% from a year ago due to lower deposit loan balances, partially offset by the impact of higher interest rates. I'll provide details on our 2024 net interest income expectations later on the call.\nTurning to expenses on Slide 11. Our fourth quarter noninterest expense included the FDIC special assessment and $1.1 billion of severance expense, including $969 million for planned actions, expenses declined from a year ago driven by lower operating losses. While most of the planned actions should result in lower headcount, some of the actions are related to our workforce location strategy, which should lower occupancy costs and provide other benefits but may not always reduce headcount.\nTotal expenses increased from the third quarter driven by the FDIC special assessment and higher severance expense. Personnel expense increased $554 million from the third quarter as higher severance expense was partially offset by lower benefits and incentive compensation expense, including certain year-end adjustments as well as the impact of efficiency initiatives, including lower headcount.\nTurning to our operating segments, starting with Consumer Banking and Lending on Slide 12. Consumer, Small and Business Banking revenue increased 1% from a year ago, driven by higher net interest income, reflecting higher interest rates, partially offset by lower deposit balances. We've been focusing on controlling expenses and lowering the cost to serve our customers, which includes driving digital adoption, simplifying our product portfolio and using technology to automate our operating environment.\nAs our customers continue to shift to lower cost channels, resulting in fewer teller transactions and handled call volumes, we've reduced our total number of branches by over 280 or 6% from a year ago. At the same time, we have been refurbishing our branches as part of an accelerated multiyear effort to transform and refresh our full branch network. I'll highlight other ways we are investing to improve the customer experience later on the call. Home lending revenue increased 7% from a year ago. Lower gain on sale margins and originations as well as lower loan balances were more than offset by improved valuations on loans held for sale due to losses in the fourth quarter of 2022.\nWe continue to reduce headcount in home lending in the fourth quarter, down 36% from a year ago reflecting market conditions as well as our new strategy. Credit card revenue declined 1% from a year ago, driven by the impact of introductory promotional rates and higher rewards expense, partially offset by higher loan balances and interchange revenue. Payment rates have been relatively stable over the past year and remained above pre-pandemic levels. New account growth continues to be strong, up 17% from a year ago.\nAuto revenue declined 19% from a year ago, driven by lower loan balances and continued loan spread compression and personal lending revenue was up 13% from a year ago due to higher loan balances.\nTurning to some key business drivers on Slide 13. Mortgage originations declined 69% from a year ago and 30% from the third quarter reflecting the progress we made on our strategic objectives for this business as well as the decline in the mortgage market. As we executed on our strategic objectives, we've also made significant progress on reducing the amount of third-party loans serviced down 18% from a year ago. The size of our auto portfolio has declined for 7 consecutive quarters and balances were down 11% at the end of the fourth quarter compared to a year ago.\nOrigination volume declined 34% year-over-year, reflecting credit-tightening actions. Debit card spend increased 2% from a year ago with both discretionary and nondiscretionary spend up 2% with growth in most categories, except for home improvement, fuel and travel. Credit card spending continued to be strong. It was up 15% from a year ago. All categories grew with double-digit growth rates in every category, except fuel, home improvement [indiscernible] apparel.\nTurning to Commercial Banking results on Slide 14. Middle Market Banking revenue increased 6% from a year ago, driven by the impact of higher interest rates and higher deposit-related fees, reflecting lower earnings credit rates. Asset-based lending and leasing revenue increased 9% year-over-year due to the impact of higher interest rates and improved results on equity investments. Average loan balances were up 2% from a year ago, driven by growth in asset-based lending and leasing.\nTurning to Corporate and Investment Banking on Slide 15. Banking revenue increased 15% from a year ago, driven by higher lending revenue, higher investment banking revenue due to increased activity across all products and stronger treasury management results. As Charlie highlighted, we've successfully hired experienced bankers, which is helping us deliver for our clients and positioning us well for when markets improve. Commercial real estate revenue grew 2% from a year ago, reflecting the impact of higher interest rates partially offset by lower loan and deposit balances.\nMarkets revenue increased 33% from a year ago, driven by higher revenue in structured products, equities, credit products and commodities. Average loans were down 3% from a year ago, with growth in markets more than offset by declines in banking and commercial real estate. On Slide 16, Wealth and Investment Management revenue declined 1% compared to a year ago, reflecting lower net interest income, driven by lower deposit balances as customers continue to reallocate cash into higher-yielding alternatives. The decline in net interest income from a year ago was partially offset by higher asset-based fees due to increased market valuations.\nAs a reminder, the majority of WIM advisory assets are priced at the beginning of the quarter, so fourth quarter results reflected market valuations as of October 1, which were higher from a year ago. Asset-based fees in the first quarter will reflect valuations as of January 1, which were also higher from a year ago. Average loans were down 3% from a year ago, driven by a decline in securities-based lending. Slide 17 highlights our corporate results. Revenue declined $345 million from a year ago, reflecting higher deposit crediting rates paid to the operating segments. This decline was partially offset by improved results in our affiliated venture capital business on lower impairments.\nTurning to our expectations for 2024, starting on Slide 18. Let me start by highlighting our expectations for net interest income. As we look forward, there are a number of factors that could impact our results, including the ultimate path of rates, the shape of the yield curve, quantitative tightening in fiscal deficits, consumer behavior and competitive behavior to name just a few, all of which we have little to no control over. This makes it particularly difficult to estimate an interest income for 2024. There is more uncertainty than usual given the market's strong view of rate cut timing in the quantum.\nLooking at our results. While we had strong growth in full year net interest income in 2023 versus 2022, our net interest income came down modestly each quarter last year, driven by the higher deposit pricing and mix changes. You can see this impact when you annualize our fourth quarter net interest income, which was down approximately 3% from our full year 2023 net interest income of $52.4 billion. Our current expectation is that full year 2024 net interest income could potentially be approximately 7% to 9% lower than our full year 2023. This expectation is anchored on the forward rate curve and a series of business assumptions, including lower rates in the recent forward rate curve, which given our modestly asset-sensitive position would be a headwind to net interest income.\nA slight decline in average loans for the full year, which includes modest growth in commercial and credit card loans in the second half of the year after a slow start to the year. Reinvestment of lower-yielding securities runoff into higher-yielding assets, which would also modestly extend the duration of the investment portfolio, further attrition in consumer banking and lending deposits as well as continued mix shift from lower yielding products to higher yielding. Deposits in our other deposit gathering businesses are expected to be relatively stable and market funding [indiscernible] consumer deposits as needed.\nWe currently expect that net interest income will trough towards the end of this year. As we've done in prior years, we are also assuming the asset capital remain in place throughout the year. Ultimately, the amount of net interest income we earned in 2024 will depend on a variety of factors, which -- many of which are uncertain, including the absolute level of rates, the shape of the yield curve, deposit balances, mix and pricing and loan demand.\nTurning to our 2024 expense expectations on Slide 19. We started our focus on efficiency initiatives 3 years ago, and we've successfully delivered on our commitment of approximately $10 billion of gross expense saves. Through our efficiency initiatives, we have reduced head count every quarter since third quarter of 2020 and head count is down 16% since the end of 2020. Looking at our expectations for this year and following the waterfall on the slide from left to right, we reported $55.6 billion of noninterest expense in 2023, which included the $1.9 billion FDIC special assessment.\nExcluding this item, expenses would have been $53.6 billion which we believe is a good starting point for discussion of 2024 expenses. Looking at the next bar, we expect severance expense to be approximately $1.3 billion lower driven by the $969 million expense we took in the fourth quarter for planned actions. We expect expenses to increase by at least $300 million due to higher revenue-related expense driven by Wealth and Investment Management. Revenue-related expenses will ultimately be a function of activity in market levels and therefore, could be higher or lower than this estimate.\nAt this point, we expect all other expenses to be flat, though there are significant efficiencies and increased investments included in this expectation. We expect approximately $2.7 billion of gross expense reductions in 2024 due to the efficiency initiatives. We highlighted in the slides some of the areas where we anticipate additional savings and continue to believe we have more opportunities beyond 2024. Similar to prior years, the resources needed to address our risk and control work are separate from our efficiency initiatives and we will continue to make significant investments in our risk and control infrastructure.\nWhile we remain focused on executing on our efficiency initiatives, we're also continuing to invest, and we expect approximately $1.1 billion of incremental technology and equipment expense, reflecting higher costs related to the amortization of investment in prior years as well as new investments planned for 2024. We also expect merit increases of approximately $700 million, which are primarily awarded to employees with lower salaries. We highlight some of the other areas where we plan to invest on the next slide.\nOur 2024 expense outlook includes ongoing business-related operating losses of approximately $1.3 billion, similar to the level we had in 2023. As previously disclosed, we have outstanding litigation, regulatory and customer remediation matters that could impact operating losses. So putting this all together, we expect 2024 noninterest expense to be approximately $52.6 billion. It's important to note that while we've made substantial progress executing on our efficiency initiatives, as Charlie highlighted, we still have a significant opportunity to get more efficient across the company.\nGiven how critical it is to continue to invest in our business, on Slide 20, we provide some examples of our areas of focus for 2024. Let me highlight a few. Building the right risk and control infrastructure remains our top priority, and we will continue to invest in this important work. Charlie discussed many of the technology investments we've already made to transform how we serve both our consumer and commercial customers, and we plan to continue to invest in these areas this year throughout our businesses. We are planning to hire more bankers and advisers to grow our Wells Fargo Premier offering to our affluent clients. We plan to launch a new travel-oriented credit card as part of our Autograph suite of products as well as the new small business credit card this year. To better serve our commercial clients, we plan to continue to hire within investment banking and commercial banking to support priority sectors and products to help drive growth.\nNow let me conclude with Slide 21, where we will discuss return on tangible common equity. When we first discussed our path to improving returns on the fourth quarter 2020 earnings call, we had an 8% ROTCE. Since then, we have taken multiple actions to improve our returns, including executing on our efficiency initiatives, investing in our businesses to help drive growth and returning excess capital to shareholders, including increasing our common stock dividend from $0.10 to $0.35 per share and repurchasing $32 billion of common stock. These actions helped to improve our ROTCE. Our reported ROTCE in the fourth quarter was 9%, but as we highlight in the table, our ROTCE was impacted by a number of notable items.\nOur 2023 returns also reflected the benefit of rising rates, which helped to drive strong net interest income growth. And as I've already highlighted, we expect net interest income to decline this year. We still believe we have an achievable path to a sustainable 15% ROTCE over the medium term as we continue to make progress on transforming the company. There are several key factors that support our belief. Our ability to return excess capital, we currently have a significant amount of excess capital, 2.5 percentage points above our regulatory minimum buffers for CET1.\nAnd as I already highlighted, we expect to increase our share repurchases this year. I highlighted the progress we've already made to reposition our home lending business, including reducing the amount of third-party mortgage loan service by 18% from a year ago. As we continue to streamline this business, we expect the profitability to improve. We've grown our credit card business with balances up 40% since the end of 2021 and new accounts 25% higher than fourth quarter of 2021. However, the current profitability of this business has been impacted by acquisition costs and allowance builds and we expect profitability to improve as the portfolio matures.\nFinally, we've made significant investments in the last few years across our franchise to better serve our customers and help drive growth. We expect the revenue growth that these investments should generate in businesses like corporate investment banking and wealth and investment management will help fund additional investments. So we have many drivers to close the gap and improve returns. In summary, our results in 2023 demonstrated our commitment to improving our financial performance. We grew revenue, reduced expenses, increased capital returns to shareholders and maintained our strong capital position. We will now take your questions."

(Operator Instructions) Please note today's call is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the call over to John Campbell, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin the conference.\n\nJohn M. Campbell\n\nDirector of IR, Wells Fargo & Company\n\nThank you. Good morning. Thank you for joining our call today with our CEO, Charlie Scharf; and our CFO, Mike Santomassimo, who will discuss fourth quarter results and answer your questions. This call is being recorded. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our fourth quarter earnings materials, including the release, financial supplement and presentation deck are available on our website at wellsfargo.com.\nI'd also like to come that we may make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause the actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings including the Form 8-K filed today, containing our earnings materials. Information about any non-GAAP final measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings and the earnings materials available on our website.\nI will now turn the call over to Charlie.\n\nCharles W. Scharf\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Wells Fargo & Company\n\nThanks, John. I'll make some brief comments about our fourth quarter results, and then update you on our priorities. I'll then turn the call over to Mike to review fourth quarter results in more detail and some of our expectations for 2023 before we take your questions. Let me start with fourth quarter highlights. Our results were significantly impacted by previously disclosed operating losses, but our underlying performance reflected the continued progress we're making to improve returns.\nRising interest rates drove strong net interest income growth. Our continued progress and our efficiency initiatives helped to drive expenses lower excluding operating losses. Loans grew in both, our commercial and consumer portfolios. And charge-offs have continued to increase but credit quality remains strong.\nOur capital levels also remained very strong. And our CET1 ratio increased to 10.6%, well above our required minimum plus buffers. We also continue to make progress on putting legacy issues behind us. Our broad reaching agreement with the CFPB in December is an important step forward that helps us resolve multiple matters, the majority of which have been outstanding for several years.\nOver the past 3 years, we have made significant changes in the businesses referenced in the settlement. And many of the required actions were already substantially complete prior to this announcement. While our risk and regulatory work hasn't always followed a straight line and we have more to do, we've made significant progress, and we will continue to prioritize our work here. In addition to our risk and regulatory work, it's also critical for us to continue to invest in the future as we build off the great market positions we have.\nWe are confident our processes will enable us to continue to prioritize our risk and control work. At the same time, we invest in our future. And as I look back at '22, I'm enthusiastic about the progress we've made this past year and feel even better about the opportunities ahead. Let me start with the changes we've made during the year to help millions of customers avoid overdraft fees and meet short-term cash needs. These efforts included the elimination of non-sufficient funds fees and transfer fees for customers enrolled in overdraft protection, early payday making eligible direct deposits available up to 2 days early, extra day grace, giving eligible customers an extra business day to make deposits to avoid overdraft fees. And in the fourth quarter, we launched Flex Loan, a new digital-only small dollar loan that provides eligible customers convenient and affordable access to funds.\nTeams from across the company came together to roll out this new product in record time. The rollout has been smooth and though it's still early, customer response is exceeding our expectations. These actions build on services we've introduced over the past several years, including Clear Access Banking, our account with no overdraft fees.\nWe now have over 1.7 million of those accounts, up 48% from a year ago. We continue to transform the way we serve our customers by offering innovative products and solutions. We continue to improve our credit card offerings including launching 2 new cards, Wells Fargo Autograph and BILT. Our new products helped drive a 31% increase in new credit card accounts in 2022, while we continued to maintain strong credit profiles. We launched Wells Fargo Premier, our new offering dedicated to the financial needs of affluent clients by bringing together our branch-based and wealth-based businesses, to provide a more comprehensive, relevant and integrated offering for our clients.\nWe continue to enhance our partnership within our commercial business to bring corporate and investment banking products such as foreign exchange and M&A advisory services to our middle-market clients. Our different approach to technology is helping us better serve our consumer and corporate clients. We rolled out our new mobile app with a simpler, more intuitive user experience, which has improved customer satisfaction. In 2022, mobile active customers grew 4% from a year ago. We launched Intuitive Investor, making it easier for customers to invest with the streamlined account opening process and a lower minimum investments and total active Intuitive Investor accounts increased 56% from a year ago.\nWe completed the development of Fargo, our new AI-powered virtual assistant that provides a more personalized, convenient and simple banking experience, which is currently live for eligible employees and set to begin rolling out to customers early this year. Last month, we announced Vantage, our new enhanced digital experience for our commercial and corporate clients. Vantage uses AI and machine learning to provide a tailored and intuitive platform based on our clients' specific needs.\nOver the past year, our industry-leading API platform team continued the development of payment APIs for commercial and corporate clients invested in solutions to support our financial institution clients, ramps up in group product offerings in consumer lending and began developing commercial lending solutions. We are investing heavily in modernizing the IT infrastructure and the way we develop code. We're implementing a cloud-native operating model that allows us to innovate faster.\nWe've also been investing in modernization in the areas of payments and corporate lending, taking out legacy applications and digitizing processes end to end. These enhanced digital capabilities are just the start of initiatives we have planned as part of our multiyear digital transformation. We also continue to evaluate our existing businesses. As we announced earlier this week, we plan to create a more focused home lending business, aimed at serving primarily bank customers as well as individuals and families and minority communities.\nThis includes exiting the correspondent business and reducing the size of our servicing portfolio. I'm saying for some time that the mortgage business has changed dramatically since the financial crisis, and we've been adjusting our strategy accordingly. We're focused on our customers, profitability, returns and serving minority communities, not volume or market share.\nThe mortgage product is important to our customer base and the communities we serve, so it will remain important to us, but we do not need to be one of the biggest originators or services -- servicers in the industry to do this effectively. Across all of our businesses, we must evolve as the market regulation and competition has evolved. And while it may seem counterintuitive, we believe the decision to reduce risk in the mortgage business by reducing size and narrowing us will actually -- this will actually enable us to serve customers better and will also improve our returns in the long term.\nChanging gears now, I'm proud of all we did last year to make progress on our environmental, social and governance work. We are balanced in our approach to these issues and believe that thinking broadly about our stakeholders will enhance returns to shareholders, and we provide many examples on Slide 2 of our presentation. So let me just highlight 2 examples here. We published our first diversity, equity and inclusion report, which highlights the progress that we've made on our DE&I initiatives. We'll continue to make progress in our commitment to integrating DE&I into every aspect of the company under the new leadership of Kristy Fercho, which [will be] joining Wells Fargo in 2023 to lead our home lending business and was named the company's new Head of diverse segments, representation and inclusion in the fourth quarter.\nWe've commissioned an external third-party racial equity audit, and we plan to publish the results of the assessment by the end of this year. 2022 is a turning point in the economic cycle. The Federal Reserve has made clear that reducing inflation is its priority and it will continue to take actions necessary to achieve its goal.\nWe are starting to see the impact on consumer spend, credit, housing and demands for goods and services, but at this point, the impact of consumers and businesses has been manageable. And though there will certainly be some industries and segments of consumers that are more impacted than others, the rate impact we see in our customer base is not materially -- I'm sorry, the rate of impact we see in our customer base is not materially accelerating. This plus the strength with which consumers and businesses went into this slowing economy is a helpful set of facts as we look forward.\nOur customers have remained resilient with deposit balances, consumer spending and credit quality still stronger than pre-pandemic levels. As we look forward, we're carefully watching the impact of higher rates on our customers and expect to see deposit balances and credit quality continue to return toward pre-pandemic levels. While we're not predicting a severe downturn, we must be prepared for one, and we are stronger company than 1 and 2 years ago. Our margins are wider, our returns are higher. We're better managed, and our capital position is strong. So we feel prepared for a downside scenario if we see broader deterioration than we currently see or predict.\nWe still have clear opportunities to improve our performance as we make progress on our efficiency initiatives and continue to make the investments necessary to grow the business through technology and product enhancements. 2 years ago, we shared a path to higher ROTCE by returning capital to our shareholders and executing on our efficiency initiatives. While high levels of operating losses in the second half of '22 impacted our results, our underlying business performance demonstrated our ability to improve our returns.\nIn a moment, Mike will highlight the key drivers of our path to a 15% ROTCE, which we believe is achievable based on the strength of our business model and our ability to execute. While we're focused on improving our returns, making progress on building the appropriate risk and control and infrastructure for a company of our size and complexity will remain our top priority, and we will dedicate the time and resources necessary.\nI want to conclude by thanking our employees across the company who are working hard each day to continue to make progress in our transformation. I'm excited about all that we will accomplish in the year ahead.\nI'll now turn the call over to Mike.\n\nMichael P. Santomassimo\n\nSenior EVP & CFO, The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation\n\nThank you, Charlie. And good morning, everyone. Slides 2 and 3 summarize how we helped our customers, communities and employees last year, some of which Charlie covered. So I'm going to start with our fourth quarter financial results on Slide 4. Net income for the fourth quarter was $2.9 billion or $0.67 per diluted common share. Our fourth quarter results included $3.3 billion or $0.70 per share of operating losses primarily related to a variety of previously disclosed historical matters, including litigation, regulatory and customer remediation.\n$1 billion of impairment of equity securities or $749 million after noncontrolling interest, predominantly in our affiliated venture capital business, primarily driven by portfolio companies in the enterprise software sector. Both, slowing revenue growth rates and lower public market valuations of enterprise software companies impact the valuations.\nIt's important to note that even after recognizing this impairment, the current value of these investments at the end of 2022 remained above the amount of the initial investment. $353 million of severance expense, primarily in home lending. While we've reduced headcount in this business throughout 2022, this charge includes the actions we plan to take in 2023 related to the mortgage announcement we made earlier this week.\nThese reductions were partially offset by $510 million of discrete tax benefits related to interest and overpayments in prior years. We highlight capital on Slide 5. Our CET1 ratio was 10.6%, up approximately 30 basis points from the third quarter, reflecting the benefit from our fourth quarter earnings, the annual share issuance for our 401(k) plan matching contribution and an increase from AOCI.\nOur CET1 ratio remained well above our required regulatory minimum plus buffers, which increased by 10 basis points to 9.2% at the start of the fourth quarter as our new stress capital buffer took effect. As a reminder, our G-SIB surcharge will not increase in 2023. While we have not repurchased any common stock since the first quarter of 2022, we currently expect to resume share repurchases in the first quarter of this year.\nTurning to credit quality on Slide 7. Credit performance remained strong with 23 basis points of net charge-offs in the fourth quarter. However, as expected, losses are slowly increasing from historical lows, and we expect them to continue to return toward pre-pandemic levels over time, as the federal needs to take actions to combat high inflation.\nCredit performance remains wrong across our commercial businesses with only 6 base points of net charge-offs in the fourth quarter. Total consumer net charge-offs increased $88 million from the third quarter to 48 basis points of average loans, driven by an increase in net charge-offs in the credit card portfolio but remained slightly below consumer net charge-off levels in the fourth quarter of 2019.\nNonperforming assets increased 1% from the third quarter as lower residential mortgage nonaccrual loans were more than offset by higher commercial real estate nonaccrual loans. Our allowance for credit losses increased $397 million in the fourth quarter, primarily reflecting loan growth as well as a less favorable economic environment. We are closely monitoring our portfolio for potential risk and are continuing to take some targeted actions to further tighten underwriting standards.\nLet me highlight trends in 2 of our portfolios. The size of our auto portfolios declined for 3 consecutive quarters and balances were down 5% at the end of 2022 compared to year-end 2021. Meanwhile, originations were down 47% in the fourth quarter compared to a year ago which reflected credit tightening actions and continued price competition due to rising interest rates.\nOf note, our new vehicle originations surpassed used vehicles in the fourth quarter, reflecting a combination of credit tightening actions that we've implemented and the industry dynamic of higher new vehicle sales growth.\nTurning to the commercial real estate office portfolio. The office market is showing signs of weakness due to weak demand driving higher vacancy rates and deteriorating operating performance as well as challenging economic and capital market conditions. While we haven't seen this translate to significant loss content yet, we do expect to see stress over time and are proactively working with borrowers to manage our exposure and being disciplined in our underwriting standards with both, outstanding balances and (inaudible) down compared to a year ago.\nOn Slide 8, we highlight loans and deposits. Average loans grew 8% from a year ago and $3.1 billion from the third quarter. Period-end loans increased for the sixth consecutive quarter with growth across our commercial portfolios and higher consumer loans driven by credit card and residential loans, partially offset by continued declines in our auto portfolio.\nI'll highlight the specific growth drivers when discussing our operating segment results. Average loan yields increased 181 basis points from a year ago and 85 basis points from the third quarter, reflecting the higher rate environment. Average deposits declined 6% from a year ago, 2% from the third quarter. Compared with the third quarter, we saw declines in each of our business. Lower consumer balances reflected customers continuing to reallocate cash in higher-yielding alternatives, particularly in wealth and investment management and continued consumer spending.\nAs expected, our average deposit cost increased 32 basis points from the third quarter to 46 basis points driven by higher deposit costs across all operating segments in response to rising interest rates. Average deposit costs are up 44 basis points since the fourth quarter of 2021, while market rates have increased substantially more during that same time.\nAs rates continue to rise, we would expect deposit betas to continue to increase in customer migration from lower yielding to higher yielding deposit products to continue. Turning to net interest income on Slide 9. Fourth quarter net interest income was $13.4 billion which was 45% higher than a year ago as we continue to benefit from the impact of higher rates. I'll provide details on our '23 expectations later on the call.\nTurning to expenses on Slide 10. The increase in noninterest expense from both, a year ago and from the third quarter, was driven by higher operating losses. Excluding operating losses, other noninterest expense was flat from a year ago as higher severance expense was offset by lower revenue-related compensation and continued progress on our efficiency initiatives. Our operating losses in the fourth quarter included accruals related to the December 2022 CFPB consent order.\nAs part of that settlement, we agreed to 1 incremental remediation and 1 new remediation related to overdraft fees. The accrual related to these 2 remediations was approximately $350 million. Our operating losses in the fourth quarter also included accruals for other legal actions and reflecting these accruals, our current estimate of the high end of the range of reasonably possible losses and accessible for legal actions as of December 31, 2022, is approximately $1.4 billion.\nThis is down approximately $2.3 billion from September 30, 2022. While we still have outstanding litigation resolved, this estimate would be the lowest level since the second quarter of 2016 though, of course, new matters will arise and existing matters will develop over time. The estimate for December 31, 2022, will be updated at the time of our 10-K filing in February and may change. While we acknowledge the elevated level of operating losses, the past 2 quarters has been significant. They are important steps in putting historical issues behind us as we've been able to absorb the cost while increasing our CET1 ratio as I highlighted earlier.\nTurning to our operating segments, starting with Consumer Banking and Lending on Slide 11. Consumer and Small Business Banking revenue increased 36% from a year ago driven by the impact of higher interest rates. Deposit-related fees continued to decline as we completed the rollout of the overdraft fee reductions and new product enhancements that we announced early last year to help customers avoid overdraft fees.\nThe majority of the revenue impact of these changes was reflected in the fourth quarter run rate. We continue to focus on branch rationalization as digital adoption and usage among our customer are steadily increased. In 2022, we reduced branches by 179 and branch staffing levels by 10%, and we expect to continue to optimize our branches and staffing levels in response to changing customer needs.\nWhile industry mortgage rates declined in the fourth quarter, they were still up over 330 basis points since the beginning of the year, including mortgage applications as measured by the Mortgage Bankers Association. We're at a 26-year low at quarter end. The economic incentive to refinance is extremely limited. And refinance applications for the industry were down 87% in December compared to a year ago.\nReflecting these market conditions, our home lending revenue declined 57% from a year ago, driven by lower mortgage originations and gain on sale margins as well as lower revenue from the resecuritization of loans purchased from securitization pools. We expect the mortgage origination market will continue to be challenging and gain on sale margin or remain under pressure until excess capacity industry has been removed.\nAs we announced this week, we will be exiting our correspondent business, which we expect to be substantially complete by the end of the first quarter. We don't expect this action to have a significant impact on our 2023 financial results. Credit card revenue was up 6% from a year ago due to higher loan balances driven by higher point of sale volume and new product launches. Auto revenue declined 12% from the year ago driven by continued loan spread compression from rising rates and credit tightening actions in certain areas as well as lower loan balances.\nPersonal lending was up 9% from a year ago due to higher loan balances, partially offset by lower spread compression. While originations grew 19% from the year ago driven by strong consumer demand in investments and the business, we have remained disciplined in our underwriting.\nTurning to key business drivers on Slide 12. Mortgage originations declined 70% from a year ago and 32% from the third quarter, with both declines in correspondent and retail and originations. Refinances as a percentage of total originations were over half of our volume a year ago to declined to 13% in the fourth quarter of 2022.\nI already highlighted the drivers of the decline in auto originations. So turning to debit card. Spending was up 1% compared to a year ago. Holiday spend for debit card was flat compared to the 2021 season with lower transaction volume, offset by higher average [ticket] size. Entertainment was the only category with double-digit spending while growth -- while categories such as home improvement, general retail goods and [fuel] were all down compared to 2021.\nCredit card spending increased 17% from a year ago, and while the year-over-year growth rate slowed from the third quarter, almost all categories continue to have double-digit growth. Average balances were up 22% from a year ago. Payment rates have started to moderate, but we're still well above pre-pandemic levels.\nTurning to Commercial Banking results on Slide 13. Middle Market Banking revenue increased 78% from a year ago, driven by higher net interest income due to the impact of higher rates and higher loan balances. Asset-based lending and leasing revenue declined 4% from a year ago, driven by lower net gains from equity securities, partially offset by loan growth. Average loan balances were up 18% in the fourth quarter compared to a year ago, while growth in the first half of 2022 was driven by higher [line] utilization. Utilization rates stabilized in the second half of the year.\nAverage loan balances have grown for 6 consecutive quarters and were up 5% in the third quarter, with growth in asset-based lending and leasing driven by continued growth in client inventory, which are still below pre-pandemic levels. Growth in middle market banking was driven by larger clients, including both, new and existing relationships, which more than offset declines from our smaller customers.\nTurning to Corporate and Investment Banking on Slide 14. Banking revenue increased 22% from a year ago driven by stronger treasury management results due to the impact of higher interest rates as well as improved lending results. Investment banking fees declined from a year ago, reflecting lower market activity with declines across all products and industries.\nCommercial real estate revenue grew 16% from a year ago driven by stronger lending results to a higher loan balances and the impact of higher interest rates. Markets revenues increased 17% from a year ago, driven by higher trading revenue in equities, rates and commodities, foreign exchange and municipal products.\nAverage loans grew 10% from a year ago after growing for seventh consecutive quarter, average loans declined from the third quarter as utilization rates stabilized across most portfolios. On Slide 15, Wealth and Investment Management revenue was up 1% compared to a year ago, as the increase in net interest income driven by the impact of higher rates was partially offset by lower asset-based fees due to the decrease in market valuations.\nThe majority of [win] advisory assets are priced at the beginning of the quarter, so asset-based increased slightly in the first quarter, reflecting the higher market valuations at the end of the year. Expenses decreased 6% from a year ago, driven by lower revenue-related compensation and the impact of efficiency initiatives. Even as loan growth in securities-based lending moderated due to demand caused by market volatility in the interest rate environment, average loans grew 1% from a year ago.\nSlide 16 highlights our corporate results. Both, revenue and expenses were impacted by the divestitures last year of our Corporate Trust business in Wells Fargo Asset Management. We sold these businesses in the fourth quarter of 2021, which resulted in a net gain of $943 million.\nRevenue also declined from a year ago due to lower results in our affiliated venture capital and private equity businesses, including the impairments, equity securities I highlighted earlier. The increase in expenses from a year ago was driven by higher operating losses.\nTurning to our expectations for '23, starting on Slide 17. Let me start by highlighting our expectations for net interest income. We are assuming that -- we are assuming the asset cap will remain in place throughout the year. Moving from left to right on the waterfall based on the current forward rate curve, we expect our net interest income will continue to benefit from the impact of higher rates even with deposits repricing faster than they did in 2022.\nHowever, this benefit is expected to be partially offset by continued deposit runoff and mix shift to higher-yielding products with these declines, partially offset by modest loan growth. We also expect a headwind for lower CIB Markets net interest income due to higher funding costs. This reduction is expected to be partially offset by an increase in trading gains and noninterest income, so the impact to revenue is currently expected to be small.\nPutting this all together, we currently expect net interest income to grow by approximately 10% in 2023 versus 2022. Ultimately, the amount of net interest income we earned in 2023 will depend on a variety of factors, many of which are uncertain including the absolute level of interest rates, the shape of the yield curve, deposit balances, mix and pricing in the loan demand.\nTurning to our 2023 expense outlook on Slide 18. Following the waterfall from left to right, we reported $57.3 billion in noninterest expense in 2022, which included $7 billion of operating losses. Excluding operating losses, expenses would have been $50.3 billion, which is -- which was in line with the guidance we provided at the beginning of last year. If you also exclude operating losses from the guidance, our 2022 expenses were impacted by inflation and higher severance expense.\nHowever, revenue-related expenses were lower than expected by market conditions. So we believe a good starting point for discussion for -- of 2023 expenses was $50.3 billion, which excludes operating losses. We expect expenses in 2023 to increase by approximately $1 billion due to both, merit increases, including inflationary pressures and an approximately $250 million increase in FDIC expense related to the previously announced surcharge.\nThese increases are expected to be partially offset by approximately $100 million of lower revenue-related expense, primarily driven by decreases in [loan] lending. Based on current market levels, we expect revenue-related expense in Wealth and Investment Management for 2023 to be similar to 2022. We've successfully delivered on our commitment of approximately $7.5 billion of gross expense saves over the past 2 years and through our efficiency initiatives, we expect to realize an additional $3.2 billion of gross expense reductions in 2023.\nA piece of this is related to the announcement we made earlier this week to create a more focused home lending business but expense savings from reducing our servicing business will take more time to be realized.\nWe highlighted on this slide the largest opportunities for additional savings this year, and we believe we'll have more opportunities beyond 2023. Similar to prior years, the resources needed to address our risk and control work separate from our efficiency initiatives. And we will continue to add resources as necessary to complete this important work.\nAnd while we continue to focus on executing our efficiency initiatives, we're also continuing to invest and expect approximately $1.7 billion of incremental investments in our businesses in 2023. As Charlie discussed, investing in our businesses is critical to our (inaudible) growth across the company and better serve our customers, but we'll also continue to be thoughtful and evaluate the level of investments throughout the year.\nSo putting this all together, expenses, excluding operating losses are expected to be relatively flat in 2023 compared with 2022, even with inflationary pressures, a higher FDI surcharge and increase incremental investments in our businesses.\nAs 2022 demonstrated, operating losses can be significant and hard to predict, and therefore, we have not included them in our expense outlook for 2023. However, we currently anticipate ongoing business-related operating losses, such as fraud, theft and other business as usual losses to be approximately $1.3 billion this year, which is the same assumption we provided last year. As previously disclosed, we had an outstanding litigation -- have outstanding litigation, regulatory and customer remediation matters that could impact the amount of operating losses.\nIt's important to note that while we made substantial progress executing on our efficiency initiatives, we still have a significant opportunity to get more efficient across the company. This remains a multiyear process with the goal of achieving an efficiency ratio along with our peers based on our business mix.\nGiven how critical continuing to invest (inaudible), on Slide 19, we provide details on our primary areas of focus for 2023. As we've highlighted, continuing to build the right risk and control of infrastructure remains our top priority, and we will continue to invest in this important work. Charlie discussed many of the investments we started to make in digital payments, and we plan to continue to invest in these areas this year to make improvements for both, our consumer and commercial customers.\nWe also plan to continue to invest to expand our client coverage and investment banking, commercial banking and wealth and investment management and to continue to transform our technology platforms, including moving more applications to cloud, consolidating our data centers and increasing investments in cyber.\nFinally, by investing in our operations and branches, we expect not only to improve the customer experience, but also improve efficiency, reduce operational risk and drive [an account] growth. As we show on Slide 20, in the fourth quarter, we reported an 8% ROTCE, but as I highlighted at the start of the call, our fourth quarter results were impacted by several notable items, including higher operating losses, elevated impairments of equity securities, severance and discrete tax benefits.\nAs we show on this slide, you will -- if you exclude these notable items, our fourth quarter ROTCE would have been approximately 16%. However, we don't believe this accurately reflects our longer-term expectations for the following reasons. Net interest income was higher than our long-term expectations due to interest rates, funding, penalties, mix and pricing, Also, net loan charge-offs were at historically low levels. If rates, funding balances, mix and pricing were closer to our long-term expectations and charge-offs were higher, our ROTCE would be lower. Depending on what adjustments you make here, we may all get to a slightly different answer. So to be clear, because the interest rates are higher and freight costs are lower than our longer-term expectations, we believe we have more work to do to improve our returns.\nOn Slide 21, we highlight our path to higher returns. Since we first discussed our ROTCE goal in the earnings call for the fourth quarter of 2020, we have executed on a number of important items. We executed a $20 billion of gross common stock repurchases, $16 billion in net issuances including our 401(k) plan. We increased our common stock dividend from $0.10 to $0.30 per share. We delivered approximately $7.5 billion of gross expense saves and reduced headcount by 11% since the end of 2020.\nSo we've made good progress over the past 2 years on things that we can control, and we believe we have a clear line of sight to a sustainable ROTCE of approximately 15% in the medium term. In order to achieve that, we need to continue to optimize our capital, including returning capital to shareholders and redeploying capital to higher-returning products and businesses. Adding more focus on our home lending business should also be a positive contributor to higher returns. We also have additional opportunities to execute on efficiency initiatives. Additionally, we expect to benefit from the investments we are planning in our businesses, which I highlighted earlier.\nWhile some of these investments will be dependent on the market environment, we expect them to increase ROTCE. At the same time, we will continue to prioritize building our risk and control infrastructure. In the longer term, we believe that running a company in a more controlled and disciplined manner will continue to benefit returns. And our goal is for our 4 operating segments to produce returns comparable to our best peers.\nIn summary, although the high level of operating losses we had in the fourth quarter significantly impacted our results, the underlying results in the quarter continue to reflect an improvement in our earnings capacity. As we look forward, we expect to continue to grow net interest income and our expenses, excluding operating losses are expected to be relatively flat even after inflation and incremental investments in our businesses to drive growth.\nBoth, our credit performance and capital levels, remained strong in the fourth quarter. And we expect to resume share repurchases in the first quarter. We will now take your questions."

[Operator Instructions] Please note that today's call is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the call over to John Campbell, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin the conference.\n\nJohn M. Campbell\n\nDirector-Investor Relations, Wells Fargo & Co.\n\nGood morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today where our CEO, Charlie Scharf; and our CFO, Mike Santomassimo, will discuss third quarter results and answer your questions. This call is being recorded.\nBefore we get started, I would like to remind you that our third quarter earnings materials, including the release, financial supplement and presentation deck, are available on our website at wellsfargo.com. I'd also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings, including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings materials. Information about any non-GAAP financials referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings and the earnings materials available on our website.\nI will now turn the call over to Charlie.\n\nCharles W. Scharf\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Visa, Inc.\n\nThanks very much, John. I'll make some brief comments about our third quarter results and update you on our priorities. I'll then turn the call over to Mike to review third quarter results in more detail before we take your questions.\nLet me start with some third quarter highlights. Our results reflected the progress we're making to improve our financial performance. Revenue, pretax provision profit, net income, diluted earnings per common share and ROTCE were all higher than a year ago. Our revenue reflected strong net interest income growth as well as higher noninterest income as we benefited from higher rates and the investments we're making in our businesses. Our expenses declined from a year ago due to lower operating losses.\nAs expected, net charge-offs have continued to increase from historical low levels, and we increased our allowance for credit losses primarily driven by our office portfolio as well as growth in our credit card portfolio. Average commercial and consumer loans were both down from the second quarter as higher rates and a slowing economy have weakened loan demand, and we've continued to take some credit tightening actions.\nAverage deposits also declined from the second quarter and a year ago driven by consumer spending as well as customers migrating to higher-yielding alternatives. Consumer spending remains strong with third quarter year-over-year growth rates for both credit and debit card spending increasing from the second quarter.\nNow let me update you on the progress we're making on our strategic priorities, starting with risk and control work, which remains our top priority. As time goes on, we continue to make the progress necessary to complete our work. I've said that we have detailed project plans which track interim deliverables, not just the date the work is to be finalized and turned over to the regulators for validation.\nThe work is not finalized all at once. It's not as if there's a big bang conversion at the conclusion of a big body of work. It's just the opposite. Building our risk and control framework is a continuous ongoing effort. We are implementing changes throughout the life of the project, and we track effectiveness along the way.\nThe numerous internal metrics we track show that the work is clearly improving our control environment, but we will not be satisfied until all of our work is complete. We remain focused on the work ahead even as we are making progress. But I will repeat what I've said in the past: regulatory pressure on banks with long-standing issues such as ours continues to grow. And until we complete our work and until it is validated by our regulators, we remain at risk of further regulatory actions. Additionally, until our work is complete, we could find new issues that need to be remediated, and these may result in additional regulatory actions.\nWe also continued to take steps to advance our business strategy, which includes focusing on our core business and customers. We sold approximately $2 billion of private equity investments in certain Norwest Equity Partners and Norwest Mezzanine Partners funds. We are also making a number of investments to better serve our customers.\nAs a leader in U.S. middle-market and asset-based lending, we're focused on finding ways to support our clients with the recently announced strategic relationship with Centerbridge Partners. Our middle-market clients will have greater access to alternative sources of capital that can be used to pursue a broader set of growth and value-creation initiatives across a variety of market conditions. Branches continue to play an important role in the way we serve our customers, and we continue to optimize our network, but we also look at targeted expansions in markets where we see opportunities for our franchise.\nLast week, we announced we are expanding our branch network in Chicago, where we only have 7 branches today. We also continue to make enhancements to our mobile app. And in the third quarter, we launched Stock Fractions, giving Wells trade clients the ability to buy fractions of company's stocks to help build a diversified portfolio regardless of stock price.\nJust yesterday, we announced the expanded availability of LifeSync to all consumer customers. Available on the mobile app, LifeSync is our personalized digital approach to aligning customers' goals with their money and was launched to all Wealth and Investment Management clients earlier this year. Customers' goals entered in LifeSync will be visible to bankers to enhance need-based conversations.\nWe also expanded the capabilities of Fargo, our AI-powered virtual assistant and recently added the ability for customers to communicate with Fargo in Spanish. These enhanced capabilities are just the latest of our ongoing investments to deliver seamless and consistent experiences across all our channels. We are seeing more mobile adoption momentum, adding over 520,000 mobile active users in the third quarter, our best quarterly growth since first quarter of 2021.\nWe've also continued to make important hires who bring expertise to Wells Fargo and businesses we're looking to grow. Before I highlight some of our new leaders, I'd like to take this opportunity to thank Bill Daley, Vice Chairman of Public Affairs, who's retiring at the end of this year for all he has accomplished since he joined the company in 2019. Bill has been an invaluable asset to the company, and we benefited from his long experience in both the public and private sectors.\nDuring this time at Wells Fargo, he helped strengthen our relationships with communities we serve, established new programs in housing and small business, and worked to rebuild our reputation both locally and nationally.\nI'm pleased to have announced that Tom Janis joined Wells Fargo as Vice Chairman earlier this month. Tom will be a close adviser to the senior management team on a range of issues, and he will work alongside our business leaders as we continue to expand our relationships with clients. The breadth of Tom's experience across the public and private sectors will be an important asset to us as we continue to move the company ahead.\nWe continue to invest in our Corporate Investment Banking business with new co-heads of equity capital markets. These new hires complement the other important hires we've been making over the past year. We also hired a new Head of Trust Services and Chief Fiduciary Officer in our Wealth and Investment Management segment and a new Head of Affluent and Premier Banking in consumer, small and business banking.\nWe also continue to focus on better serving our communities. During the third quarter, we published 3 reports that provide an overview of the work we are doing to build a sustainable, inclusive future in communities we serve; outline our strategic approach to managing the risks associated with climate change in deploying capital to support the transition to a low-carbon economy; and describe our methodology for aligning our financial portfolios with pathways to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 and presenting interim emissions-based targets to track that alignment.\nWe continue to make progress on our special-purpose credit program initiative we announced last year to help drive economic growth, sustainable homeownership and neighborhood stability in minority communities. We recently expanded our special-purpose refinance offers to prequalified Hispanic customers with Wells Fargo mortgages to refinance at a lower than market rate. The program launched last year for Black or African American customers has seen strong results, and the Hispanic offer has shown similar levels of customer engagement.\nWe also announced that we're offering a $10,000 homebuyer access grant that will be applied towards down payment for eligible homebuyers who currently within work purchasing homes in certain underserved communities in 8 metropolitan areas. And we now have 14 HOPE Inside centers of Wells Fargo branches, including the first focusing on serving the Navajo community. The centers help engage and empower communities to achieve their financial goals through financial education workshops and free one-on-one coaching.\nLooking ahead, the U.S. economy has continued to be resilient with key support from the labor strength -- from the labor market and strength in consumer spending. Delinquencies have continued to deteriorate at a relatively slow consistent rate without signs of acceleration across our portfolios. Our base case remains a continued slowing of the economy, but we remain prepared for a wide range of scenarios given there is still significant uncertainty ahead.\nRegarding capital, the Basel III endgame proposal included higher capital requirements as we expected. It's a complicated set of rules. But at this point, if nothing changed and we didn't take actions, we estimate that our RWA would increase by approximately 20%. There are some items that increased our capital requirements that we are hopeful will be adjusted, and we will be participating and sharing our perspectives on the proposed rules during the 120-day comment period.\nAdditionally, we are evaluating changes we may make based on the proposed rules. Fortunately, we come into this from a strong position as our current capital levels are above the estimated regulatory minimum plus buffers. However, we still need to decide how much of an additional buffer we want to maintain and what mitigating actions we may want to take to reduce the impact of the new rules.\nAt this point, we still see a path to concurrently increasing our level of CET1, as appropriate, increase our dividend and repurchasing common stock. Levels of each will be influenced by CCAR, the finalization of the proposed rules and economic conditions.\nI'll now turn the call over to Mike.\n\nMichael P. Santomassimo\n\nSenior EVP & CFO, The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation\n\nThank you, Charlie, and good morning, everyone. Net income for the third quarter was $5.8 billion or $1.48 per diluted common share, both up from the second quarter and a year ago. Our third quarter results included $349 million or $0.09 per share of discrete tax benefits related to the resolution of prior period tax matters.\nTurning to capital and liquidity on Slide 3. Our CET1 ratio increased to 11% in the third quarter, 2.1 percentage points above our new regulatory minimum plus buffers effective on October 1. This was up from 10.7% in the second quarter as higher earnings, the approximately 14 basis point benefit from the sale of certain private equity investments and lower risk-weighted assets were only partially offset by share repurchases and dividends.\nDuring the third quarter, we repurchased $1.5 billion in common stock. Our strong capital levels position us well for the anticipated increases related to the volatile [ freeing ] proposal released in the third quarter. Based on where we ended the quarter, we estimate that our CET1 ratio would be 50 basis points above the fully phased-in required minimum if the proposed rules were implemented as written after factoring the growth in RWAs and the resulting decline in our stress capital buffer as well as the impact of the new G-SIB buffer calculation changes.\nImportantly, this is an early estimate, subject to change and is before any actions we may take to mitigate the impact of the new rules. Looking forward, we expect to continue to have capacity to increase our CET1 ratio, while we plan to continue to repurchase shares as we wait for the capital rules to be finalized.\nTurning to credit quality on Slide 5. As we expected, net loan charge-offs continue to increase, up 4 basis points from the second quarter to 36 basis points of average loans. Commercial net loan charge-offs declined modestly from the second quarter to 13 basis points of average loans as lower losses in our commercial and industrial portfolio were partially offset by $14 million of higher losses in commercial real estate.\nWe had $32.2 billion of office loans, down 3% from the second quarter, which represented 3% of our total loans outstanding. Vacancy rates continue to be high and the office market remains weak. Our CRE teams continue to focus on monitoring and derisking the portfolio, which includes reducing exposures.\nAs we highlighted in the past, each property situation is different and the remaining variables that could determine performance, which is why we regularly review this portfolio. As expected, consumer net loan charge-offs continued to increase and were up $98 million from the second quarter to 67 basis points of average loans. Residential mortgage loans continued to have net recoveries, while our other consumer portfolios all had higher losses with the largest increase in our auto portfolio, which was up from the second quarter seasonal lows.\nNonperforming assets increased 17% from the second quarter as growth in commercial real estate nonaccrual loans more than offset the decline in commercial and industrial as well as modest declines across all consumer portfolios. The decline in commercial industrial nonaccrual loans was primarily due to payoffs and paydowns, which is a good reminder that the resolution of nonperforming assets doesn't always result in charge-offs. The increase in commercial real estate nonaccrual loans was driven by a $1.3 billion increase in the office nonaccrual loan.\nMoving to Slide 6. Our allowance for credit losses increased $333 million in the third quarter primarily for commercial real estate office loans as well as for higher credit card loan balances, which was partially offset by a lower allowance for auto loans. Since the composition of our office portfolio is relatively consistent with what we shared with you in the past few quarters, we did not include a separate commercial real estate slide this quarter. However, we did update the table showing the allowance for credit losses coverage ratio for commercial real estate, including the breakdown of the office portfolio.\nWe've not seen significant increases in charge-offs in our commercial real estate office portfolio yet. However, we do expect higher losses over time, and we continue to increase the coverage ratio in our commercial and -- our CIB commercial real estate office portfolio from 8.8% at the end of the second quarter to 10.8% at the end of the third quarter.\nOn Slide 7, we highlight loans and deposits. Average loans were down modestly from both the second quarter and a year ago. While we continue to have good growth in credit card loans from the second quarter, most other portfolios declined. I'll highlight specific drivers when discussing our operating segment results.\nAverage loan yields increased 195 basis points from a year ago and 24 basis points from the second quarter due to the higher interest rate environment. Average deposits declined 5% from a year ago predominantly driven by deposit outflows in our consumer and wealth businesses, reflecting continued consumer spending and customers reallocating cash into higher-yielding alternatives. Average deposits also declined in Commercial Banking, while they stabilized in Corporate and Investment Banking.\nAs expected, our average deposit costs continued to increase, up 23 basis points from the second quarter of 236 basis points with higher deposit costs across all operating segments in response to rising interest rates. However, the pace of the increase has slowed, and our percentage of average noninterest-bearing deposits decreased modestly from the second quarter to 29% but remained above prepandemic levels.\nTurning to net interest income on Slide 8. Third quarter net interest income was $13.1 billion, up 8% from a year ago, as we continued to benefit from the impact of higher rates. The $58 million decline from the second quarter was due to lower average deposit balances, partially offset by 1 additional day in the quarter and the impact of higher interest rates.\nLast quarter, we increased our expectations for full year 2023 net interest income growth to approximately 14% compared with 2022, which was up from our expectation of 10% growth at the beginning of the year. We now expect full year 2023 net interest income growth to grow by approximately 16% compared with 2022 with the fourth quarter 2023 net interest income expected to be approximately $12.7 billion. The expected decline in interest income in the fourth quarter was primarily driven by our assumptions for additional deposit outflows and migration from noninterest-bearing to interest-bearing deposits as well as continued deposit repricing, including continued competitive pricing on commercial deposits.\nTurning to expenses on Slide 9. Noninterest expense declined from a year ago driven by lower operating losses and increased 1% from the second quarter driven by higher operating losses, severance expense and revenue-related comp. Last quarter, we updated our expectations for full year 2023 noninterest expense excluding operating losses to approximately $51 billion. We now expect it to be approximately $51.5 billion or approximately $12.6 billion in the fourth quarter. The increase reflects additional severance and other onetime costs, revenue-related compensation and some lags in realizing efficiency saves.\nWe've reduced head count every quarter since the third quarter of 2020, and it was down 3% in the second quarter and 5% from a year ago. We believe we still have additional opportunities to reduce head count and attrition has remained low, which will likely result in additional severance expense for actions in 2024. We are working through our efficiency plans now as part of the budget process.\nAdditionally, if the FDIC deposit special assessment related to the events from earlier in the year was finalized in the fourth quarter, it would increase our expected fourth quarter expenses. And finally, as a reminder, we have outstanding litigation, regulatory and customer remediation matters that could impact operating results.\nTurning to our operating segments, starting with Consumer Banking and Lending on Slide 10. Consumer, small and business banking revenue increased 7% from a year ago as higher net interest income driven by the impact of higher interest rates was partially offset by lower deposit-related fees driven by the overdraft policy changes we rolled out last year. Charlie highlighted the investments we were making in our Chicago branch network, and we're also making investments in refurbishing branches across our existing network.\nAdditionally, we are bringing our digital onboarding experience to our branches, creating a fast and easy experience for our customers. At the same time, we've reduced our total number of branches by 6% from a year ago.\nHome lending revenue declined 14% from a year ago due to a decline in mortgage banking income driven by lower originations in servicing income, which included the impact of sales of mortgage servicing rights. We continue to reduce head count in home lending in the third quarter, down 37% from a year ago, and we expect staffing levels will continue to decline.\nCredit card revenue increased 2% from a year ago due to higher loan balances, partially offset by introductory promotional rates and higher credit card rewards expense. Payment rates have been relatively stable over the past year and remained above prepandemic levels. New account growth continued to be strong, up 22% from a year ago, reflecting the continued success of our new products and increased marketing. Importantly, the quality of the new accounts continue to be better than what we were booking historically. While the majority of new cards were to existing Wells Fargo customers, we're increasingly attracting more customers that are new to Wells Fargo.\nAuto revenue declined 15% from a year ago driven by continued loan spread compression and lower loan balances. Personal lending revenue is up 14% from a year ago due to higher loan balances.\nTurning to some key business drivers on Slide 11. Mortgage originations declined 70% from a year ago and 18% in the second quarter. We continue to make progress on the strategic plans we announced earlier this year, including focusing on serving Wells Fargo Bank customers as well as borrowers and minority communities. We did not originate or fund any correspondent mortgages in the third quarter.\nThe size of our auto portfolio has declined for 6 consecutive quarters, and balances were down 9% at the end of the third quarter compared to a year ago. Origination volumes declined 24% from a year ago, reflecting credit tightening actions as well as continued price competition. Our origination mix continue to shift towards higher FICO scores, reflecting the credit tightening actions we've taken over the past year.\nDebit card spend increased 2% from a year ago with growth in most categories offsetting declines in fuel, home improvement and travel. Credit card spending continued to be strong and was up 15% from a year ago. All categories grew from a year ago, including fuel, which rebounded after declining in the second quarter.\nTurning to Commercial Banking results on Slide 12. Middle Market Banking revenue increased 23% from a year ago due to the impact of higher interest rates and higher loan balances. Asset-based lending and leasing revenue increased 3% year-over-year due to higher loan balances as well as higher revenue from renewable energy investments. Loan balances were up 7% in the third quarter compared to a year ago driven by growth in asset-based line leasing. Average loans were down 1% in the second quarter due to declines in Middle Market Banking. After increasing the first half of the year, revolver utilization rates declined in the third quarter to levels similar to a year ago.\nTurning to Corporate Investment Banking on Slide 13. Banking revenue increased 20% from a year ago driven by higher lending revenue, stronger treasury management results reflecting the impact of higher interest rates, and higher investment banking revenue reflecting increased activity across all products. As Charlie highlighted, we've continued to hire experienced bankers, helping us deliver for our clients and positioning us well when markets improve.\nCommercial real estate revenue grew 14% from a year ago, reflecting the impact of higher interest rates and higher revenue in our low-income housing business, partially offset by lower loan and deposit balances. Markets revenue increased 33% from a year ago driven by higher revenue in structured products, equities, credit products and foreign exchange. We've had strong trading results for 3 consecutive quarters as we benefited from market volatility and the investments we've made in technology and talent to grow this business.\nAverage loans were down 5% from a year ago driven by banking, reflecting a combination of slower demand payoffs and modestly lower line utilization. Average loan balances were stable with the second quarter.\nOn Slide 14, Wealth and Investment Management revenue increased 1% compared to a year ago driven by higher asset-based fees due to the increased market valuations. Net interest income declined from a year ago driven by lower deposit balances as customers continue to reallocate cash into higher-yielding alternatives as well as lower loan balances. While average deposits were down compared to both the second quarter and a year ago, the pace of the decline slowed in the third quarter.\nAs a reminder, the majority of WIM, Wealth and Investment Management, advisory assets were priced at the beginning of the quarter, so third quarter results reflected market valuations as of July 1, which were higher from a year ago. Asset-based fees in the fourth quarter will reflect market valuations as of October 1, which were also higher from a year ago but were lower from the third quarter pricing date. Average loans were down 4% from a year ago primarily due to a decline in securities-based lending.\nSlide 15 highlights our corporate results. This segment includes venture capital and private equity investments, including the investments and funds that we sold in the third quarter. The sale had a nominal impact on third quarter net income. Revenue declined $345 million from a year ago, reflecting assumption changes related to the valuation of our Visa B common stock exposure as well as lower venture capital revenue.\nIn summary, our results in the third quarter reflected a continued improvement in our financial performance. During the first 9 months of this year, we had strong growth in revenue, pretax provision profit and diluted earnings per share compared to a year ago. As expected, our net charge-offs have continued to slowly increase from historical lows, and we increased our allowance for credit losses by over $1.9 billion this year primarily for CRE office loans and higher credit for loan balances. We are closely monitoring our portfolios and taking credit tightening actions where we believe appropriate. Our capital levels have increased, and we expect to continue to return excess capital to shareholders.\nWe will now take your questions."

(Operator Instructions) Please note that today's call is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the call over to your host, John Campbell, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin the conference.\n\nJohn M. Campbell\n\nDirector of IR, Wells Fargo & Company\n\nGood morning. Thank you for joining our call today where our CEO, Charlie Scharf; and our CFO, Mike Santomassimo, will discuss second quarter results and answer your questions. This call is being recorded.\nBefore we get started, I would like to remind you that our second quarter earnings materials, including the release, financial supplement and presentation deck, are available on our website at wellsfargo.com. I'd also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings, including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings materials.\nInformation about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings and the earnings materials available on our website. I will now turn the call over to Charlie.\n\nCharles W. Scharf\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Wells Fargo & Company\n\nThanks very much, John. Good morning. I'll make some brief comments about our second quarter results, the operating environment and update you on our priorities. I'll then turn the call over to Mike to review second quarter results in more detail before we take your questions.\nLet me start with some second quarter highlights. We earned $3.1 billion in the second quarter. Our results included a $576 million impairment of equity securities, predominantly in our venture capital business due to market conditions.\nRevenue declined as growth in net interest income driven by rising interest rates and higher loan balances was more than offset by lower noninterest income as market conditions negatively impacted our venture capital, mortgage banking, investment banking and wealth management advisory businesses. We continued to execute on our efficiency initiatives, and our expenses declined from a year ago even with inflationary pressures and higher operating losses.\nWe had broad-based loan growth with both our consumer and commercial portfolios growing from the first quarter and a year ago. Credit performance remained strong. Our allowance reflected an increase due to loan growth.\nWhile we're monitoring risks related to continued high inflation, increasing interest rates and the slowing economy, which will impact our customers, consumers and businesses have been resilient so far. When looking at simple averages across our entire portfolio, consumer deposit balances per account increased from first quarter and a year ago and remained above pre-pandemic levels.\nOverall, our consumer deposit customers' health indicators, including cash flow, payroll and overdraft trends are not showing elevated risk concerns. However, we're closely monitoring activity by segment for signs of potential stress. And for certain cohorts of customers, we have seen average balances steadily decline to pre-pandemic levels following the final Federal stimulus payments early last year, and their debit card spend has also been declining.\nOverall, debit card spending was up 3% compared to a year ago when consumers received stimulus payments. And inflation appears to be impacting certain categories of spending, including a 26% increase in fuel driven by higher prices, while discretionary categories like apparel and home improvement spending were down double digits, driven by fewer transactions.\nCredit card spend increased 28% from a year ago, above the industry trend driven by the new products we launched last year, with double-digit increases across all spend categories. However, spending, while still strong, started to slow in May and June. Consumer credit card utilization rates remain below pre-pandemic levels. Payment rates remained strong and delinquency rates remain low.\nOur small business portfolio continues to perform well in the aggregate in both delinquencies and losses. Leading indicators such as payment rates, deposit levels, utilization and revolving debt trends do not yet indicate signs of stress. Loan demand from our commercial customers remain strong with broad-based balance and commitment growth.\nOur commercial customers' credit performance remained strong with exceptionally low net charge-offs, and nonaccrual loans were at their lowest level in over 10 years. However, we are monitoring early warning indicators across portfolios including cash flow activity, credit line utilization rates and industry fundamentals for inflation impacts.\nNow let me update you on progress we've made on our strategic priorities. Our work to build an appropriate risk and control infrastructure is ongoing and remains our top priority, but we also continue to invest in our businesses to better serve our customers and to help drive growth. This week, we launched our fourth new credit card offering in the past year, Wells Fargo Autograph. Our latest card reflects our momentum in growing our consumer credit card business with new accounts up over 60% from a year ago. We're focused on delivering competitive offerings, and our new reward card provides 3x points across top spending categories including restaurants, travel and gas stations. This is the first of several rewards-based cards we plan to introduce. We continued to improve the digital experience in the second quarter with the relaunch of Intuitive Investor, our automated digital investing platform. We simplified the account opening process and created a faster and better experience for both new and experienced investors.\nDuring the second quarter, we began rolling out Wells Fargo Premier, which provides differentiated products and experiences focused on strengthening and growing our affluent client relationships. We are working towards offering one set of products and services that are tailored to the needs of these customers regardless of where they sit within our individual businesses. We will be rolling out more enhancements in the coming quarters to provide a more compelling offering for premier clients.\nWe started to roll out overdraft policy changes late in the first quarter, which included the elimination of fees for non-sufficient funds and overdraft protection transactions. Additional changes will be rolled out in the second half of this year, including providing customers who overdraw their account with a 25-hour grace period to cure a negative balance before incurring an overdraft fee, giving early access to eligible direct deposits and providing a new easy short-term credit product. We expect these changes will help millions of consumer customers avoid overdraft fees and meet short-term cash needs, and we continue to review other ways we can help consumers manage their finances.\nWe also continue to invest to better serve our commercial customers. And early in the second quarter, Tim O'Hara joined the Corporate and Investment Bank from BlackRock as Head of Banking. Tim's expertise and insights will help us maximize our potential and achieve even greater partnership and strategic dialogue with our corporate and institutional clients. And he complements the strong leadership team in our markets and commercial real estate businesses, who have helped us navigate recent market volatility.\nWe believe we have a significant opportunity to serve our existing commercial customers with corporate and investment banking products in a way that works within our existing risk tolerance. We also believe that for us to be successful as a company, we must consider a broad set of stakeholders in our decisions and actions.\nLast week, we announced that Otis Rolley will be joining Wells Fargo from The Rockefeller Foundation as the Head of Social Impact, leading community engagement and enterprise philanthropy, including the Wells Fargo Foundation. We continue to move forward in the area of ESG with the announcement of our 2030 reduction targets for greenhouse gas emissions attributable to financing activities in the oil and gas and power sectors.\nAs homeownership remains out of reach for too many families, we announced an effort to support new home construction, renovation and repair of more than 450 affordable homes across the U.S. in collaboration with Habitat for Humanity and Rebuilding Together. We also launched our special purpose credit program to help minority homeowners refinance mortgages that Wells Fargo currently services.\nWe continue to support our small business customers through this time of uncertainty, including launching the Small Business Resource Navigator, which connects small business owners to potential financing options and technical assistance through community development financial institutions across the country. We are also helping women entrepreneurs by doubling our support for women-owned businesses through the Connect to More program with complementary mentorship opportunities. We published our inaugural diversity, equity and inclusion report, which highlights the meaningful positive results we've made on our DE&I initiatives.\nFor example, in the U.S., our external hiring of individuals from racially or ethnically diverse populations increased by 27% in 2021 compared to 2020, and approximately 1/3 of all internally promoted executives last year were racially or ethnically diverse. As I've said in the past, advancing DE&I at Wells Fargo is a long-term commitment, not a project, and we continue to pursue many of the initiatives in the report and look for ways to deepen our impact.\nLet me just make some summary comments before turning it over to Mike. The Federal Reserve's commitment to an aggressive rate hike cycle as a means to tame high persistent inflation continues to fuel market volatility and is expected to slow the economy, which will impact our consumer and commercial customers.\nDespite the economic environment, I remain optimistic about our future. Credit quality remains strong, and we expect net interest income growth to continue given rising interest rates, which should more than offset any further near-term pressure on noninterest income. We remain on target to achieve a sustainable 10% ROTCE, subject to the same assumptions we've discussed in the past, on a run rate basis in the second half of this year, and then we will discuss our path to 15%. This year's Federal Reserve stress test confirmed our strong capital position and our ability to support our customers and communities while also continuing to return excess capital to shareholders through dividends and common stock repurchases.\nAs we previously announced, we expect to increase our third quarter common stock dividend by 20% to $0.30 per share, subject to approval by the company's Board of Directors at its regularly scheduled meeting later this month.\nI will now turn the call over to Mike.\n\nMichael P. Santomassimo\n\nSenior EVP & CFO, The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation\n\nThanks, Charlie, and good morning, everyone. Net income for the quarter was $3.1 billion or $0.74 per common share, which included strong growth in net interest income as we are beginning to see the positive impact of higher interest rates. Our results included a $576 million impairment of equity securities, predominantly in our venture capital business due to the market conditions, which drove a total loss from equity securities of $615 million in the second quarter. Recall that a year ago, when the markets were strong, our results included $2.7 billion of gains on equity securities.\nWhile credit quality remains strong, our results included a $235 million increase in the allowance for credit losses due to loan growth. This follows 6 consecutive quarterly decreases in the allowance, including $1.1 billion in the first quarter and $1.6 billion a year ago.\nWe highlight capital on Slide 3. Our CET1 ratio was 10.3%, down approximately 20 basis points from the first quarter as declines in AOCI and dividend payments were largely offset by our second quarter earnings. Our CET1 ratio also reflected actions we took to proactively manage our level of capital and risk-weighted assets as well as reduce our AOCI sensitivity by moving more securities to held-to-maturity and hedging securities in our available-for-sale portfolio.\nAdditionally, we did not buy back any shares in the second quarter. But as Charlie highlighted, the recent stress test results confirmed our capacity to return excess capital to shareholders through dividends and common stock repurchases. We will continue to be prudent and consider current market conditions, including interest rate volatility, potential loan and risk-weighted asset growth as well as any potential economic uncertainty with respect to the amount and timing of share repurchases over the coming quarters.\nOur 10.3% CET1 ratio remained well above our required regulatory minimum plus buffers. As a reminder, based on the recent Federal stress test, our stress capital buffer for October 1, 2022 to September 30, 2023 is expected to be 3.2%, which would increase our regulatory minimum plus buffers by 10 basis points to 9.2%.\nTurning to credit quality on Slide 5. Our charge-off ratio remained near historical lows and was only 15 basis points in the second quarter. As we previously discussed, losses are not expected to remain at these low levels. And we are closely monitoring our commercial and consumer customers for signs of stress, and we remain very disciplined in our underwriting. Commercial credit performance remained strong across our commercial businesses with only 2 basis points of net charge-offs in the second quarter, which included net recoveries in our commercial real estate portfolio. We also had net recoveries in our consumer real estate portfolios, and total consumer net charge-offs declined slightly from the first quarter to 33 basis points of average loans, as lower losses in auto and other consumer loans were partially offset by higher credit card losses.\nNonperforming assets decreased $878 million or 13% from the first quarter. Lower levels of consumer nonaccruals were driven by a decline in residential mortgage nonaccrual loans due to sustained payment performance of borrowers after exiting COVID-related accommodation programs.\nCommercial nonaccruals continued to decline, and as Charlie highlighted, we are at their lowest levels in over 10 years. Our allowance for credit losses at the end of the second quarter reflect a continued strong credit performance, with an increase that was due to loan growth.\nOn Slide 6, we highlight loans and deposits. Average loans grew 8% from a year ago and 3% for the first quarter. Period-end loans grew for the fourth consecutive quarter and were up 11% from a year ago, with increases in both our commercial and consumer portfolios.\nI'll highlight the specific growth drivers when discussing operating segment results. Average loan yields increased 19 basis points from a year ago and 27 basis points from the first quarter, reflecting the benefit of higher rates. Average deposits increased $10 billion or 1% from a year ago, with growth in consumer banking and lending, offsetting declines across our other operating segments. The decline in average deposits from the first quarter reflected seasonality of tax payments as well as outflows from commercial and wealth clients.\nOur average deposit cost increased 1 basis point from the first quarter, driven by corporate and investment banking. As I previously highlighted, we would expect deposit betas to accelerate as rates continue to rise and customer migration from lower-yielding to higher-yielding deposit products would likely increase as well.\nTurning to net interest income on Slide 7. Second quarter net interest income increased $1.4 billion or 16% from a year ago and $977 million or 11% from the first quarter. The growth from the first quarter was primarily driven by the impact of higher rates, which increased earning asset yields and reduced premium amortization from mortgage-backed securities. We also benefit from higher loan balances and 1 additional day in the quarter. We started the year expecting full year net interest income to grow by approximately 8% compared with 2021. Last quarter, we raised our guidance to an increase in the mid-teens. With the market now expecting not only more rate hikes but also larger ones, we currently expect net interest income in 2022 to increase approximately 20% from 2021.\nAnd as a reminder, net interest income will ultimately be driven by a variety of factors, including the magnitude and timing of Fed rate increases, deposit betas and loan growth.\nOn Slide 8 in noninterest income. This quarter, noninterest income -- this quarter, we included highlighting noninterest income to show that the decline from both the first quarter and a year ago was primarily driven by 2 cyclical businesses. Mortgage banking, which has slowed in response to higher interest rates, and our affiliated venture capital and private equity businesses, which a year ago generated elevated gains but recognized impairments in the second quarter of this year due to significantly different market conditions.\nWhile all other noninterest income included both positive and negative impacts, it was actually up slightly from the first quarter. The decline in all other noninterest income from a year ago was primarily driven by the impact of last year's divestitures.\nTurning to expenses on Slide 9. Noninterest expense declined 3% from a year ago as expenses related to divestitures came out of the run rate, and we continue to make progress on our efficiency initiatives. Operating losses increased $273 million from a year ago, primarily driven by increased litigation expense, which included a recovery in the second quarter of last year and higher customer remediation expense predominantly from a variety of historical matters.\nCustomer remediation matters are complex and take a significant amount of time to resolve and quantify the full impact. While we've made progress, we have more to do to resolve the remaining items.\nWe're halfway through the year. And while we've had higher operating losses than we expected, revenue-related expenses are trending lower than expected. Our results in the first half of the year also reflected the progress we're making on our efficiency initiatives with lower headcount and reductions in both professional and outside services expense and occupancy expense. We expect to continue to make progress on our efficiency initiatives.\nPutting all these factors together, we still expect our full year 2022 expenses to be approximately $51.5 billion as lower revenue-related expense is expected to offset higher operating losses. But as a reminder, we have outstanding litigation, regulatory matters and customer remediations, and the related expenses could be significant and hard to predict, which could cause us to exceed our $51.5 billion outlook.\nTurning to our operating segments, starting with Consumer Banking and Lending on Slide 10. Consumer and Small Business Banking revenue increased 17% from a year ago, driven by the impact of higher interest rates and higher deposit balances. Our deposit pricing has been stable, but we expect deposit betas to increase over time.\nAs Charlie highlighted, the deposit-related fees were impacted by the overdraft policy changes we started to roll out late in the first quarter, which included the elimination of fees for non-sufficient funds and overdraft protection transactions. Additional changes will be rolled out in the second half of this year, which will further reduce deposit-related fees.\nOn lending revenue declined 53% from a year ago and 35% from the first quarter driven by lower mortgage originations and compressed margins given the higher rate environment and continued competitive pricing in response to excess capacity in the industry. After increasing over 150 basis points in the first quarter, mortgage rates increased over 100 basis points in the second quarter. The impact of higher rates also reduced revenue from the re-securitization of loans purchased from securitization pools. The mortgage market is expected to remain challenging in the near term, and it's possible that we have a further decline in mortgage banking revenue in the third quarter. We are making adjustments to reduce expenses in response to lower origination volumes, and we expect these adjustments will continue over the next couple of quarters. Credit card revenue was up 7%, auto revenue increased 5% and personal lending was up 7% from a year ago, primarily due to higher loan balances.\nTurning to some key business drivers on Slide 11. Our mortgage originations declined 10% from the first quarter, with growth in correspondent partially offsetting the decline in retail originations. Refinances as a percentage of total originations declined to 28%. Average home lending loan balances grew 2% from the first quarter, driven by the fourth consecutive quarter of growth in our nonconforming portfolio, which more than offset declines in loans purchased from securitization pools or EPBOs.\nTurning to auto. Origination volume declined 35% from a year ago and 26% from the first quarter due to increased pricing competition, credit tightening actions and an ongoing industry supply pressures.\nTurning to debit card. While debit card spend increased 3%, transactions were relatively flat from a year ago as increases in travel and entertainment were offset by declines in apparel and home improvement. Credit card point-of-sale purchase volume was up 28% from a year ago with the largest increases in fuel travel and entertainment. The increase in point-of-sale volume and the launch of new products helped drive a 19% in credit card -- 19% increase in credit card balances from a year ago. We remain disciplined in our underwriting and new credit card accounts.\nTurning to Commercial Banking results on Slide 12. Middle Market banking revenue increased 27% from a year ago, driven by higher net interest income from the impact of higher rates and loan balances. Asset-based lending and leasing revenue increased 8% from a year ago, driven by higher loan balances. Noninterest expense increased 2% from a year ago, primarily driven by higher operating costs. Efficiency initiatives drove lower personnel expense with headcount down 9% from a year ago.\nAverage loan balances have grown for 4 consecutive quarters and were up 13% from a year ago. Utilization rates continue to increase, but they are still not back to historical levels. Clients have increased borrowings to rebuild inventory and to support working capital growth, both of which have been impacted by higher inflation. We also had momentum from adding new clients in middle market banking and similar to prior periods, loan growth was driven by the larger clients.\nAverage deposits declined 2% from a year ago driven by actions to manage under the asset cap. Deposit pricing has been relatively stable, but we expect deposit betas will continue to increase.\nTurning to Corporate and Investment Banking on Slide 13. Banking revenue increased 4% from a year ago, primarily driven by stronger treasury management results given the impact of higher interest rates as well as higher loan balances. Investment banking fees declined, reflecting lower market activity and a $107 million write-down on unfunded leveraged finance commitments due to the market spread widening.\nAverage loan balances were up 20% from a year ago, with broad-based loan demand driven by a modest increase in utilization rates due to increased working capital needs given inflationary pressures. Commercial real estate revenues grew 5% from a year ago, driven by loan growth and higher interest rates. Average loan balances were up 22% from a year ago with the disruption in the capital markets increasing demand for bank financing and line utilization.\nMarkets revenue increased 11% from a year ago, primarily due to higher foreign exchange and commodities trading revenue as clients position themselves for rising rates, quantitative tightening and growing recessionary concerns as well as higher equities trading.\nAverage deposits in Corporate and Investment Banking were down 14% from a year ago, driven by continued actions to manage under the asset cap. There's been more deposit pricing pressure in Corporate Banking than we've seen in Commercial Banking.\nOn Slide 14, Wealth and Investment Management revenue grew 5% from a year ago as the increase in net interest income due to the impact of higher rates and higher loan balances more than offset the declines in asset-based fees, driven by lower market valuations as well as lower retail brokerage transaction activity. As a reminder, the majority of WIM advisory assets are priced at the beginning of the quarter, so second quarter results reflected market valuations as of April 1, and third quarter results will reflect the lower market valuations as of July 1. The S&P 500 and fixed income indices declined again in the second quarter, and approximately 2/3 of our advisory assets are in equities. So there will be another step-down in our asset-based fees next quarter.\nAverage loans increased 5% from a year ago, driven by continued momentum in securities-based lending. Average deposits declined 1% from a year ago and were down 7% from the first quarter as clients reallocate cash into higher-yielding alternatives. Deposit pricing increased modestly.\nSlide 15 highlights our Corporate results. Both revenues and expenses declined from a year ago and were impacted by the divestitures of our Corporate Trust Services business and Wells Fargo Asset Management and the sale of our student loan portfolio. These businesses contributed $580 million of revenue in the second quarter of 2021, including the gain on the sale of our student loan portfolio. And they accounted for approximately $375 million of the decline in expenses in the second quarter compared with a year ago, including the goodwill write-down associated with the sale of our student loan portfolio. The decline in revenue in Corporate was also due to lower equity gains in our affiliated venture capital and private equity businesses.\nIn summary, while our net income in the second quarter declined driven by lower venture capital and mortgage banking results, our underlying trends reflected our improving earnings capacity with expenses declining and strong net interest income growth from rising rates and higher loan balances. As we look ahead to the second half of the year, we expect the growth in net interest income to more than offset any further pressure on noninterest income. While we expect credit losses to increase from historically low levels, our consumer and commercial customers are not showing any meaningful signs of stress.\nAs I highlighted earlier, our expense outlook for the year is unchanged at approximately $51.5 billion subject to the risk to the outlook discussed earlier. Finally, our stress test results demonstrated our capacity to return excess capital to shareholders, including the expected 20% increase in our third quarter common stock dividend subject to board approval. We will now take your questions."

Welcome to the Q4 2021 Welltower Inc. Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions)\nPlease be advised that today's conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions)\nI would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today to Mr. Matt McQueen, General Counsel. Please go ahead.\n\nMatthew Grant McQueen\n\nExecutive VP, General Counsel & Corporate Secretary, Welltower Inc.\n\nThank you, and good morning. As a reminder, certain statements made during this call may be deemed forward-looking statements in the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Although Welltower believes any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, the company can give no assurance that its projected results will be attained. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in the company's filings with the SEC. And with that, I'll hand the call over to Shankh.\n\nUnidentified Company Representative\n\nThank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. I'll review the quarter reflect back on 2021 on this year-end call, walk you through high-level business trends and our capital allocation priorities.\nJohn will provide an update on the operational environment for show and MOB portfolios, and Tim will walk you through our triple-net businesses, balance sheet highlights and first quarter guidance. 2021 was a year marked by high conviction capital deployment, partner and talent acquisition and a powerful inflection in our senior housing business.\nOur belief in the long-term demand thesis for the senior housing proved out as we witnessed significant occupancy growth starting in the spring of last year, which continued through the historically seasonally weak winter season. Just as importantly, in the second half of 2021, we began to see a significant shift in the pricing power. Interestingly, we found these pricing power during a period of relatively low occupancy levels.\nAfter all, what industry or asset class do you know of that is able to achieve pricing power with occupancy levels in the low 70% range. Low behold that pricing power continued to strengthen in Q4, and in the first quarter of this year despite the impact of Delta and Omicron.\nSame-store RevPAR grew 3.4% in Q4, falling year-over-year same-store revenue growth of 4.8%, one of the strongest quarter in the company's history. And even more encouraging is the revenue growth in U.S., exceeded 6% with the momentum accelerating through fourth quarter. John will walk you through the details in a moment. Though I am not happy with our (inaudible) bottom line results due to increased expenses mainly from the Omicron induced labor crisis, I continue to believe we will see significant improvement throughout the year given the continued net hiring trends we're seeing from our operating partners. This assumes we don't experience a highly infectious variant. We can offset the higher cost of full-time employees just as we have done during the years prior to COVID, it is a significant presence of contract labor at search pricing level that is a source of the issue.\nFrom a demand standpoint, we saw record interest in our product in Q4 that continued through January with inquiries up significantly from December. However, a meaningful number of tours got canceled or postponed as either the prospective resident or their family got COVID or a community that did not have enough employees to conduct the tour as there was a COVID crisis in the communities.\nHowever, the tours have picked up meaningfully in recent weeks, and we are starting to see strong sales activity, which should translate into higher net move-ins in next 3 to 4 weeks. If we are right about this, you may see occupancy growth exceed seasonal trends while occurring in an environment of strong rate growth. We project this will put us into the double-digit NOI growth range in Q1, only to accelerate further throughout the year. As disappointed as I am about the diminished bottom line flow-through in Q4 due to $30 million of agency costs compared to only $5 million in Q1 of last year I continue to believe that our 2022 exit run rate and 2023 earnings power of this platform is unchanged.\nMoving to capital allocation. In 2021, we deployed $5.7 billion across great real estate with fantastic operator and at even a better price. The most incredible aspect of this story was the granular nature of execution with a median transaction size of $26 million. We're not believers in elephant hunting as larger transactions usually result in value accruing to the seller. As you know, we manage this company for our long-term shareholders to increase our share value. Q4 was no exception to this consistent trend. We have deployed $1.4 billion of capital in Q4 across 20 separate transactions with a median size of $24 million. I won't bore you with the details of every transaction, but I would be remiss not to mention a couple of them, which I'm particularly proud of, including a handful of trophy buildings in Boston and Florida at a very attractive basis. But perhaps the most exciting investment of the quarter was the formation of our partnership with Andy and Plan at Quality Senior Living or QSL.\nIt is hard to overstate how strong of a team Andy and Glenn have built from conceptualization of the product to development execution and ultimately, their operational excellence. For example, despite all the labor challenges that I've highlighted, have used virtually no agency labor and their buildings are well occupied. Andy, who is one of the biggest users of our data analytics platform is embarking on a multiyear effort to expand the Blake brand with the full support of our platform behind him.\nI hope you are seeing a pattern here with how our data and predictive analytics platform attracts some of the best people in the business as we offer so much more than capital. This network effect of platform execution across multiyear partnership that were formed over the last few years will fuel our growth for years to come. As Delta and Omicron induce challenges, we had that ugly head in Q4, capital deployment opportunity set only expanded, and that continued in Q1, which is seasonally the weakest quarter from a deal activity. With -- after a strong close of 2021, we have already closed an approximately $600 million of the investment over the last 6 weeks.\nAnd I'm pleased to report that our pipeline remains robust, highly visible and actionable. While the capital market backdrops remain volatile of late, driven primarily by the Fed headlines. We're well positioned to fund our pipeline with well over $1 billion of equity and availability of liquidity in excess of $4 billion.\nWe're proud of our capital allocation track record both deployment and sourcing. But if capital markets volatility continues, we will access different tools from our toolbox as we have done before. Lastly, I'm very proud to announce our new partnership with Rubin Brothers, which is buying every healthcare, one of our largest operating partner. Rubin Brothers, founded by David and Simon Rubin is one of the largest family offices in the world, and is the owner of prime real estate and infrastructure, both in U.K. and globally. There are also a pioneer of investing in alternative real estate and infrastructure as an early investor and owner of Global Switch. Rubin Brothers share our optimism for the exceptional growth trajectory for health care and wellness infrastructure as society ages. We're particularly excited about the prospect of expanding the platform together as Rubin Brothers owns some of the most prime land and real estate in the U.K. Tim and I have said on this call many times that temporary degradation of cash flow doesn't necessarily mean the extraction of value, every which constitutes 16% of our same-store triple net NOI will be significantly delevered through this equity infusion from Rubin Brothers. Partnering with highly sophisticated global investors like Rubin Brothers, validates our view of the long-term value of this business despite Wall Street's obsession with point-to-time coverage.\nIn conclusion, I'm very proud to of our execution in 2021 across operations, capital allocation and partnership that stay set for multiyear earnings growth as we find ourselves at the bottom of both secular and cyclical cycles with unparalleled platform built with advanced data analytics or so growth vehicles with different partners and talent to execute on it.\nThe pandemic has been devastating for our entire ecosystem, but we have doubled down during this massive disruption given our high conviction investment thesis, you as our shareholders can rest assured that we'll not be resting on our laurels and that will continue to dig deeper and wider moat.\nWith that, I'll pass it over to John. John?\n\nJohn F. Burkart\n\nExecutive VP & COO, Welltower Inc.\n\nThank you, Shankh. My comments today will focus on the performance of our management operating segments in the quarter. Starting with our medical office portfolio. In the fourth quarter, our outpatient medical segment delivered 2.4% same-store NOI growth over the prior year's quarter despite a 20 basis point decline in occupancy.\nWe continue to see strong retention rates at 86% in the fourth quarter and with increasing construction costs and rising market rates, we will continue to push renewal rates in exchange and accept the reasonable level of increased turnover and related frictional vacancy as we maximize the value of the portfolio.\nNow turning to our senior housing operating portfolio. The strong demand-based recovery in the senior housing business continues to strengthen. The show portfolio same-store revenue increased 4.8% in the fourth quarter of 2021, representing the first full period of year-over-year same-store revenue growth since the beginning of the pandemic. Occupancy grew 90 basis points over the prior year's quarter. Again, the first year-over-year increase in occupancy since the beginning of the pandemic and the largest year-over-year gain for any quarter since 2016. Sequentially, the show portfolio spot occupancy increased approximately 70 basis points during the fourth quarter to 77.7%. Compounding these strong occupancy trends is a notable shift in pricing power.\nOver the second half of the year, operators have successfully raised and are again able to charge community raised rates and are, again, able to charge community fees, both of which were reflected in a 3.4% year-over-year increase in RevPAR during the quarter.\nAnd following an outsized increases on January and February renewals with little to no pushback, we expect further acceleration in RevPAR growth over the course of the year. Geographically, each of our markets Canada, the U.K. and the U.S. are showing improvement in same-store top line metrics through the quarter. Our Canadian portfolio, which has lagged the recovery posted a year-over-year revenue decline of 3% in Q4 2021.\nHowever, the revenue decline improved intra-quarter moving from a decline of 4.2% in October 2021 to a decline of 1.4% in December '21 compared to the prior year's respective months. Sequentially, the Canadian same-store portfolio grew at a revenue rate of 1.8% in the fourth quarter. In the U.K., our same-store revenue increased 7.8% during the fourth quarter on a year-over-year basis, accelerating from 7.1% growth in October of 2021 to 9% in December of 2021 compared to the prior year's respective months.\nFinally, in the U.S., where the majority of our portfolio is located, year-over-year revenue growth in the fourth quarter was 6.3%. The acceleration in revenue growth was particularly pronounced in the U.S., accelerating from 3.8% in October 21 versus the prior year's month to 9.1% in December. Despite these encouraging top line trends, expenses increased 8.8% year-over-year, driven largely by excessive agency cost. The combination of holiday time off and Omicron disruption led to an increase in agency costs in the quarter, almost 4.5x agency expense versus the prior year's quarter.\nExcluding agency costs, expenses increased 5.3%. Stress and Systems highlights opportunities and issues and the extreme stress in the health care system brought on by COVID has identified some opportunities to improve the value proposition for our hard-working health care workers. The agencies have been a temporary crush, which will provide a short-term option for both operators and the health care workers. That said, the excessive use of agencies is truly short term in nature and the exceptional premiums that they charge as much as 6x the base rate during the recent holiday period do not pass through to the agency employees who typically do not receive benefits either. The quality of life and their work experience is substantially less desirable than that of a permanent employee. Agency employees lack the connection to their coworkers and customers that they desire as they travel from site to site, city to city and state to state on a daily basis often away from their families.\nAdditionally, agency employees are less efficient as they do not know the systems nor the processes of the operator or the site nor the specific customer requirement. Our operators have many workflows underway at this time to improve the value proposition for permanent employees, which were bearing fruit prior to the Omicron. Nonetheless, the results of these outsized expenses was a decline in same-store NOI of 9.3% in the fourth quarter of 2021, but still marked an improvement from Q3 2021, with over 50% of operators delivering positive NOI growth for the period.\nThe recovery continues to strengthen despite recent Omicron disruption, and we remain confident in our ability to drive significant NOI growth in 2022. Through January, agency labor expense has declined as staff cases have fallen. Labor expense is expected to moderate further through the first half of 2022 and declined substantially in the second half of 2022. The other disruption caused by Omicron was a record cancellation of tourists, which Sean described. However, at this point, weekly staff cases are down 81% from their peak, including an 89% drop in the U.S., and we are seeing operations normalize.\nThe disruption of tours and sales caused occupancy to fall about 20 basis points in January. However, with the high level of traffic, we expect that the continued occupancy gains will return and that we will regain lost occupancy by the end of the quarter. Here are some quotes from our operators about the strength of traffic and deposits. digital inquiries were up 36% over 2019 in the fourth quarter and continued strong in January. Our 4-week averages for inquiries, tours and deposits are the highest they've been since August of 2021, we are seeing week-over-week growth in deposits of 10% the last 4 weeks running. We are experiencing the strongest January for inquiries in several years. And finally our inquiries from the last week alone have been the highest numbers we've ever experienced. In closing, I have shifted from full immersion in the business to planning in action. I'm even more excited about the future opportunities across the Welltower platform. We are leveraging our proprietary data analytics platform and operationalizing the data to drive results. This process is occurring right now as we have several workflows underway, which we expect to bear fruit in the immediate future as well as many more workflows that we expect to drive our outperformance in the quarters and years to come.\nI continue to be appreciative of the warm welcome and excitement expressed by our operators as we leverage our combined real estate operating company and care experience to improve the customer and employee experience and drive financial results. Each operator has a unique expertise and opportunities. We have been working very well together and offering support where needed from implementing best practices to applying data analytics to improve their business. In one case, we identified a software tool over 25 years old. As they say, the '90s called and they want their deeper back. I'm confident there is a substantial opportunity to implement operational excellence across the board and bringing the basic back office and sales operations up to match the high quality of care the operators are delivering which will drive significant margin growth in the years to come.\nI'll now turn the call over to Tim.\n\nTimothy G. McHugh\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Welltower Inc.\n\nThank you, John. My comments today will focus on our fourth quarter 2021 results. Performance of our triple net investment segment in the quarter are capital activity, a balance sheet and liquidity update, and finally, our outlook for the first quarter. Welltower reported fourth quarter net income attributable to common stockholders of a $0.13 per diluted share and normalized funds from operations of $0.83 per diluted share relative to the guidance of $0.78 to $0.83 per share. Our results included approximately $18 million or $0.04 per diluted share of HHS funds and other out-of-period government grants that were not previously budgeted.\nTurning to our triple net lease portfolios. As a reminder, our triple-net lease portfolio coverage and occupancy stats reported a quarter in arrears. So these statistics reflect the trailing 12 months at 9/30/2021. In our senior housing triple-net portfolio, same-store NOI increased 4.2% year-over-year, driven by improvements in rent collections on leases currently on cash recognition and the early impact of rental increases tied to CPI.\nWe expect the impact of both these trends to accelerate in 2022. As rent collections improve, given that 20% of our leases are subject to API-based escalators. Trailing 12-month EBITDA coverage was 0.8x. Looking forward, we expect coverages to inflect positively in the first half of 2022 as year-over-year improvement in fundamentals followed the positive trends expected in our senior housing operating portfolio. Next, our long-term post-acute portfolio generated negative 0.8% year-over-year same-store NOI growth. However, similar to our senior housing triple net portfolio, we expect NOI growth to improve in 2022 through greater rent collections on leases currently in cash recognition as well as CPI-based rent escalators.\nTrailing 12-month EBITDAR coverage was 1.29x. Over the course of 2021, we completed $458 million of long-term post-acute dispositions at a blended cap rate of 8.7%. With an additional $108 million under contract for sale at year-end. As a result, our long-term post-acute portfolio represented just 5.2% of total in-place NOI at year-end versus 10.1% at the end of 2020. A 490 basis point decline driven largely by the exit of our Genesis relationship. And lastly, health systems, which is comprised of our ProMedica Senior Care joint venture with ProMedica Health System, had same-store NOI growth of positive 2.75% year-over-year and trailing 12-month EBITDA coverage was 0.39x. The sequential improvement in coverage was driven by the previously announced agreement to sell 25 assets that have been contributing negative EBITDA.\nAs of year-end, we completed the sale of '21 of those assets with the remaining 4 held for sale. Turning to capital market activity. We continue to enhance our balance sheet strength and position the company to capitalize our robust and highly visible pipeline of capital deployment opportunities by utilizing our ATM program to fund those near-term transactions.\nSince the beginning of the fourth quarter, we've sold 11.3 million shares via forward sale agreements at an initial weighted average price, $85.06 per share for expected gross proceeds of $961 million. We currently have approximately 11.1 million shares remaining unsettled, which are expected to generate future proceeds of $949 million. This is in addition to $220 million of expected property disposition and loan payoff proceeds.\nDuring the quarter, we also issued $500 million of 10-year unsecured debt maturing in 2032 with a coupon of 2.75%. Following similar discipline in their equity funding strategy, this is our third unsecured issuance in 2021, bringing full year issuance to $1.75 billion, with an average ratio of 9.5 years and a coupon of 2.6%. At year-end, when factoring in cash and restricted cash balances, our liquidity position exceeded the $4 billion of borrowing capacity on our line of credit. When combined with the previously mentioned $1.2 billion of combined unsettled ATM proceeds and expected disposition proceeds, we are in a very strong liquidity position heading into 2022. We ended the fourth quarter with 6.95x net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA, down slightly from last quarter. Leverage is impacted by the timing of $1.5 billion of net investment activity completed later in the quarter. If we run rate the impact of net investment activity completed in the quarter, pro forma net debt to adjusted EBITDA decreased to 6.75x. We continue to be pleased with the momentum of our top line recovery in our senior housing operating portfolio. with portfolio spot occupancy ending the quarter at 77.7%, 70 basis points higher than the end of the prior quarter, but still 950 basis points below pre-COVID levels. The portfolio also sits 1,300 basis points below peak occupancy levels. Setting the stage for a powerful EBITDA recovery as occupancy upside and strong rate growth is coupled with significant margin expansion of a very depressed base.\nLastly, moving to our first quarter outlook. Last night, we provided an outlook for the first quarter of net income attributable to common stockholders per diluted share of $0.17 to $0.22 per share, and normalized FFO per diluted share of $0.79 to $0.84 or $0.815 at the midpoint.\nThis guidance takes into consideration approximately $6 million or $0.015 per share of HHS funds expected to be received in the first quarter. Excluding the HHS funds, the $0.80 per share midpoint of our first quarter guidance, represents a $0.01 sequential increase from an as adjusted $0.785 per share number for 4Q, which excludes $18 million of previously recognized HHS and out-of-period U.K. and Canadian subsidies recognized in the quarter.\nThis $0.015 increase is composed of $0.025 from a sequential increase in senior housing operating portfolio NOI and fourth quarter investment activity and an offset of $0.01 increase of sequential G&A and income taxes. Underlying this FFO guidance is estimated first quarter total portfolio year-over-year same-store growth of 7%, driven by subsegment growth of outpatient medical, 1% to 2% growth; long-term post-acute, 1% to 2%; health systems, 2.75%; Senior housing triple net, 5% to 6%; and finally, senior housing offering growth of approximately 15%, driven by revenue growth of 10%.\nUnderlying this revenue growth is an expectation of approximately 420 basis points of year-over-year average occupancy increase. And with that, I will hand the call back over to Shankh.\n\nShankh S. Mitra\n\nCEO, CIO & Director, Welltower Inc.\n\nThanks, Tim. I wanted to conclude this call by addressing something that we usually don't talk about, and that is our comprehensive team. We have completed a completely overhauled and upgraded our team, and this was a multiyear effort building out new areas such as breaktime analytics to create a truly scalable platform. with extremely low volunteer turnover, we continue to hire the best and the brightest to fight that deepen our capital allocation expertise. Historically, the majority of the alpha we created have been through astute raising or deployment of capital. Over the last 15 months, though, we have also built out an industry-leading and frankly, a very significant development team under the leadership of Mike Fey and (inaudible) The last piece of this puzzle is building out our operational excellence and asset management capabilities. This started with the hiring of John in 2021. John is building out a world-class team that will accelerate value creation for our shareholders for years to come. We have added a net 51 people last year and we're likely to add another 80 new colleagues in 2022. Many of you who follow our company closely understand that our asset platform is like a coil spring today. We spent heavily during the pandemic, but most of these assets are sitting with low occupancy and thus, cash flow which is about to be released and search forward to realize its full value. Similarly, the people side of our business platform is also a call spring today. You are only seeing them in G&A line, but their full contribution to the revenue line will be seen in 2023 and beyond.\nWith that, operator, please open up the call for questions."

Q1 2023 Earnings Call\n\nWELLTORONTOMAY 12, 7:00 PM\n\nOperator\n\nWelcome to the WELL Health Technologies Corp. First Quarter 2023 Financial Results Conference Call. My name is Laura, and I'll be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this conference is being recorded. I'll now turn the call over to Tyler Baba, Manager, Investor Relations. Mr. Baba, you may begin.\n\nUnknown Executive\n\nThank you, operator, and welcome, everyone, to WELL Health's Fiscal First Quarter Financial Results Conference Call. for the 3 months ended March 31, 2023. Joining me on the call today are Hamed Shahbazi, Chairman and CEO; and Eva Fong, the company's CFO. I trust that everyone has received a copy of our financial results press release that was issued earlier today.\nPortions of today's call, other than historical performance, include statements of forward-looking information within the meaning of applicable securities law, including future-oriented financial information and financial outlook information. Forward-looking statements are necessarily based upon a number of estimates and assumptions that, while considered reasonable by management, are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies. These forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors, many of which are outside of WELL control that may cause the actual results, performance or achievements as well to differ materially from the anticipated results, performance or achievements implied by such forward-looking statements.\nThese factors are further outlined in today's press release and in our management discussion and analysis. We provide forward-looking statements solely for the purpose of providing information about management's current expectations and plans relating to the future. We do not undertake or accept any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements to reflect any change in our expectations or any change in events, conditions, assumptions or circumstances on which any such statement is based, except if it is required by law.\nWe may use terms such as adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross margin, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted shareholder EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted free cash flow on this conference call, all of which are non-GAAP and non-IFRS measures. For more information on how we define these terms, please refer to the definition set out in today's press release and in our management discussion and analysis. The company believes that adjusted EBITDA is a meaningful financial metric as it measures cash generated from operations, which the company can use to fund working capital requirements, service future interest and principal debt repayments and fund future growth initiatives. Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an alternative to net income or loss determined in accordance with IFRS.\nAnd with that, let me turn the call over to Mr. Hamed Shahbazi, Chairman and CEO.\n\nHamed Shahbazi\n\nFounder, Chairman & CEO\n\nThank you, Tyler, and good day, everyone. We hope you're all keeping safe and healthy, and we appreciate you for joining us today. Overall, we're very pleased with our record-breaking quarter in which we achieved record revenue and growth across all key metrics. WELL achieved revenue of $169.5 million in the first quarter, representing 34% year-over-year revenue growth. The first quarter of 2023 also marks our 17th consecutive quarter of record revenue. The company's growth was driven by acquisitions made over the past year as well as solid year-over-year organic growth of 21% in the first quarter. So most of our 34% year-over-year growth came from organic growth.\nI'm proud to report that WELL has healthy cash flows having achieved almost $26.7 million in adjusted EBITDA in Q1 2023, resulting in adjusted free cash flow available to shareholders of approximately $10.8 million. Our record revenue, profitability and patient visits are a testament to the company's continued focus on tech-enabling health care providers and supporting them in terms of simplifying their work lives, modernizing and digitizing their practices and delivering the best health care possible. We're extremely passionate about supporting our providers as we set up our business in a way that we only succeed if they do. This attitude and focus is what allows the company to continue to witness healthy growth across all its business segments, including both online and in person care channels, with minimal impacts due to recession, inflation, supply chain or other macroeconomic effects.\nLast quarter, we discussed a number of new catalysts that we felt were going to act as key tailwinds for WELL. We'd like to reiterate and update them as follows: one, the emergence of artificial intelligence, including generative AI to power revolutionary tools that can dramatically improve the productivity of the health care provider. We will spend a considerable amount of time on -- later on today's call discussing our AI strategy and key progress updates. Two, the increased likelihood of more public and private partnerships announced by political and public health leaders most recently in Ontario earlier this year. Three, a commitment by federal authorities in Canada to add significant additional funding to help Canada, not only improve sustainability of its health care system, but to also digitize and modernize it. Four, the demonstration, particularly in the United States of how valuable hybrid care networks are based on a string of highly visible multibillion-dollar acquisitions, where major companies such as Amazon and large pharmacy chains have been acquiring providers of scaled hybrid health care providers, particularly in primary care with strong physical and telehealth offerings. To that end, WELL has considerably grown its physical infrastructure in the U.S., ending the quarter with 23 physical facilities from 5 at the end of December 2023 -- 2022, pardon me. Five, our own M&A pipeline is very strong, and we are seeing some of the best opportunities we have seen in a while. We'll give this topic some due focus today.\nBefore I hand the call over to Eva to review the first quarter financial results, I'd like to provide some additional background on WELL and our growing patient volume metrics.\nOver the past 5 years, we have grown both organically and inorganically into 1 of the leading digital health care companies in North America. In Q1 2023, WELL achieved record patient interactions of approximately 1.4 million patient interactions, an increase of 27%, representing 5.6 million patient interactions on an annualized run rate basis. In Q1 2023, WELL achieved 975,500 total omnichannel patient visits, including both Canadian and U.S. patient visits, an increase of 25% compared to the prior year. The growth of our patient visit metrics demonstrate the company's continued leadership position as the preeminent end-to-end health care company in Canada with increasing market share in the United States. I'm also pleased to announce that WELL has now surpassed over 3,000 practitioners who deliver patient care from 1 of WELL's owned clinics or business units.\nWe offer these practitioners a fully managed service, where the practitioners can focus on delivering care while WELL takes care of everything else. Furthermore, there are now over 28,000 unique practitioners who rely on WELL in some way to power their medical practices. That equates to more than 1 out of every 4 health care providers in Canada who uses 1 of WELL's technology solutions. These practitioners can pick tools and solutions on an a la carte basis, such as practice management, telehealth, revenue cycle management or patient engagement tools such as online patient booking or e-referrals. If you haven't had a chance to look at our Q1 2023 MD&A, or management discussion and analysis report posted to SEDAR this morning, I urge you to take a look. Inside, you'll find that we provided some enhanced segmentation, which now breaks down the business between our fully managed patient services and SaaS and technology services businesses. You'll find a lot of new detailed metrics across both U.S. and Canadian businesses as well as detailed KPIs on our SaaS and services businesses.\nWe'd like to continue to shine a light on all the different levers of the business to help investors and analysts better understand WELL and how we're delivering on our mission of tech-enabling providers. Let's look at this new lens on segmentation and how it reflects our business. First, we've got our Patient Services business. This segment includes WELL's owned and operated network of clinics, which is Canada's largest network of clinics consisting of 139 clinics operating out of 77 physical facilities. WELL's strongly believes in the benefits of an integrated health offering and bringing together a diverse multidisciplinary offering of providers in the same setting. As such, many of these physical facilities have multiple clinics operating within the same location. Keep in mind that the total number of clinics across both the U.S. and Canada is north of 160 clinics operated out of 100 physical facilities, not including any ASCs, or ambulatory surgery centers, served by CRH Medical.\nOur Canadian Patient Services business includes primary care, Allied Health, Executive Health, and diagnostic clinics delivered through in-person and telehealth means, which, combined, generating almost 504,000 patient visits in Q1 alone, a 14% increase over Q1 2022.\nSecondly, in terms of segments, our Patient Services business in the United States. This group includes omnichannel health care services and solutions WELL provide in the United States targeting specialized markets such as the gastrointestinal market, women's health, primary care and mental disorders under the CRH, Circle Medical and Wisp business units. Our U.S. patient services business generated almost 472,000 patient visits in the first quarter an increase of 40% as compared to the same quarter last year, driven mostly by the organic growth at Circle and Wisp, in addition to the acquisition growth at CRH. Under the CRH brand, we are the leading provider of sedation services for colonoscopies in the U.S. in an ambulatory setting. In the U.S., WELL continues to expand its clinical presence with anesthesia services now being offered in 128 ASCs and GI clinics across 18 states. Headquartered in San Francisco, California, Circle Medical is a leading provider of telehealth based primary care, with an emphasis on mental health services, with a growing physical clinic network.\nAnd then also part of this segment is, of course, Wisp, 1 of the largest and fastest-growing specialty telehealth businesses focusing uniquely on women's reproductive and sexual health. And then the third segment that you'll see is our SaaS and Technology Services segment. This group includes all of our best-in-class platform tools and services that help providers digitize, modernize and support their clinical operations, inclusive of EMR, billing, revenue cycle management, digital apps, including OceanMD and of course, cybersecurity and data protection divisions, which essentially form the entire practitioner enablement platform.\nKeep in mind that WELL is a unique company with both patient services and technology. We own significant intellectual property which drive our industry-leading solutions and has created compelling and relevant links with health care providers all over the country. What is really interesting about the link between our SaaS and Patient Services segment is that WELL is the largest customer of our own platform. How is that for authenticity, a company that uses its own software at scale and demonstrate that it works every day.\nAdditional key metrics for this business unit include the fact that now the WELL EMR Group serves 3,900 clinics in Canada. OceanMD reported 190,000 e-referrals just in Q1. Our billing and revenue cycle management business has expanded to serving over 5,700 health care practitioners. And our apps.health now has 54 digital applications or apps on its platform, making it the largest health care-focused app marketplace in Canada.\nWith that, I'd now like to turn the call over to our CFO, Eva Fong Fong, who will review the financials for fiscal quarter 2023. I will then come back and provide further commentary on our business units and, of course, our outlook. Eva?\n\nEva Fong\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, Hamed. I'm pleased to report that we had very strong results for the 3 months ended March 31, 2023. Our overall first quarter results were as follows. WELL achieved record quarterly revenue of $169.4 million in Q1 2023, an increase of 34% as compared to revenue of $126.5 million generated during Q1 of last year. This growth was driven by acquisitions and organic growth. WELL achieved record adjusted gross profit of $86.2 million in Q1 2023, an increase of 24% as compared to adjusted gross profit of $69.4 million in Q1 last year.\nGrowth in the company's adjusted gross profit is attributable to higher revenue in the period.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $26.7 million in Q1 2023, an increase of 14% as compared to adjusted EBITDA of $23.5 million in Q1 of last year. Adjusted EBITDA attributable to WELL's shareholders was $20.6 million in Q1 2023, an increase of 28% as compared to adjusted EBITDA attributable to WELL's shareholders of $16.1 million in Q1 2022.\nAdjusted net income was $14.1 million or $0.06 per share in Q1 2023, an increase of 58% as compared to adjusted net income of $8.9 million or $0.04 per share in the same period last year. WELL generated 12% of its revenues from truly recurring and subscription revenues and 83% of its revenue from its highly recurring patient services revenues. That means that approximately 95% of its revenues are highly predictable.\nI will now review our segment results, as described by Hamed earlier. Our Canadian patient services business achieved another record quarter with revenue of $50.9 million in Q1 2023, an increase of 23% as compared to $41.3 million in Q1 2022. Canadian Patient Services revenue includes revenue generated from our primary care and MyHealth. divisions. Primary Care revenues increased 45% to $24.8 million in Q1 2023 compared to $17.1 million in Q1 2022, primarily due to organic growth and the addition of new clinics. Primary Care revenue also benefited from a onetime stabilization payment from the BC government of approximately $0.5 million in the first quarter as well as higher billings from the new payment model for BC doctors that was implemented in February earlier this year.\nIn Q1 2023, MyHealth revenue increased 8% to $26.1 million as compared to $24.2 million in Q1 2020. The growth in MyHealth revenue is attributable to continued effort to alleviate staff shortages experienced last year leading to higher billable time for many of its diagnostic procedures. MyHealth also benefited in the quarter from the addition of new cardiologists to its practice.\nOur U.S. patient services revenue was $99.2 million in Q1 2023, an increase of 38% as compared to $72.1 million in Q1 2022. U.S. patient services includes our CRH, Circle Medical and Wisp businesses. For Q1 2023, CRH revenues were $57.5 million, an increase of 19% as compared to $48.2 million in Q1 last year. CRH case volumes also continue to be very strong, with 132,580 anesthesia cases completed in Q1 2023, an increase of 13% compared to Q1 last year.\nCase volumes in the first quarter were positively impacted by the acquisition of affiliated Tempa Anesthesia Associates in the quarter.\nGiven the nature of how health plans and their deductibles work through the year for elective procedures, such as colonoscopies, fourth quarter is usually CRH's strongest seasonal quarter. And normally, we would expect CRH's Q1 revenue to decline from Q4. However, this quarter, we witnessed an increase of 10% in CRH's revenue from Q4 2022 to Q1 2023, which was largely due to a onetime promotional campaign for its O'Regan product, resulting in a record 59,620 O'Regan negator units being sold in the first quarter, an increase of 41% and as compared to 42,280 negator units sold in Q1 2022, and an increase of [ 39% ] compared to 42,750 negator units sold in Q4 of last year. The O'Regan product promotional campaign has now ended and negate unit volumes have returned to normal levels.\nCircle Medical revenues were $23.1 million in Q1 2023, an increase of 93% as compared to revenue of $12 million in Q1 of last year. Wisp achieved revenue of $18.6 million in Q1 2023, an increase of 56% as compared to revenue of $11.9 million in Q1 2022. Both Circle Medical and Wisp have achieved tremendous revenue growth over the past year, which has been entirely organic in nature. Of note, we increased our ad spending in Q1 2023 for Wisp to take advantage of much lower ad rate in the first 3 months of the year as compared to the last 3 months of the year. Although this did have a softening effect of our overall adjusted EBITDA in the quarter, I'm pleased to report that Wisp still managed to achieve positive adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter.\nSaaS and Technology Services revenues were $19.3 million in Q1 2023, an increase of 47%, as compared to $13.1 million in Q1 2022. The vast majority of this growth came organically, which was 42% growth year-over-year. Also in Q1, SaaS and Technology Services revenue growth was driven by exceptional growth in the cybersecurity and data protections business, which achieved its best quarter ever. Cyber security and data protection revenue tends to be lumpy, and we are not expecting this growth to continue into Q2 2023.\nWELL ended Q1 2023 with a solid balance sheet. As at March 31, 2023, WELL had cash and cash equivalents of CAD 41.7 million. While continues to be in good standing and fully compliant with all covenants related with its 2 credit lines, JPMorgan in the U.S. and World Bank in Canada. The debt from the 2 credit lines was approximately CAD 253.4 million as of March 31, 2023.\nI'm also very pleased to report that we have reduced WELL's leverage ratio to 2.6x as at the end of Q1 2023 compared to 3.5x as at Q1 of last year. We define leverage ratio as total debt excluding convertible debentures, less cash on hand, divided by shareholder adjusted EBITDA. The improvement in WELL's leverage ratio was achieved by a decrease in the company's debt levels and an increase in shareholder adjusted EBITDA.\nIn terms of our share capitalization, as of May 11, 2023, WELL had 253,787,569 fully diluted securities issued and outstanding.\nThat is my financial update, and I turn the call back over to Hamed.\n\nHamed Shahbazi\n\nFounder, Chairman & CEO\n\nThank you, Eva. Before I speak to our outlook, I'd like to take a few minutes to talk about the development use and proliferation of artificial intelligence or AI-based technologies and solutions at WELL. I'm pleased to report that as a company with deep tech experience and capabilities, we have made AI a key priority within the company and are working on compelling new products and enhancements to roll out to our provider network. At WELL, we have developed a 3-pronged I strategy as follows: first prong is to develop and deploy new physician tools and technologies that better support our providers. Earlier this week, the company launched WELL AI voice, transformational ambient scribe product that leverages generative AI to dramatically reduce the providers' administrative burden by privately and securely capturing a patient encounter conversation and automatically generating a succinct and medically relevant chart notes for the patient interaction. What makes WELL AI voice so powerful is not only its ability to leverage generative AI, but also its ability to communicate seamlessly with WELL's EMR products, making it easy for providers to deploy, manage and benefit from the technology quickly and easily without having to harmonize the usage of [indiscernible] tools.\nOur focus is on provider-facing technologies in AI and thirdly, derisking and creating barrels for this sort of technology for health care providers. We believe that AI technologies can be used safely and securely to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of health care providers and to deliver better patient outcomes.\nThe second prong for us is to establish centers of excellence at WELL to help our employees become better users of AI. Long term, this may end up being the most important facet of AI for us. We have placed high priority on the safe and secure usage of AI technologies as well and are well on our way to embrace the technology to increase the core productivity of the company. We are thoughtfully considering different ways of putting the technology to work, including hosting internal hackathon sessions to help us coalesce around best ideas. We're also in the process of hiring AI facilitators to help ensure that our teams are driving maximum benefit from AI.\nThird prong is to place more bets or investments on AI and health care-focused companies. As part of our commitment to developing AI technologies, WELL recently announced that it was launching the WELL AI investment platform in our WELL Ventures group. whose goal it is to invest in at least 10 companies this year with a minimum investment of $250,000 and to ensure that each investee has a strategic alliance agreement with WELL that allows it to benefit from WELL's health care ecosystem. Since launching this program, we have already seen more than 100 companies come inbound into our channels.\nIn addition, our apps.health platform is a very attractive aspect of the AI investment program as it provides a framework for AI-based technology companies to integrate with our Oscar EMR as well as other EMRs and health care-related applications. We already have several AI-focused applications in our apps.health platform.\nLastly, for AI, we're also investigating opportunities to unlock the value of our own data to help further propel our providers and help them not only create more efficiency and productivity in their practices, but also importantly, better -- drive better patient outcomes. We believe that our data can help create new decision support systems in the future.\nThis is actually a good segue to WELL's ESG program. As you may be aware, WELL has a fulsome ESG program that is expressed at its dedicated ESG website at esg.well.company. There are effectively 3 key pillars to this program: One, our practitioner support and digital enablement, which, of course, is our mission and mandate. The second is the safeguarding of patient data. And the third is to be a very healthy place to work. We believe AI will profoundly impact and strengthen WELL's ESG program at all levels, but I'd like to zoom into pillar #2 for a minute and discuss how we believe WELL can add societal value using its ESG program and commitments.\nYou see we believe that WELL's commitment to champion the cause of privacy, safety and security of patient data now needs to be achieved within the context of allowing patients to knowingly, in a clear and unambiguous manner, be able to have their data work for them and help them create personal insights for them that can help them acquire life-changing insights, but also support the greater good by allowing their data to be shared, again, knowingly for neural networks that are powering deep learning. This is a very important, but highly fundamental shift. Data security is not good enough. It does not allow me as a consumer or as a patient to derive benefit from my data, especially as we shift into a world where we finally have the technology that allows machines to learn, find that needle in the haystack problem and provide outstanding insights.\nAnd now I'd like to speak a bit about our outlook for 2023. We're pleased to report that all of our business units are executing very well, and we are expecting to have very strong performance in 2023 across all of our BUs and for the entire company as a whole. The company doesn't foresee any material influences or challenges that would impair its ability to deliver solid results in 2023 as we're poised to invest in, achieve significant growth while delivering on enhanced profitability. As such, management is pleased to provide the following guidance for 2023.\nWe are increasing our guidance for annual revenues to between $690 million and $710 million, representing 21% to 25% annual growth. This is an increase from our prior guidance of annual revenue, which was between $665 million and $685 million. We're also pleased to reiterate our guidance for annual adjusted EBITDA to increase by more than 10% over 2022 levels. Our guidance does not include any unannounced acquisitions. Previously, we've indicated that between our organic growth and steady acquisition program, we believe we have a clear line of sight to $1 billion in revenues in 3 years. Today, we'd like to report that we are now seeing 1 of the most compelling pipelines of acquisitions we've ever seen. This doesn't mean we're going to rush out and execute on all of them as we're going to continue to be extremely disciplined in terms of our due diligence and our capital allocation processes. However, it does mean that if we are able to execute on some of these opportunities, we could potentially reach $1 billion in sales in less than a time in 3 years. Again, this is highly conditioned on our ability to execute on some of these opportunities, but highly encouraging to know that this potential exists, especially given the health of our balance sheet. Stay tuned on this as your team here at WELL executes.\nI will now provide some additional outlook for our business segments. First, our Canadian patient services business, including primary care and MyHealth. And it's become a lot more difficult for doctors to run their own clinical businesses. We talked about this in the past due to the increasing complexity brought about by hybrid and complex workflows, IT security and other challenges, making it very difficult for the physicians to run even small practices. For this reason, we are seeing more physicians seek WELL out as a professional partner to help them run their businesses so they can focus on providing patient care. Our model allows for health care providers to maintain similar pre unit economics, but end up seeing a lot more patients if they don't have to run a practice, which allows them to elevate care, improve earnings and better support the health care ecosystem.\nGrowth in our Patient Services business in 2023 will be driven by continuing to focus on organic growth and executing on a highly disciplined clinic acquisition program. Our organic growth includes recruiting more physicians and recruiting or absorbing clinics themselves. In addition, we have a very active pipeline of clinic acquisition opportunities ranging from single clinics to small networks.\nI'd like to now comment on our MyHealth business in Ontario. WELL's Ontario-based MyHealth Partners is the largest single mentions holder and service provider for specialty clinics providing diagnostics in the province of Ontario, and we believe it is very well positioned to support the Ontario government's mandate particularly in the areas of diagnostic imaging. Last quarter, we discussed the Ontario government's new multipronged strategy to reduce wait times by partnering with independent service providers for Ontarians, including areas associated with MRI, CT, colonoscopy and endoscopy services. We intend to apply for new MRI and CT licenses, which will be provided by the province of Ontario under the SE program.\nWe anticipate that new licenses will be awarded in the second half of 2023. If MyHealth is successful in its application, we would need to incur additional capital costs to purchase imaging equipment and for leasehold improvements. We anticipate lead times of several months to having these services fully operational in clinics. As such, we don't expect a meaningful contribution in 2023 if we were to win these licenses.\nOur outlook for Q2 remains positive as we're expecting MyHealth to report a strong quarter as the second quarter is seasonally the strongest for MyHealth historically. Almost all of MyHealth's revenue arises from referrals from physicians, and as such, as they are more working days in Q2 compared to the slower summer months, or the December flooding season, MyHealth therefore, experienced more patient volumes in the second quarter.\nAnd now some commentary on U.S. patient services businesses, including CRH Circle and Wisp. For the CRH business, we expect CRH case volumes to follow normal seasonal patterns in 2023, with the number of cases increasing in each subsequent quarter as we expect Q4 2023 will again be the strongest revenue quarter for CRH. It should be noted that between Q1 and Q2 2022, CRH received more than $2 million in U.S. in pandemic-related government assistance. This grant helped offset labor costs and thus improved EBITDA in Q1 and Q2 last year, which will not be repeated in Q2 2023. Also, as you previously mentioned, CRH revenue in Q1 was boosted by a onetime promotion on Oregon product sales. We're not looking to repeat this product promotion in Q2. Hence, we do expect Origin product sales to decline in the second quarter, which should not materially impact overall results. For our circa Medical business, Q1 will be a transformative quarter in which circle built out its physical clinical network already a leader in providing telehealth services for primary mental health. I'm pleased to report that Circle Medical aggressively grew its physical clinic network to 18 clinics across the United States as of the end of Q1 2023 compared to only 2 clinics at the end of December. The expansion of Circle Medical's physical clinic network will improve its hybrid care capabilities and strengthen its ability to better support its patients. The new clinics strategically located in cities across the United States offer a range of medical services, including primary care and specialty care. The clinics are equipped with state-of-the-art technology staffed by highly qualified health care professionals and designed to provide a seamless health care experience for Circle Medical's excellent telemedicine platform. The clinic expansion of our Circle Medical network positions the company well for the public health emergency in the United States. Going forward, our plan is to follow a slower and more measured patient expanding circle physical clinical network as compared to the aggressive pace that we've witnessed, we expect the expansion of Circle Medical's physical footprint and related investments to create some softness around their results in Q2, but we believe this will further fuel their growth in the back half of the year and have considered this as part of our overall guidance.\nOur Wisp business is expected to continue to experience healthy revenue growth in 2023. However, we are purposely reinvesting any cash flows generated by this business back into growth. The additional spending is primarily on marketing costs, taking new patients and drive additional revenues. As a result of this reinvestment, we are expecting minimal adjusted EBITDA contribution from Wisp in the first half of the year, which is also retooling some of its key product and distribution partners in Q2. So while we expect revenues to be strong over the full year, we will have lower growth temporarily next quarter in Q2 2023.\nFinally, SaaS and Technology Services. The outlook looks promising for our SaaS and tech services group. And as Eva noted earlier, this group had incredible growth in Q1 with 42% organic growth. Also for the first time in a while, SaaS and services comprised more than 10% of WELL's overall revenues, which is really great to see. As part of the SaaS platform, let's talk about Ocean. Ocean is emerging as a leader and patient engagement and referral solutions. Most recently, OceanMD referral platform was selected by the province of Nova Scotia, which will make a surgical consult referrals easier and reduce wait time for patients. The referral software allows primary care providers to send the request to surgeons through the Ocean referral network instead of faxing, e-mailing or many. Already, the dominant e-referral solution in the province of Ontario, we feel OceanMD has the potential to beat the e-referral standard across the country. And we are currently [indiscernible] process for additional e-referral related proposals in other provinces across Canada.\nMeanwhile, the technology assets acquired from CloudMD have been well integrated into our Provider Solutions group with [indiscernible] EMR completing our acquisitions for the [indiscernible] EMR-based providers and clinic a sitting in with our building and revenue cycle management division. Also, as [indiscernible] pointed out earlier, cybersecurity and data protection had its best quarter ever in Q1. But being a [indiscernible] business, we don't expect this level of activity in the second quarter. Hence, we are expecting our overall SaaS and technology services revenue to experience a slight decline in Q2 as compared to Q1.\nIn summary, we're very pleased with our financial performance thus far in 2023 and look forward to delivering strong results again for the rest of the year. Our outlook for 2020 remains positive. Hence, I'm confident in raising our annual guidance again. We have many tailwinds driving growth in the business, and we have a committed and discipline to ensure that we're able to execute on our objectives. Finally, I'd like to thank you all for joining us on the call today and thank our shareholders and investors for all of their support. The capital markets has been supportive of our vision and provided us with the funding needed to pursue our goals and, of course, power and tech enable our health care providers. I would also like to thank WELL's senior management team and our employees and contractors for their tremendous effort. In particular, I'd like to thank our team of health care practitioners and other frontline workers who provide unbelievable patient care every single day. They remind us why we are here and what we are doing to support them. Thank you. And with that, we'd like to open the call for questions. Operator?"

My name is Jenny, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time all participants are listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session later in the call, which will be restricted to analysts only. Please note, this conference is being recorded.\nI will now turn the call over to Tyler Boba, Manager, Investor Relations. Mr. Baba, you may begin.\n\nTyler Baba\n\nThank you, operator, and welcome, everyone to WELL Health fiscal third quarter financial results conference call for the 3 months ended September 30, 2023. Joining me on the call today are Hamed Shahbazi, Chairman and CEO; and Eva Fong, the company's CFO. I trust that everyone has received a copy of our financial results press release that was issued earlier today.\nPortions of today's call, other than historical performance, include statements of forward-looking information within the meaning of applicable securities laws, including future-oriented financial information and financial outlook information. These forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors, many of which are outside of WELL control and that may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of WELL to differ materially from the anticipated results, performance or achievements implied by such forward-looking statements.\nThese factors are further outlined in today's press release and in our management discussion and analysis. We provide forward-looking statements solely for the purpose of providing information about management's current expectations and plans regarding the future. We do not undertake or accept any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements to reflect any change in our expectations or any change in events, conditions, assumptions, or circumstances on which any such statement is based, except if it is required by law. We may use terms such as adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross margin, adjusted EBITDA, shareholder EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted free cash flow on this conference call, all of which are non-GAAP and non-IFRS measures.\nFor more information on how we define these terms, please refer to the definition set out in today's press release and in our management discussion and analysis. The company believes that adjusted EBITDA is a meaningful financial metric as it measures cash generated from operations, which the company can use to fund working capital requirements, service future interest and principal debt repayments, and fund future growth initiatives. Adjusted EBITDA should not be constructed as an alternative to net income or loss determined in accordance with IFRS.\nAnd with that, let me turn the call over to Mr. Hamed Shahbazi, Chairman and CEO.\n\nHamed Shahbazi\n\nFounder, Chairman & CEO\n\nThank you, Tyler, and good day, everyone. We hope that you're all keeping safe and healthy. We appreciate everyone for joining us today. We are extremely pleased to be with you today and discuss our strong momentum and record-breaking quarter in which we achieved record revenue, record adjusted EBITDA and record patient visits. We remain committed to the company's continued focus on tech-enabling healthcare providers and supporting them and simplifying their work lives, modernizing and digitizing their clinical practices and delivering the best healthcare possible.\nDuring Q3 2023, WELL delivered over 1 million patient visits in the quarter through our physical and virtual clinics and over 1.58 million technology and care interactions. WELL now services more than 33,000 healthcare providers with our SaaS and technology services in Canada, which is equal to approximately 1 out of every 3 healthcare providers in the country. We're extremely passionate about supporting our providers. And every day, we focus on supporting them better. This attitude and focus is what has allowed the company to continue to witness healthy growth across all its business segments, including both online and in-person care channels with minimal impacts due to recession, inflation, supply chain, or other macroeconomic effects.\nWe're pleased to report that all of our business units are executing very well, and we're expecting to have strong performance for the remainder of 2023 and into 2024. We do not foresee any material influences or challenges that would impair our ability to deliver solid results in 2024 as we're poised to invest in and achieve significant growth while delivering on sustained profitability. For the fourth quarter, we are expecting to achieve record revenue in both our Canadian and U.S. patient services businesses. With continued improvement in our outlook, I'm pleased to provide an upgrade to our revenue guidance for 2023, which we now expect to be between $755 million to CAD 765 million. Just a reminder, our guidance does not include any unannounced acquisitions. In terms of profitability, we are providing guidance for 2023 annual adjusted EBITDA to increase by a figure approaching 10% over 2022 levels.\nOur revenue growth continues to outpace our EBITDA growth due to the following 2 reasons: One, we continue to reinvest any excess cash flow back into the business for growth. This is most demonstrated in the case of our U.S. digital healthcare businesses, Circle and WISP, who have had strong top line growth but who have both gone through a period of heavy reinvestment over the past few quarters. Two, the recent acquisitions of the MCI One Health clinics have and will have a negative impact on our EBITDA profile Q4 performance. As we've conveyed at the time of our acquisition, these clinics were not profitable, but we have initiated our clinic transformation process, where we have had an excellent track record in digitizing and modernizing our acquired clinics and improving their operating profit margins.\nThis is what we do, and we have a proven track record of improving growth and profitability of our acquired assets. As such, we continue to believe that they will be profitable in 2024 and thus accretive to our results. Looking forward to next year, I'm really excited to introduce our revenue guidance of achieving more than $900 million in 2024 in revenues. We will provide more detailed guidance ranges for 2024 revenue and adjusted EBITDA when we report our 2023 annual results in March 2024. However, we wanted to provide you with some early indications of our confidence level in 2024. In the past, I've mentioned our goal to achieving $1 billion in annual revenue within 2 years. With the revenue guidance of $900 million that I provided today, we're clearly within reach of that $1 billion milestone, likely a little quicker than I had mentioned before. Keep in mind that our target of achieving over $900 million next year does not include any unannounced acquisitions. Given our current pipeline of compelling acquisition opportunities, we have visibility into potentially achieving $1 billion revenue run rate by the end of 2024.\nBefore I turn the call over to Eva, I'd like to highlight our Canadian clinic business. Our Canadian business is firmly the largest and most comprehensive provider of tech-enabled care in Canada and is generating significant profitability. In Q3, we achieved $12.3 million in adjusted EBITDA in Canada, an increase of 24% compared to Q3 2022. Furthermore, EBITDA generated in Canada primarily goes to shareholder EBITDA given the small noncontrolled interest that we have in the Canadian market. This increase in profitability in our Canadian business is proof that our business model is working. As we've indicated before, our business in Canada is to tech-enabled healthcare providers. We have the most comprehensive digital platform in the country that covers practice management, billing, digital patient engagement capabilities, data protection, and a lot more.\nWe have 2 ways in which doctors can interact with our platform. One, on an a la carte basis, they can subscribe to whichever services they like and have them implemented in their patient services business; or two, they can join one of our physical or virtual clinics where our technologies and tools are provided on a fully managed service. What we have learned since providing our services is that increasingly, doctors don't want to run their own clinics and are seeking us out to become their operating partners. As such, we have purchased or recruited entire clinics in order to better support doctors that work in such clinics. Once the new clinic is added to our network, our team employs our clinic transformation program, which includes extensive use of our own digital practitioner enablement platform and shared services program to modernize and digitize these clinics, which generally result in improved cost efficiency and operating support for physicians. Depending on the state of the acquired absorb clinics, it can take anywhere from a few weeks to a few months, and in some cases, can take more than 1 year.\nWe believe the Canadian market continues to be an enormous untapped potential for WELL and very much remains a land grab opportunity, while O'Regan operates the largest network of clinics across the 4 most populous provinces of Canada, namely Ontario, Quebec, BC and Alberta, providing multiple services, including primary care, diagnostic, allied health, specialized care, and now our recently announced Longevity medical services. With 168 clinics in 98 facilities in Canada, we are the largest player, and we've just achieved just shy of 1% market share of this large multibillion-dollar opportunity. We believe we can grow our Canadian business to multiples of its current size, which could on a stand-alone basis, exceed over $1 billion in business in the future on its own.\nAs we have indicated before, the Canadian market for healthcare clinics is extremely fragmented with very few large clinic chains existing in the country, which have 20 or more clinics. Acquiring smaller clinics can be laborious and difficult work, but we are pleased to report that the number of clinics and physicians that are now seeking WELL out specifically due to our growing posture in the industry has been tremendous awareness and affinity to our brand continues to grow. And due to this reason, we believe that our organic growth in recruitment will significantly grow in 2024.\nWith that, I would now like to turn the call over to our CFO, Eva Fong, who will review the financials for the fiscal third quarter 2023, and then I'll come back and provide further commentary on our business units and outlook. Eva?\n\nEva Fong\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, Hamed. I'm pleased to report that we had very strong results for the 3 months ended September 30, 2023. Our overall third quarter results were as follows: WELL achieved record quarterly revenue of $204.5 million in Q3 2023, an increase of 40% as compared to revenue of $145.8 million generated during Q3 of last year. This growth was driven by acquisitions and organic growth. Year-to-date, WELL has achieved organic growth of 16%. WELL achieved record adjusted gross profit of $94.2 million in Q3 2023, an increase of 21% as compared to adjusted gross profit of $78.2 million in Q3 of last year. Growth in the company's adjusted gross profit is attributable to higher revenue in the period. Adjusted gross margin percentage was 46.1% in Q3 2023 compared to adjusted gross margin percentage of 53.6% in Q3 of last year. The decline in adjusted gross margin percentage is mainly attributed to the acquisition of businesses with lower gross margin percentage.\nWELL achieved record adjusted EBITDA of $28.2 million in Q3 2023, an increase of 3% as compared to adjusted EBITDA of $27.5 million in Q3 of last year. For context, last year's results included $4.8 million more EBITDA from our U.S. digital health subsidiaries, Circle Medical and WISP prior to our decision to reinvest more of this EBITDA to continue to drive growth in their businesses. Shareholder EBITDA or adjusted EBITDA attributable to WELL shareholders was $22.9 million in Q3 2023, an increase of 13% as compared to adjusted EBITDA attributable to WELL shareholders of $20.2 million in Q3 2022. Adjusted net income was $12.8 million or $0.05 per share in Q3 2023 as compared to adjusted net income of $14.8 million or $0.07 per share in Q3 2022. Shareholders' free cash flow was $9.6 million in Q3 2023, a decrease of 16% as compared to shareholder free cash flow of $11.4 million in Q3 of last year. WELL generated 10% of this revenues from truly recurring and subscription revenues and 88% of its revenues from its highly recurring patient services revenues in Q3 2023. This means that approximately 98% of its revenues are highly predictable. I will now review our cemented third quarter results.\nOur Canadian Patient Services business achieved another record quarter with revenue of $57.8 million in Q3 2023, an increase of 27% as compared to $45.5 million in Q3 2022, driven by healthy organic growth in our primary care clinics and the acquisition of the MCI clinics in Alberta. Our WELL Health USA Patient Services revenue was $130.7 million in Q3 2023, an increase of 52% as compared to $85.8 million in Q3 2022. Revenue growth over the past year was due to growth in all 3 of WELL Health USA lines of business, Circle Medical, WISP and [indiscernible]. SaaS & Technology Services revenues were $15.9 million in Q3 2023, a year-over-year increase of 10% as compared to $14.5 million in Q3 of last year and an increase of 20% as compared to $13.3 million in the prior quarter Q2 2023. The increase in revenue was due to a bounce back in our cybersecurity and data protection business in the third quarter as well as organic growth in our remaining SaaS and services platform business.\nWELL ended Q3 2023 with a solid balance sheet. As at September 30, 2023, WELL had cash and cash equivalents of $42 million and restricted cash of $3 million. WELL continues to be in good standing and fully compliant with all covenants related with this 2 credit lines, JPMorgan in the U.S. and Royal Bank in Canada. The debt from the 2 credit lines was approximately CAD 293 million as of September 30, 2023. I'm also pleased to report world's shareholder leverage ratio reduced from 2.9x as at the end of Q3 2022 to 2.6x as of Q3 2023. We defined leverage ratio as net bank debt less cash on hand, divided by shareholder-adjusted EBITDA. We exclude convertible debentures from this calculation because convertible debentures are not included in our bank covenants. Over the past year, the improvement in WELL leverage ratio was achieved by an increase in shareholder-adjusted EBITDA. In terms of our share capitalization, as of November 13, 2023, WELL had 258,385,460 fully diluted securities issued and outstanding.\nThat is my financial update, and I turn the call back over to Hamed.\n\nHamed Shahbazi\n\nFounder, Chairman & CEO\n\nThank you, Eva. I'll now provide some specific outlook on our business units. First, our primary care business. During the third quarter, Canadian Primary Care revenue increased by 51% compared to Q3 2022 driven by the acquisition of 5 Calgary-based clinics from MCI One Health and organic growth of 16%, which is much higher than industry averages. I've already commented extensively on our primary care growth opportunity at the beginning of our remarks, but I'll just reiterate that we believe primary care will maintain strong absolute and organic growth, not only through Q4, but all through 2024 and hopefully beyond. Our outlook for primary care continues to look strong for the fourth quarter and beyond, notwithstanding the transformation and retooling work that we've been doing on the acquired MCI clinics in Q4, which will have a temporary negative impact on our P&L. As we go through the process of digitizing and modernizing these clinics, we expect them to become profitable in 2024.\nLast thing I'll say about primary care is that our recruitment pipeline is very strong and perhaps the best we've ever seen it. We believe this is directly correlated with the challenges doctors are feeling in the marketplace and WELL's growing brand recognition. We believe 2024 could be a breakout year for primary care. Now a few words about MyHealth. MyHealth had an outstanding third quarter with strong year-over-year growth of 9%, which was all organic and improved profitability. MyHealth's revenue had a slight decline in Q3 compared to the prior quarter Q2 2023 due to normal seasonality as we had anticipated. In reference to Ontario's built 60 Your Health Act, which allows out-of-hospital facilities to perform publicly funded surgeries and diagnostic procedures, including MRI and CT, we continue to await the final regulations and call for applications for licensing, which experienced some delays.\nAlthough exact timelines are not publicly released, we anticipate a call for applications to occur by the end of this year or in early Q1 2024. MyHealth Center continues to be highly engaged through the process with the optimism of serving the patients of Ontario and helping reduce MRI/CT patient wait times the following calendar year. Notwithstanding our continued progress on profitable organic growth, we are also ramping up our M&A efforts at MyHealth to find suitable acquisitions to grow the business. Given our corporate discipline, we have not made any acquisitions here in the last couple of years, mainly due to the persistently high multiples we've been seeing. We're starting to see signs of improvement in this area and are eager to report wins in the future. I will now discuss the outlook for the WELL Health USA business.\nThe different lines of business under WELL Health USA include CRH, anesthesia, CRH O'Regan, RADAR Healthcare Providers, Circle Medical and WISP. First, CRH and RADAR. CRH having an outstanding year so far with Q3 revenues up 73% compared to Q3 of last year. Anesthesia cases continue to grow and ligator sales also increased 12.5% in Q3 compared to the prior quarter. The CRH received a boost in revenues in Q3 from the CarePlus acquisition, which included the addition of ASC practices and radar, which is a staffing and low-component service, which specializes in anesthesiologist recruitment and placement for its network of customers, which includes provider groups, hospitals and ASCs across 29 states. RADAR adds significant upside for growth and diversification beyond clinical anesthesia services to include recruitment services. We're very pleased to be welcoming RADAR Healthcare Providers to the WELL family. We expect continued growth in Q4 for both CRH's anesthesia services and RADAR. Q4 is usually the strongest seasonal quarter for CRH.\nAnd now a few words about Circle Medical. With less energy being devoted to regulatory issues, Circle Medical is again poised to resume its growth trajectory. Circle Medical continues to grow its provider network, ending the quarter with 341 active medical providers, a year-over-year increase of 48%. This is a significant achievement and one that we know is the key to see more growth and profitability. We're seeing record growth in new patients with new patient acquisitions up 30% in Q3 sequentially. New patient acquisitions were up a further 14% month-over-month in October alone. As these new cohorts mature, they will produce additional revenue in Q4 and beyond.\nTo support its growth plan, Circle Medical is investing heavily in its technology platform by growing its product and technology team with most hires based in the Montreal office. Product development is currently focused in 2 areas: one, patient-facing features designed to strengthen the longitudinal primary care relationship, which will drive engagement and clinical outcomes and eventually lifetime value; and two, technology to help scale operations, especially via automation and artificial intelligence. Circle Medical has begun using its own AI scribed to document encounters and is working on extending the use of AI to help monitor clinical quality. Moreover, MedCircle Medical is in the early discussions with HEELWELL to pilot a program to use AI to identify patients who may benefit from being screened for rare diseases or other medical interventions. In September, the company hired a new head of Growth, Catherine David, in Catherine's previous role, she grew a venture-backed U.K. company from GBP 20 million to GBP 400 million in annual revenue over 5 years. With 1 month down in Q4, we can already tell that Circle Medical will likely deliver record revenues and positive EBITDA in Q4.\nAnd now for WISP, I'm pleased to report that WISP reported record revenue in Q3 as the company returns to its focus to growth and profitability. Last quarter, we discussed how WISP is recooling some of its key product and distribution partners, which resulted in slower growth and minimal adjusted EBITDA contribution in the first half of the year. With has been able to successfully balance growth initiatives, along with the launch of an improved e-commerce-enabled marketing site, which also is enhancing its supply chain redundancy and partnerships. Last quarter, we discussed with plan to launch 10 new products before the end of the year and remain on track to hit this goal. Most notably, WISP launched 5 new products in Q3, including Estradiol, marking the company's entrance into the menopause vertical. We expect WISP to report record revenue in Q4 with improved profitability as the business leans into the holiday season. In addition, we expect pulling back on some of our marketing spend due to high seasonal cost of advertising, while accelerating marketing spend again in January of 2024 when we have lower seasonal cost of advertising.\nAnd finally, our SaaS and technology services business. SaaS and technology, our business unit had a bounce back in -- bounce back quarter in Q3. As we discussed last quarter, the cybersecurity and data protection segment is a lumpy business, whose revenues declined in the second quarter as we had expected. Cybersecurity revenues can sometimes be impacted by timing of hardware shipments at the end of the quarter. Revenues improved in Q3 with several contracts delivered while the rest of the SaaS and services business continue to perform with steady growth and profitability. We also recently announced the acquisition of 2 strategic tuck-in cybersecurity businesses Seek Into and Proact security.\nThese acquisitions demonstrate well steadfast commitment to safeguarding patient trust and operational integrity. WELL has bolstered, its cybersecurity portfolio with these 2 strategic tuck-in acquisitions, bringing on board seasoned cybersecurity professionals in the process and strengthening our capability to serve over 190 corporate and government customers across North America.\nDuring Q3, we announced also that OceanMD signed a $38.5 million contract with British Columbia's Public Health Service Authority to provide an array of digital services such as eReferrals, e-consult and e-orders to help further tech enable providers with best-in-class interoperability tools. OceanMD is already the dominant eReferral solution in the province of Ontario. In Q2, we announced OceanMD had 1 that Nova Scotia eReferral bid. And with this win in BC, we feel OceanMD has the potential to become the eReferral standard across the country.\nThus far, our implementation in BC has been proceeding as planned. We've received tremendous interest with over 250 doctors signed up to participate before any participant recruiting has even begun. Doctors of BC has been fully engaged and supportive. We've already begun to receive services revenue as our teams are fully engaged with training and planning for launch. Go Live is expected in the first half of 2024, at which time we will also start to receive high-margin license revenue. OceanMD is a key component of our SaaS and technology services group and is emerging as a leader in patient engagement and eReferral solutions. Ocean's eReferral software allows primary care providers to send their request to surgeons through the Ocean eReferral Network instead of faxing, e-mailing or mailing, which makes up surgical consult referrals easier and reduces wait times for patients. OceanMD has notably proven its ability to reduce wait times by as much as 52 days and a 12% reduction in medically unnecessary MRIs, underlining a direct cost savings impact for provincial health systems.\nWe're pleased to report that Ocean is now delivering approximately 1 million eReferral events per year. This is a real achievement, and we're very proud of the Ocean team for making the positive impact it is making in the Canadian healthcare ecosystem. In Q3, healthcare providers also continue to embrace WELL AI voice and its ability to cut down on administration time and increase patient engagement, giving physicians back time in their day. The adoption metrics of WELL AI voice are a testament to the value created for physicians. WELL AI voice has seamlessly integrated in over 15,000 patient consultations in Q3. Reclaiming time for clinicians that was previously lost due to administrative tasks, while enriching patient care quality. In Q3, we've seen a surge in platform users as WELL AI voice saw paid user growth of over 500%. Q3 also marked a successful first rollout to WELL-owned clinics, including WELL AI voice to 23 clinics in British Columbia, WELL physicians leverage WELL AI voice and been scribing over 2,400 patient encounters. Our continued expansion of WELL AI voice within our clinical network demonstrates our dedication to leveraging our AI capabilities to benefit WELL physicians and our broader clinic network. Overall, our technology platform services group continues to perform with the rollout of AI-based tools and achieving record sales in Q3 in both Oscar EMR and our billing RCM products.\nI'd now like to provide some additional commentary on the launch of HEALWELL AI. We recently completed our oversubscribed financing transaction with previously named NCI One Health, resulting in the relaunch of a new senior-listed public company called HEALWELL AI, a pure-play healthcare AI and data science technology company focused on preventative care. We are very pleased with the successful launch of HEALWELL, who has garnered immense interest and raised additional equity financing to strengthen its balance sheet. Since WELL's involvement was initially announced, the company has gone from a market capitalization of less than $10 million back in May to more than $100 million on an as converted basis. WELL has entered into a strategic alliance agreement with HEALWELL that enabled us to launch WELL AI decision support to our network of clinics and doctors.\nWe believe this will become one of the most important services that we offer. This is because we believe the experience of being a physician will profoundly change over time. Physicians are currently expected to know everything about their patients, including patients that they haven't even had long tenured relationships with. Given that some patients who have chronic or complex care needs may have hundreds or even thousands of pages of clinical nodes, it is unrealistic for physicians to be expected to have a dynamic understanding of all their patients' charts and detailed requirements. We believe this is where AI technology can be extremely useful and helpful. We expect that over time, decision support will support physicians in the following ways: one, help them improve their accuracy of diagnosis, particularly for the thousands of rare and ultrarare diseases, many of which have known successful interventions once identified. Two, help physicians search patient records with much greater ease as unstructured clinical nodes become structured and searchable through the use of artificial intelligence. And three, allow patients to see more patients as they're able to more effectively and rapidly triage patients, especially as such patients have complete health history available within the provider network.\nWELL AI decision support will be a project that will entail progress over a multiyear period given the enormity of the scope and the objectives being sought out. We will keep shareholders posted on our progress with this initiative. Currently, on an as-converted basis, WELL owns approximately 17% of HEALWELL. As part of the investment in strategic alliance, 2 members from WELL were appointed to HEALWELL's Board of Directors and subject to satisfaction of certain conditions, WELL will also hold an option to acquire up to 30 million Class A and B shares in HEALWELL over the next couple of years. Assuming these shares are acquired WELL's economic ownership would be approximately 40% and its voting ownership would be well above 50%. This means that WELL will have an opportunity in the future to acquire control of HEALWELL in the event it elects to acquire the multi-voting shares it is optioned out subject to the terms and conditions of the various agreements, covenants and rights.\nGiven the strong alignment, WELL is spending time and resources to support HEALWELL's growth plan, which is compelling. In summary, we're very pleased with our financial performance thus far in 2023 and look forward to delivering strong results again in 2024. Our outlook remains positive. Hence, I'm confident in upgrading our annual guidance again. We have many tailwinds driving growth in the business, and we have a committed and disciplined team to ensure we can execute on our objectives.\nFinally, I'd like to thank you all for joining us on this call today and thank our shareholders and investors for their continued support. The capital markets have been very supportive of our vision and have provided us with the funding needed to pursue our goals. And thus, we are very grateful to the capital markets for that. I would also like to thank WELL's senior management team and all of our employees and contractors for their tremendous effort. In particular, I'd like to thank our team of healthcare practitioners and other frontline workers who provide unbelievable patient care. They remind us every day why we are here and why we are here to support them. Thank you.\nAnd with that, we are now open to take some questions. Operator, would you please facilitate?"

Second Quarter 2024 Financial Results Conference Call. My name is Ima, and I'll be your conference operator today. [Operator Instructions] Please note that the today's conference is being recorded.\nI will now turn the call over to Mr. Tyler Baba, Manager, Investor Relations. Mr. Baba, you may begin.\n\nTyler Baba\n\nManager of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, operator, and welcome, everyone, to WELL Health's Fiscal Second Quarter Financial Results Conference Call for the 3 months ended June 30, 2024. Joining me today on the call are Hamed Shahbazi, Chairman and CEO; Eva Fong, the company's CFO.\nI trust that everyone has received a copy of our financial results press release that was issued earlier today. Please also note that we will be using some slides to assist us in our presentation today. If you are on a webcast, you will automatically see these. If not, you will need to download these from our investor site on our financials page. Portions of today's call, other than historical performance, include statements of forward-looking information within the meaning of applicable securities laws, including future-oriented financial information and financial outlook information. These forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors, many of which are outside of WELL's control that may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of WELL to differ materially from the anticipated results performance or achievements implied by such forward-looking statements.\nThese factors are further outlined in today's press release and in our management discussion and analysis. We provide forward-looking statements solely for the purpose of providing information about management's current expectations and plans relating to the future. We do not undertake or accept any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements to reflect any change in our expectations or any change in events, conditions, assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based, except if it is required by law.\nWe may use the terms such as adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross margin, adjusted EBITDA, shareholder EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted free cash flow on this conference call, all of which are non-GAAP and non-IFRS measures. For more information on how we define these terms, please refer to the definition set out in today's press release and in our MD&A.\nThe company believes that adjusted EBITDA is a meaningful financial metric as it measures cash generated from operations, which the company can use to fund working capital requirements, service future interest and principal debt repayments and fund future growth initiatives. Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an alternative to net income or loss determined in accordance with IFRS.\nAnd with that, I will turn over the call to Mr. Hamed Shahbazi, Chairman and CEO.\n\nHamed Shahbazi\n\nFounder, Chairman & CEO\n\nThank you, Tyler, and good day, everyone. We appreciate everyone for joining us today. We're extremely pleased to be with you today and discuss our strong momentum and quarter in which we achieved our 22nd consecutive record-breaking revenue quarter, underscoring and the enduring momentum of our company.\nAnd for the first time, we'll be using some slides to assist us in our presentation. As Tyler indicated earlier, if you joined via webcast, you should already see these. If you don't, you can go to our Investors section of our website and either join the webcast or download the slides.\nThe second quarter of 2024 exceeded all our expectations showcasing the continued strength and momentum of our technology-driven Care delivery platforms. We're very proud to report a robust 42% year-over-year revenue growth, of which half or approximately 21% came from organic growth, which includes our clinic absorption. Note that if you exclude our absorption program, enterprise-wide organic growth would have been 16%.\nThe company also experienced 11% year-over-year growth in adjusted EBITDA. We will expand on this later, but we're very pleased to have paid down a significant amount of debt and reduced our leverage ratios in Q2. We're also pleased to have improved annual guidance yet again this quarter. This quarter, we've increased revenue guidance to between $970 million and $990 million for the year. It should be noted that for the purposes of assessing 2024 annual organic growth, we estimate that our 2023 pro forma revenue would have been approximately $849 million if all of our 2023 acquisitions excluding clinic absorptions that occurred on January 1, 2023, and excluding all but one month of Intrahealth, which was sold on February 1, 2024.\nNote that this number differs from what was disclosed in the notes to our 2023 audited financial statements. It's that pro forma number included clinic absorptions, intra health and a number of other adjustments. As such, the midpoint of our updated guidance in further organic growth rate, including absorptions of 15.4% for the year.\nAs for adjusted EBITDA, we are maintaining our previous guidance which was just increased last quarter to the upper range of $125 million to $130 million despite incurring higher costs due to our projection of significantly lower share issuance and stock-based incentives. We also reiterate our guidance introduced last quarter for free cash flow available to shareholders to be approximately $55 million for the year.\nKeep in mind that this target guidance does not include any unannounced acquisitions. If we include any material acquisitions, there is a fairly good chance that we would be ahead of our current guidance range, notwithstanding any potential material divestments.\nOur pipeline of acquisitions continues to be strong, particularly in our Canadian clinics division, where we have significant opportunities for acquisition or absorption of clinics. In addition, keep in mind that the second half of the year is typically a stronger -- typically stronger for us in terms of EBITDA generation, and we continue to maintain guidance for improving free cash flow attributable to shareholders to approximately $55 million, representing a 30% year-over-year increase from 2023.\nMoving on to operational highlights. Central to our identity is our commitment to providing highly competent, reliable and tech-enabled support to health care providers. As of the end of Q2 2024, over 3,900 providers and clinicians deliver care across our physical and virtual clinics. Of that number, I'm proud to announce that we've achieved approximately 1,000 physicians serving patients within our WELL clinics in Canada. Remember that there are likely less than 100,000 physicians in the entire country, serving our $330 billion health care ecosystem. So we can proudly state that approximately 1% of all health care providers or physicians make a WELL clinic their place of practice, truly remarkable milestone.\nIn addition, there are more than 37,000 providers benefiting from our SaaS and technology services, which is approaching approximately 40% of all physicians in Canada, supported by our platform in some way. WELL achieved a record 1.4 million patient visits in Q2, an increase of 38% as compared to Q2 of 2023, representing 5.6 million patient visits on an annualized run rate basis.\nPatient visits were comprised of 759,000 patient visits in Canada and 640,000 patient visits in the United States. Canadian Patient Services visits increased 41%, while U.S. Patient Visits increased 34% on a year-over-year basis. I'd like to point out that organic growth in patient visits, including absorptions in Canada was 25.5%. If you strip out absorptions, same clinic growth in visits was 11.4%, which one must remember is much higher, and we would guess to be about triple the growth rate of traditional organic growth figures in terms of Canadian health care, which are typically in the 3% to 4% range.\nI would like to now move on to describing some of the key themes for today's call. One, our various strategies to unlock sum of parts value; two, our plans to spin out our SaaS and services provider solutions line of business as a controlled public company; and three, our efforts to improve per share metrics by reducing dilution and stock-based compensation, improving profitability and improving shareholder value; and four, we will also be making some important commentary about our clinic consolidation program and the progress we've been experiencing there, too.\nOn to unlocking some of the parts. This is something that we covered off at Investor Day, but we'd like to revisit a bit today. WELL is a diverse and multifaceted health care technology company with multiple business lines operating across both the U.S. and Canadian markets. While it's natural for there to be a small discount to the multiple holdings of the conglomerate, such as WELL, we believe that the discount currently associated with WELL far exceeds the normal conglomerate or holding company discount. And we believe this is an opportunity for those investors who are looking for hidden but realizable value.\nWhile some of that discount has been corrected since our Investor Day, we believe that there's still an approximately an $800 million to $1 billion discount to our true sum of parts. As you'll see in today's presentation, these overlooked segments are not only strong performance, but they're also experiencing significant growth and momentum. Therefore, we propose a sum of parts valuation approach to more accurately assess the company towards.\nWe believe that unlocking the value of some of our assets through third-party, arm's length investments or divestments, could go a long way to highlight this value. In the case where divestments occur, such cash benefits could be material and could be likely used to pay down debt or to issue a special buyback or make additional accretive acquisitions.\nLast quarter, we indicated that we had begun considering strategic alternatives for our U.S. patient digital patient services businesses, Circle Medical and Wisp. We do not believe that the capital markets are signing a fair value for these 2 assets as part of WELL given their high growth and improving fundamentals. Both Circle and Wisp are higher-growth businesses that would essentially be valued generally on a price to sales basis, given their limited but improving EBITDA generation.\nWhereas WELL is primarily valued on a price to EBITDA basis, which creates a dislocation in value which results in unrealized or hidden sum of parts value. In addition, WELL as a call option for both of these businesses, which provides us with several alternatives, including acquiring the remaining ownership of the businesses, seeking an IPO or RTO or selling the businesses entirely. We have hired professional advisers to help us with these processes.\nIn the case of Circle Medical, the call option as a time line which has now been extended with the approval of the minority shareholders well into 2025. We are pleased to announce that Circle Medical has retained JPMorgan to evaluate strategic alternatives and help identify partner or partners that will support Circle in its next phase of growth.\nOn the win side of things, we're similarly pleased to report that CIBC Capital Markets is assisting us with our evaluation of strategic alternatives. We will provide updates as they become available on both of these processes, but do not expect update until later this year or especially in the case of Circle Medical early next year.\nIn addition to evaluating strategic alternatives for Circle and Wisp, we started to look at additional opportunities for unlocking value. And we're very pleased to disclose that we are working on another important initiative that we believe will yield significant shareholder value. That's -- and that's related to our Platform Solutions business.\nWe believe our SaaS and Services Provider Solutions business is a very strong candidate as a potential spin out as a well-controlled stand-alone public company. Excluding cybersecurity, our Provider Solutions group achieved external revenue of $10.4 million in Q2 2024 with 86% gross margin, 30% EBITDA margins and 24% organic growth, with over 90% of its revenues contractual and recurring in nature. This is a very healthy and profitable SaaS business with great growth prospects.\nWe believe Provider Solutions group would be valued at a much higher valuation multiple than the value that is currently being afforded to WELL health. In addition, we believe we could accelerate the growth of this business as a stand-alone public company, which would then ramp up its own capital allocation program to ensure it is growing methodically, both organically and inorganically.\nThe Provider Solutions group is an integral part of the Canadian clinics ecosystem that tech enables doctors and other health care providers in our clinic. It's also an area where we have clear market leadership to support health care providers nationally, while our market share ownership in EMR in Canada is third. If you look at the full platform requirements of a health care provider, which include billing management, productivity apps, and other elements, to our knowledge, there is no bigger market share owner in the country than WELL's Provider Solutions entity.\nEven after a prospectus spin out of our Provider Solutions group, what could -- this group will continue to work closely with and support our clinics and clinic transformation team as such, WELL's intentions are to maintain a strong economic and voting majority in this entity even after it spun out as a separate publicly listed company. As such, there should be no real changes to how this entity operates and interact with our own clinics, which is very important to our own development within our WELL clinics ecosystem. We're very excited about this initiative, and we'll provide more updates in the coming weeks and months.\nThe third key theme is one of the most important for the call today, our commitment to delivering improved shareholder value. Last quarter in our conference call, we talked about an important inflection point where WELL was going to focus more intently on optimizing our profit per share metrics by not only improving our overall organic growth and profitability, but also paying quick and significant attention to our dilution and pulling all the levers we could to reduce and eventually fully eliminate and then reverse dilution.\nI'm pleased to note that this quarter, we made excellent progress towards these stated goals. And as Eva will demonstrate later, we were able to actually reduce our fully diluted share totals during the quarter slightly by paying out all of our earn-outs in cash, not issuing any new incentive fair awards, and actually electing to pay some of our incentives in cash, which are long-term incentive plan allows for and buying back some stock.\nWe will be applying the same intensity to managing dilution, driving organic growth, and improving our profitability in subsequent quarters as we look -- as we work hard to realize sum of parts value and significantly elevate shareholder value.\nWith that, I'd now like to turn the call over to our CFO, Eva Fong, who will provide some financial context and color on some of the most important themes of unlocking shareholder value. I'll then come back and provide some further commentary on our lines of business. Eva?\n\nEva Fong\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, Hamed. I'm pleased to report that we have very strong results for the 3 months ended June 30, 2024. Our revenue grew by 42% to $243.1 million, and our adjusted EBITDA grew by 11% to $30.9 million. Our overall second quarter results were very positive. I won't go into too much of the financial details as they are available on SEDAR+, but instead, I will go through our key financial metrics in the next few slides.\nWELL achieved record IFRS net income of $117 million in Q2 2024 compared to a loss of $2 million in Q2 2023. This increase in net income was largely driven by significant unrealized gains of wealth investment in HEALWELL AI. Our net income remains positive even if we exclude unrealized gains from our investments in HEALWELL, which shows the progress we are making overall.\nNotwithstanding this, we think that what is more important than the share price gains HEALWELL has made this year is an incredible improvement it has made in terms of its business execution and fundamentals. HEALWELL current run rate revenue is already surpassing $65 million and it's projected to be approaching $100 million by the end of the year on a run rate basis.\nHEALWELL has also given guidance for reaching profitability in 2025. This is pretty incredible for a company that has less than $10 million in revenues just 10 months ago. At a time line, we may be approaching a period of recession and deflation, it is important to note that HEALWELL is a technology company that is serving the life sciences sector with very steady resilient and defensive revenue streams. This includes doctors, commissions and hospitals for its co-pilot products and the pharmaceutical industry with its real world evidence, scientific research and clinical trials orchestration services. We expect to exercise our call option within the next few quarters, which will further increase growth, economic and voting interest in the company and will end up period of [indiscernible] the unrealized gains on our books.\nAs for the adjusted net income, which adjusts out all unrealized gains such as the HEALWELL share gains recorded in our IFRS net income, it is important to note that we are making progress. I like to point out that last year in Q2 2023, we recorded adjusted net income of $14.4 million. However, this included a onetime realized benefit of $3.5 million worth of income associated with the termination of a management contract by one of the divestment partners of CRH\n[indiscernible] asset. They typically retain a management contract that provides online management fees. If such a contract is terminated, it accelerates the management fees owning. If one were to normalize for this onetime income last year, we see a 13% year-over-year increase to this year's adjusted net income of $12.3 million.\nAs I pointed out earlier by Hamed, WELL is extremely focused on it's per share performance metrics. It has had significant success with its revenue per share going from $0.16 per share in Q1 2021 to over $1 share -- per share as of Q2 2024. But we're much more focused on our adjusted EBITDA and adjusted shareholder EBITDA which removes the noncontrolled interest as well as free cash flow available to shareholders, which we consider to be the most important metric to track as a capital allocator.\nWELL achieved free cash flow to shareholders of $8.7 million in Q2 2024. You'll notice that this shows a sequential decline compared to Q1 2024. This is mainly due to a fact that in Q2, we made 50% of our interest payments for the year for our convertible debentures in the amount of $1.9 million. Also, we were expecting to receive $2.3 million in tax credit in Q2, which were late and actually arrived just a few days ago here in Q3.\nIt is important to note that our Q2 2024 would have been closer to $11 million with these credits added, which would have been a 17% year-over-year increase. We're continuing to maintain our current guidance for free cash flow available to shareholders of approximately $55 million for the year, representing a 30% year-over-year increase, mainly achieved through cost optimization efforts. This is typically important given the current inflationary environment as we do also expect interest rate reductions in the coming months. We're projecting that an expected reduction in interest rates in the coming months will also help with our cash flow.\nIn the past, our focus on M&A has led us to rely on dilution to support our strategy. However, most of this solution has been associated with our acquisitions in previous years rather than our most recent ones, which is evidenced in the decline of our earn-out payments.\nIn 2022, we settled approximately $65.2 million in earn-outs and vendor take back notes and a 10.2% share dilution. In 2023, we reduced our deferred acquisition cost payments by about 55% to $29.4 million and reduce our dilution to 4.4%. Looking forward in 2024, our current expectation is that earn-out payments will further decline by another 20% to approximately $23.5 million, resulting in share dilution of around 3.3% in 2024.\nAs you can see, most of that has already been incurred, and we are only expecting a 30.6% dilution for the balance of the year. Our largest remaining major earn-outs pertain to Ocean, DoctorCare and MyHealth, as we have not committed to a new material earn-out arrangement since 2021. As you can see, next year, we have a $10 million decline in performance earn-out payables and then again a major drop of another $10 million to a very small amount in 2027.\nPlease keep in mind that our performance earn-outs are tied to performance, so we would only be paying these projected figures if assets such as MyHealth, Ocean and DoctorCare, continue to perform, which we expect will be the case.\nTo further decrease our dilution, we are working on moving our employee incentive programs to be more cash based rather than share-based compensation programs, which we expect will result in an over 60% decline in share-based compensation awards in 2024 as compared to 2023, where we have some [indiscernible] plans that exceeded our normal course of grant schedule. We expect this will further decline in 2025.\nWhile we have increased our cash expenses, we are maintaining previous EBITDA and free cash flow guidance, which was recently increased last quarter. In Q2, there were no new incentive shares issued in the quarter. In terms of our share capitalization, as you can see, WELL actually reduced its 40 diluted shares outstanding in Q2 2024. This is because we paid out all our time-based earn-out in cash and did not issue any new incentive shares in Q2 and WELL also purchase and returned 119,000 shares to tertiary in Q2 2024.\nLast year, during Q2 2023, we have issued about 389,000 shares for acquisitions and earn-out payments. Following along with the focus of reducing share dilution as of the end of Q2 2024, the company has used its approved NCIB to repurchase 163,500 shares at an average price of $3.83. Our repurchases are methodical and continuos as we believe that this -- they demonstrate a key focus on managing and reducing share dilution. Our intent is to continue to repurchase shares in the coming months and to extend our strategic alternatives processes, yield additional cash resources.\nWe will undertake to increase our buyback rate as the company's Board of Directors believe WELL current share price does not adequately reflect the underlying value based on WELL's business prospects and financial position.\nLooking at our balance sheet at the end of Q2 2024. While in the Q2 2024 with a solid balance sheet, as of June 30, 2024, WELL had cash and cash equivalents of $46.5 million. WELL continues to be understanding and fully compliant with all companies related with its 2 credit lines, JPMorgan in the U.S. and World Bank in Canada. The debt on the 2 credit lines was approximately CAD 289 million as of June 30, 2024. [indiscernible] at the U.S. dollar did strengthen during the period, so it's important to note that we were able to reduce our U.S. debt facility USD 152.3 billion to USD 148.8 million during the quarter.\nWhilst shareholder leverage ratio was 2.67x as at the end of Q2 2024 compared to 2.75x as at the end of Q1 2024. We defined leverage ratio as net bank debt less cash on hand, divided by shareholder adjusted EBITDA.\nOn a constant currency basis, our leverage ratio was 2.65x. [indiscernible] includes our convertible debentures, which are turned out for more than 2 years, our leverage ratio would be approximately 3.45x. Given our trajectory of improved EBITDA and capital efficiency, we are projecting improvements to our leverage ratio over the next couple of quarters.\nLastly, one housekeeping item before I turn the call back to Hamed. I wanted to provide some additional commentary on the buildup in our accounts receivable [indiscernible]. As we noted previously, the CRH Anesthesia business has experienced delays in cash collections on anesthesia claims, including delay billing and as a result of this billing change health care, who experienced -- who's experiencing a cybersecurity incident in February 2024.\nCRH has continued to provide anesthesia [indiscernible] outage. And as a result, accounts receivable relating to these claims has increased. Understanding the significant business interruption this has caused, [indiscernible] Healthcare has provided advanced funding to CRH in lieu of the cash collections CRH would normally [indiscernible] related to these claims with the expectation that upon resuming normal billing and collection activities. The advanced funding will be replayed as cash collections from payers and patients [indiscernible] received.\nGiven the contractual terms underlying advanced funding received, these funds have been recorded within other liability as at June 30, 2024, totaling USD 58 million. Hence the related increase in other liabilities during the quarter, which offset the increase in accounts receivables.\nThat is my financial update, and I turn the call back over to Hamed.\n\nHamed Shahbazi\n\nFounder, Chairman & CEO\n\nThank you, Eva. Performance of our Canadian Patient Services business has been exceptionally strong, generating $76.7 million in revenue in Q2 2024. We an increase of 42% from Q2 2023 and is ahead of our previous guidance of achieving $300 million in revenue in 2024.\nLet's first look at the primary care segment as part of our Patient Services group. The company's primary care business unit generated revenue of $45.5 million in Q2 2024, an increase of 83% compared to Q2 2023. This increase relates primarily to the acquisitions of MCI, Ontario and Alberta based medical clinics and the large Manitoba Clinic as well as strong organic growth in existing clinics, including the impact from clinic absorptions over the past 12 months.\nWe are now very closely watching our 2023 cohort of clinic absorptions and acquisitions. Included in the 2023 cohort is the large Manitoba Clinic and the MCI Ontario clinics. Recall these clinics were not profitable and caused downward pressure on our EBITDA margins in Q4 of 2023. I'm proud to announce that the digitization and transformation efforts at these clinics running ahead of plan. And as of today, both Manitoba Clinic and MCI Ontario clinics are running at positive adjusted EBITDA. Going forward, we expect to continue to increase EBITDA margins of these clinics over the next year.\nOur outlook for primary care continues to look strong for the third quarter and beyond, notwithstanding the transformation and digitization work that we are doing on the acquired Shoppers Drug Mart clinics, which have had a temporary negative impact on our P&L. As we go through the process of digitizing and modernizing these clinics, we expect them to become profitable in 2024. And in fact, we are ahead of plan with our work as we are almost at breakeven at these clinics.\nNote that we have owned them for less than 100 days. And when we purchased them, they were significantly negative. So we're very pleased at the progress that we've made here. I will reiterate that we believe primary care will maintain strong absolute and organic growth through 2024 and beyond. Our recruitment absorption and M&A pipelines are very strong and have more than 50 clinics in various stages of pre-LOI DD, LOI and post LOI DD. We believe this is directly correlated with the challenges doctors are feeling in the marketplace and WELL growing brand recognition and ability to execute.\nAnd now a few words about WELL Health Diagnostic centers. WELL Health Diagnostics had a very strong Q2 2024, achieving a total of 172,000 patient visits and record quarterly revenue of $31.2 million, an increase of 7% compared to Q2 2023. Q2 has historically been and continues to be our strongest quarter in this line of business. This performance was driven by organic growth from the expansion of services as well -- and health care providers.\nWe note that both adjusted gross margin and adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue decreased compared to the same quarter in the prior year due to the higher-than-normal EBITDA in the second quarter of 2023 as a result of higher diagnostic consultations in our high-margin nuclear medicine line of business and availability of materials, and lower direct costs due to stock incentives provided to physicians to our earn-out partners of the company, which also occurred in Q2 2023.\nSecond quarter is seasonally our strongest quarter, which is followed by a slower third quarter. For the full year 2024, we are expecting that our WELL Health Diagnostic centers to achieve another year of record revenue and EBITDA. In addition, Cancer Care Ontario has decreased the eligibility age of breast cancer screening from 50 to 40 years of age, which comes into effect in the fall of 2024. This should result in a material increase in demand in mammography screening and overall improvement in Ontario patient care in Q4.\nIn terms of M&A, we continue to have strong discussions with various players in the industry with the hopes and intentions of expanding our diagnostic centers to more provinces and sites in 2024 as well as in Ontario.\nI'll now discuss our U.S. businesses. First, WELL Health USA, which includes CRH and provider staffing. WELL USA increased revenue in Q2 2024 to $93.3 million compared to $63.4 million in Q2 in the previous year. Last year's EBITDA included $4.7 million in revenue directly related with divestment-related impact. If one were to adjust -- Eva has referenced this in her [indiscernible]. If one were to adjust for this, adjusted EBITDA would have increased 7% to $19.6 million.\nCRH has completed the first half of the year now with a full year of integration and operations following the July 2023 acquisition of CarePlus Management. You will recall CarePlus included a traditional practice of anesthesia serving 14 locations. These have now been fully integrated and operate under CRH Anesthesia. CarePlus Management also included the radar provider staffing business, which is a premier and trusted staffing and locum tenens business, specializing in anesthesia across the lower 48 states.\nThis business continues to be extremely complementary to CRH's legacy anesthesia business and provides high revenue growth along with many operating synergies. We expect growth of this segment to continue within anesthesia as well as our plans to expand to other health care specialties.\nDue to health insurance and payer mix shifts, along with patient deductibility -- deductibles, pardon me, generally being met in the last half of the year, we expect both growth and profitability to accelerate in the second half of the year, in line with our seasonal norms.\nAnd now for Circle Medical, where growth accelerated in Q2. Circle's revenue surged to $32 million in Q2 2024, an increase of 53% compared to Q2 2023. It's important to note that we're seeing this along with margin expansion, which is generally not what our competitors are seeing in the industry. Gross margins grew by 500 basis points from 49.4% to 54.4% on a year-over-year basis. Comparatively, if you look at Teladoc, for example, they're citing higher customer acquisition costs which is putting pressure on their margins, while Circle Medical is experiencing lower customer acquisition costs.\nCircle's organic growth was driven by strong patient acquisition, coupled with an expansion of its provider network, we now -- which now consists of 547 medical providers. Looking beyond Q2, the future looks bright. You may have seen that we released a corporate update specifically to update shareholders on Circle Medical yesterday and the company announced that its revenue in July was a record $8.87 million, representing more than 60% increase compared to the same month last year.\nThis means that Circle Medical has now achieved and exceeded the important milestone of USD 100 million run rate while maintaining gross margins of approximately 55%. The company has positioned itself for continued growth with key hires and partnerships. In particular, it is increasing its investment in AI technologies with a focus on leveraging its growing base of data to deliver better care at scale.\nIn July, Circle hired its Head of AI, Miguel Jete. Miguel has over 20 years experience in the field of AI and he most recently was the VP of AI at Rev, a speech technology company, where he built the world's most accurate speech to text engine and previously served as speech scientist at Nuance. Miguel will also lead the company's partnership with Mila, Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute. Mila is the world's largest academic research center for deep learning, bringing together over 1,200 specialized researchers in machine learning.\nAnother key hire is the return of Brent LaRue to Circle Medical in the role of VP product and Patient Experience. Brent's returned to circle signals a renewed focus on product design as a core competency, which will drive further usage and engagement.\nFor Q3, we expect another record revenue quarter with positive adjusted EBITDA as the business goes from strength to strength and we will -- and we reiterate our previous guidance of Circle expecting to be positive EBITDA for the year.\nAnd now an update on Wisp. I'm pleased to report that Wisp reported adjusted -- positive adjusted EBITDA in Q2 '24 with revenue of $24.3 million, an increase of 27% from Q2 2023. More importantly, it improved its profitability with adjusted EBITDA increasing 225% compared to Q2 last year. Adjusted gross margins improved this quarter compared to the same quarter last year due to better pricing negotiations with pharmacy partners as well as prior margins were negatively impacted by significant outage at one of the company's main pharmacy partners.\nAs far as product development is concerned, Wisp has been very busy with its fertility vertical with pre IVF prescription offering. Wisp also launched its new UTI CareKit, while also expanding at home diagnostics, which will be foundational to establishing a longitudinal care model in key new product launches by the end of the year.\nIn July Wisp [indiscernible] was also launched and has seen strong early traction as an annual membership program where patients can access discounts on products as well as exclusive services, think Amazon Prime for Wisp. For Q3, we expect Wisp to see continued growth as the business ramps up marketing spend to lean into summer seasonality.\nAnd finally, our SaaS and services Provider Solutions business. Our SaaS and technology business experienced a revenue increase of 27% in Q2 2024 compared to the previous year. primarily due to the company's cybersecurity division, where external revenue increased by $4.2 million due to acquisitions and timing of larger software project awards. Excluding cybersecurity, revenue from the continuing platform business, meaning excluding IntraHealth, which was sold to HEALWELL in Q1, increased by 22% to $10.4 million. It should be noted that all increases in revenue in this segment were almost entirely organic as there have been no material acquisitions in the last year.\nOn July 10, 2024, we announced the approval of a historic $44 million project, Health Compass II, the largest digital supercluster project ever awarded in advance -- to advance AI-powered tech enablement for care providers. This initiative led by WELL and its consortium partners aims to enhance AI and interoperability in Canadian health care. As a lead commercialization partner and first customer, we will provide expertise and interoperability, enabling the development of new AI tools to support health care providers.\nFurthermore, this quarter, we announced a 5-year collaboration with Microsoft to enhance digital health care across North America, integrating Microsoft's cloud and AI with WELL's platform. This partnership focuses on elevating WELL's scalability and operational efficiency, aiming to transform health care delivery for large enterprises, including the public sector. The collaboration will also modernize WELL's cloud infrastructure, optimize costs, secure data and integrate Azure OpenAI service to advance health care solutions. .\nBefore closing, I want to talk about our path to control investments with HEALWELL AI. When WELL cofounded HEALWELL AI just 10 months ago, its revenues were less than $10 million. The company now has just shy of 400 employees and has surpassed a $65 million revenue run rate, as Eva mentioned earlier, and has provided guidance to approach $100 million by the end of the year, setting the stage for being profitable in 2025, which will be just in time for us to complete our path to control.\nThe company has significantly increased its balance sheet at just this past quarter between reductions in liabilities and new capital injected, there was $43 million of positive impact to its balance sheet. More importantly, the company has established itself as a leader in leveraging artificial intelligence to unlock the value of data for 2 key audiences: health care workers who need co-pilot technologies to better detect disease and pharmaceutical companies who need better real-world evidence and improvements to their research and development processes, leading to better clinical trials orchestration.\nIn fact, HEALWELL is starting to do for CROs or clinical research organizations, what WELL has been doing for health care clinics, which is to modernize and digitize them. This is a trend that we believe will drive the company to hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue and significant profits in the coming years.\nHEALWELL CRO has already served more than 250 pharmaceutical clients. When one starts to combine the ability for HEALWELL AI to find patients, and support the pharmaceutical industry with the next-generation patient finding technology with the vast network of clinical data at WELL, together, we have something truly valuable and globally relevant.\nWe're pleased to remind shareholders that WELL has a call option on 30 million multi-voting shares of HEALWELL, which will give WELL voting control over the company when exercised. We anticipate doing this at some point in time in 2025. HEALWELL will continue to operate as a stand-alone public company, but we will then add all of HEALWELL's top and bottom line activity to WELL's IFRS statements. We look forward to this.\nIn summary, we're very pleased with our financial performance thus far in 2024 and look forward to delivering strong results for the remainder of the year. Our outlook remains very positive. Hence, we are improving our guidance as previously noted. We have a committed and disciplined team to ensure we can execute on our objectives, including our very important strategic initiatives designed to realize sum of parts value, which we believe is central to our plan to drive shareholder value.\nFinally, I want to thank you all for joining us on this call and joining us on this journey. We're thrilled that we get a chance to speak to you and do our best to deliver shareholder value, we're confident that with your support, we will be successful together.\nI would like to thank WELL's senior management team and all our employees and contractors for their tremendous effort, in particular, I'd like to thank our team of health care providers and other frontline workers who provide unbelievable patient care. They are the true heroes of our business, and it's our honor to support them.\nAnd with that, we'd be pleased to take some questions. Operator?"

My name is Michelle, and I'll be your operator for today's call. (Operator Instructions) Please note, this conference is being recorded.\nI will now turn the call over to Pardeep Sangha, Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Sangha, you may begin.\n\nPardeep S. Sangha\n\nVP of Corporate Strategy & IR, WELL Health Technologies Corp.\n\nThank you, operator, and welcome, everyone, to WELL Health's Annual 2022 and Fiscal Fourth Quarter Financial Results Conference Call for 12 and 3 months ended December 31, 2022. Joining me on the call today are Hamed Shahbazi, Chairman and CEO; and Eva Fong, the company's CFO.\nI trust that everyone has received a copy of our financial results press release that was issued earlier today. Portions of today's call, other than historical performance, include statements of forward-looking information within the meaning of applicable securities laws. These statements are made under the safe harbor versions of those laws. Forward-looking statements are necessarily based upon a number of estimates and assumptions that, while considered reasonable by management, are inherently subject to significant business economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies. These forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors, many of which are outside of WELL's control and will cause the actual results, performance or achievement of WELL to differ materially from the anticipated results, performance or achievements implied by such forward-looking statements.\nThese factors are further outlined in today's press release and in our management discussion and analysis. We provide forward-looking statements solely for the purpose of providing information about management's current expectations and plans [remain] to the future. We do not undertake or accept any obligation or undertaking to release publically any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements to reflect any change in our expectations or any change in events, conditions, assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements based except as required by law.\nWe may use terms such as adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross margin, adjusted EBITDA, shareholder EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted free cash flow on this conference call, which are all non-GAAP and non-IFRS measures. For a more information on how we define these terms, please refer to the definition set out in today's press release and in our main discussion and analysis. The company believes that adjusted EBITDA is a meaningful financial metric as it measures cash generated from operations, which the company can use to fund working capital requirements, service future interest and principal debt repayments and fund future growth initiatives. And adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an alternative to net income or loss determined in accordance with IFRS.\nAnd with that, let me turn the call over to Mr. Hamed Shahbazi, Chairman and CEO. Go ahead, Hamed.\n\nHamed Shahbazi\n\nFounder, Chairman & CEO, WELL Health Technologies Corp.\n\nThank you, Pardeep, and good day, everyone. We hope that you're all keeping safe and healthy. We appreciate everyone for joining us today. To start, I'd like to provide some historical perspective on WELL. We recently celebrated the 5-year anniversary of the acquisition of our first 6 clinics in British Columbia, which took place in February of 2018.\nThat was WELL's first acquisition and began our journey into the health care market by tech-enabling health care providers in helping them modernize and digitize their businesses. We've seen an amazing journey, during which time WELL's grown from 0 revenue to completing a record year in 2022, in which we achieved over $625 million on a Q4 annualized revenue run rate basis. More than 1 out of every 4 providers in Canada rely on WELL in some way to power their businesses from practice management solutions to revenue cycle management to provider and patient communication tools such as online patient booking or e-referrals.\nOver the past 5 years, we've both grown organically and inorganically into one of the leading digital health care companies in North America. I'd like to thank the amazing team at WELL, including the health care providers who help make all of this possible. During the past 5 years, we went through an unprecedented global pandemic, during which our health care providers continued to provide incredible care under difficult conditions. The pandemic also accelerated the adoption of virtual care and digitization in the industry. More recently, we've also had to deal with very challenging circumstances, including worker shortages, supply chain difficulties and rising costs brought about by high inflation. On all occasions, our management team, employees and health care providers continued to overcome all these challenges, enabling the company to deliver phenomenal performances quarter after quarter.\nWe are now firmly in the post-pandemic period and witnessing a host of new catalysts that speak to WELL's relevance as a company, and our role in helping health care providers digitize and modernize their practices. And in many cases, help make those practices more economically sustainable.\nCatalysts that we are watching closely as a team and believe active tailwinds for the company are as follows: one, the increased likelihood of more public and private partnerships to support our health care ecosystem announced by political and public health leaders, most recently in Ontario; two, a commitment by federal authorities in Canada to add significant additional funding to help Canada not only improve the sustainability of its health care ecosystem, but also digitize and modernize it; three, the emergence of artificial intelligence, including generative AI to power tools and tech enablement for health care providers, never even conceived or thought before. By the way, this is an area of intense focus for your management team at WELL. We'll discuss this more later. The demonstration, particularly for -- the demonstration, particularly in the United States of how valuable hybrid care networks are to major pharmacies and other institutions. We seem to be in a new golden age of primary care, where there is ramp in innovation and an opportunity to elevate care and better support providers.\nMoving on to WELL's financial performance. We're thrilled to report another record-breaking year, with strong fourth quarter results and significant growth across all key metrics. WELL achieved record annual revenue of $569.1 million for 2022, an increase of 88% over the prior year. I'm proud to report that WELL has healthy cash flows having achieved almost $105 million in operating adjusted EBITDA in 2022, resulting in adjusted free cash flow to shareholders of approximately $49 million. Q4 2022 was also a tremendous quarter for the company. WELL achieved revenue of $156.5 million in the fourth quarter, representing 35% year-over-year revenue growth, most of which was organic.\nThe fourth quarter of 2022 also marks our 16th consecutive quarter of record revenue. The company's growth was driven by acquisitions made over the past year as well as solid year-over-year organic growth, which was 19% for the full year and 20% organic growth in the fourth quarter. WELL achieved record patient engagements over the past year with approximately 3.5 million omnichannel patient visits and 4.9 million patient interactions in 2022. Omnichannel patient visits grew 50% in 2022 compared to the prior year, and total patient interactions grew 86% over the same period.\nThis demonstrates our continued leadership position as the preeminent end-to-end health care company in Canada, while our U.S. businesses continue to exhibit industry-leading growth metrics. Our record revenue, profitability and patient visits are a testament to the company's continued focus on delivering accessible and innovative health care solutions. Additionally, our U.S.-based virtual services businesses continue to perform exceptionally well, further strengthening our position in the North American digital health care market.\nThe company continues to witness healthy growth across all its business segments, including both online and in-person care channels, with minimal impacts due to recession, inflation, supply chain issues or other macroeconomic effects.\nWith that, I would now like to turn the call over to our CFO, Eva Fong, who will review the annual financials for 2022 and fiscal fourth quarter, and we'll then come back and provide further commentary on our business units and outlook. Eva?\n\nEva Fong\n\nCFO, WELL Health Technologies Corp.\n\nThank you, Hamed. I'm pleased to report that we had very strong results for the 3 months and year ended December 31, 2022. Our annual 2022 and fourth quarter results were as follows: WELL achieved record annual revenue of $569.1 million in 2022 compared to revenue of $302.3 million generated during 2021, an increase of 88%, driven by acquisitions and organic growth.\nAdjusted gross profit was $303.3 million in 2022, an increase of 97% compared to $153.7 million in 2021. Adjusted EBITDA was $104.6 million in 2022, an increase of 73% compared to $60.4 million in 2021. Adjusted EBITDA attributable to WELL's shareholders was $76.6 million in 2022, an increase of 82% compared to $42 million in 2021. Adjusted net income was $53.7 million in 2022, an increase of (inaudible) compared to [$16.3] million in 2021. Adjusted free cash flow attributable to WELL's shareholders was $48.8 million in 2022 as compared to $34.2 million in 2021. Adjusted free cash flow is defined as adjusted EBITDA attributable to WELL's shareholders, minus cash taxes, minus cash interest costs and minus CapEx.\nOur fourth quarter results were as follows: WELL achieved record quarterly revenue of $156.5 million in Q4 2022, an increase of 35% as compared to revenue of $115.7 million generated during Q4 2021. This growth was driven by acquisitions and organic growth. WELL achieved record adjusted gross profit of $80.2 million in Q4 2022, an increase of 26% as compared to adjusted gross profit of $63.5 million in Q4 2021. Growth in the company's adjusted gross profit is attributable to higher revenue in the period.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $27.2 million in Q4 2022, an increase of 6% as compared to adjusted EBITDA of $25.7 million in Q4 2021. It is worth noting that we had really strong results in the prior period to Q4 2021, with the highest margins in the CRH history, which included more than $2 million of pandemic-related government incentives, which resulted in exceptionally strong EBITDA performance in Q4 2021.\nAdjusted EBITDA attributable to WELL's shareholders was $21.1 million in Q4 2022, an increase of 18% as compared to adjusted EBITDA attributable to WELL's shareholders of $17.8 million in Q4 2021. Adjusted net income was $12.5 million in Q4 2022, an increase of 24% as compared to adjusted net income of $10.1 million in Q4 2021.\nI will now review the financial performance of our business segments. First, primary care, which includes our primary care clinics, Allied Health and executive health businesses in Canada. Primary care revenues were $70.5 million in 2022, an increase of 36% as compared to $51.7 million in 2021. Annual results were driven by healthy organic growth, clinic acquisitions and higher government payments for health services. Primary care revenues were a record $21.8 million in Q4 2022, an increase of 55% as compared to $14.1 million in Q4 of last year. The (inaudible) acquisition completed in the third quarter and 3 new clinics acquired from CloudMD in the fourth quarter positively contributed to strong Q4 results.\nIn addition, primary care revenues in Q4 2022 benefited from a stabilization payment from the BC's government. This onetime payment of approximately $1.5 million in the fourth quarter is meant as interim funding to help stabilize family practices until a new payment model was implemented in February 2023. Compared to Q3 2022, primary care revenue was positively impacted by seasonality, as the fourth quarter is a seasonally stronger quarter as compared to Q3 as there tends to be an increase in colds, flus and other elements contributing to higher patient volumes.\nSecondly MyHealth. MyHealth achieved record revenues of $104.2 million in 2022, an increase of 146% as compared to $42.5 million in 2021. MyHealth was acquired partners through 2021 and hence, the large revenue growth from 2021 to 2022. In Q4 2022, MyHealth achieved record quarterly revenue of $28.1 million, an increase of 21% as compared to $23.2 million in Q4 of last year. MyHealth benefited in Q4 2022 from management's hard work and continued efforts to alleviate staff shortages experienced in the first half of the year, leading to a higher billable time for many of its diagnostic procedures. MyHealth also benefited in the quarter from the addition of new cardiologists and key management specialists.\nAnd third, I will now talk about CRH performance. CRH revenues were $202 million in 2022, an increase of 52% as compared to $132.5 million in 2021. As CRH was acquired in April 2021, the increase in revenue is mostly attributable to a full year's contribution of CRH revenue and acquisitions. For Q4 2020, CRH revenues were $52.1 million, an increase of 11% as compared to $47.1 million in Q4 of last year. In addition, revenues also benefited from having a full quarter of contribution from the Grand Canyon Anesthesia acquisition, which is one of the largest acquisitions that CRH has completed since WELL acquired CRH. Compared to Q3 2022, CRH's Q4 2022 results benefited from seasonality as Q4 is CRH's strongest quarter. Case volumes were also very strong for CRH in Q4 with a record of 133,654 anesthesia cases completed in Q4, an increase of 11% compared to Q4 of last year.\nCRH sold 2,138 O'Regan boxes in the fourth quarter. And since each box has (inaudible) units, a total of 42,000 (inaudible) units were sold in the quarter.\nI would also like to provide an update on CRH billing service provider. CRH entered into a relationship with a new billing service provider, Change Healthcare in Q4 2021. Switching to a new provider has benefited the company with a reduction in payment processing fees, resulting in higher margins. However, CRH also experienced a number of onetime transition-related issues, which includes the predecessor billing service provider subsequently resolved and was not able to carry out normal accounts receivable collections, which resulted in bad debt losses related to 2021 revenue.\nAs a result of these events, CRH took this onetime loss and was also precluded from recognizing certain patient services revenue under IFRS 15, and as such, revenues would have been higher had this billing change not occurred. Altogether, (inaudible) has been excluded from the calculation of adjusted EBITDA and these are nonrecurrent and not reflective of ongoing operations. Despite these transition issues and related impacts, we remain confident that the long-term savings from switching to a new billing provider will provider -- will more than compensate for the losses experienced over the past year, as we will ultimately be able to reduce our effective collection rate cost by more than 50%, reflecting over $5 million savings per year.\nIt is also important to note that our new billing service provider offers better data and business intelligence as far -- as well as far superior risk management characteristics, including much better data security. This was a joint undertaken by our CRH team, and I'm very pleased that we are on the other side of this transition as it substantially derisked both the company and position us for better operating performance and improved data quality.\nLastly, virtual services, which includes WELL's U.S.-based Circle Medical and Wisp as well as the company's technology-based solutions, including EMR, billing and revenue cycle management, OceanMD, digital apps and cybersecurity. Virtual services revenues were $192.4 million in 2022, an increase of 154% as compared to $75.6 million in 2021. Virtual services revenue growth was driven by the exceptional growth in the U.S.-based businesses of Circle Medical and Wisp. On a combined basis, these 2 businesses achieved almost $160 million on a revenue run rate basis at the end of 2022.\nVirtual services revenues were $54.5 million in Q4 2022, an increase of 74% as compared to $31.3 million in Q4 of last year.\nWELL ended 2022 and Q4 with a solid balance sheet. As of December 31, 2022, WELL have cash and cash equivalents of $48.9 million. WELL continues to be in good standing and fully compliance with all covenants related to with its 2 credit lines, JPMorgan in the U.S. and Royal Bank in Canada. During the year 2022, we paid down about USD 31 million of the JPMorgan line in the U.S. to arrive at a balance of USD 131.7 million as of the end of the year. In Canada, we borrowed a total of $2.5 million in the year to arrive at the balance of $75.3 million. The total value of our credit line debt as of December 31 was approximately CAD 253.7 million.\nKeep in mind that USD strengthened from an average of $1.26 in Q4 2021 to $1.36 in Q4 2022. And as such, due to the higher exchange rate, our overall debt level would have been lower on a constant currency basis.\nIn terms of our share capitalization, as of March 20, 2022, WELL had 253,793,194 fully diluted securities issued and outstanding.\nThat is my financial update, and I turn the call back over to Hamed.\n\nHamed Shahbazi\n\nFounder, Chairman & CEO, WELL Health Technologies Corp.\n\nThank you, Eva. Now I'd like to speak a bit about our outlook for 2023. We're pleased to report that all of our business units are executing very well as we're expecting to have a strong performance in 2023 across all of our units and for the entire company as a whole. Despite the current geopolitical, inflationary and turbulent economic environment, the company does not see any material influences or challenges that would impair its ability to deliver solid results in 2023. Many of the key variables inherent in the execution of WELL's business are firmly in its own grass and not dependent on outside factors. The company is poised to achieve significant growth, while effectively managing its cost this year. Management is pleased to provide the following guidance for 2023.\nWe expect annual revenues between $665 million and $685 million, representing 17% to 20% annual growth as compared to 2022. Our revenue guidance is above current consensus estimates for 2023. We expect annual adjusted EBITDA to increase by more than 10% over 2022 levels. Our guidance does not include any unannounced acquisitions. As we indicated last quarter, with future acquisitions, we see a clear line of sight to $1 billion in revenues within 3 years as we continue our organic growth and highly accretive clinical tuck-in program.\nAs you may have seen from the guidance, we're expecting our revenue to increase at a higher rate than our adjusted EBITDA this year. There are a few reasons for that. Firstly, we're aggressively reinvesting in growth in our Circle Medical and Wisp businesses. While we expect these 2 businesses to have higher EBITDA contribution this year overall, they will still be immature compared to our other revenue streams and pull down the average a little bit. We are very comfortable with this approach as we're confident that both Circle Medical and Wisp continue to acquire market share and improve their operating EBITDA margins over time as they become more mature businesses. Secondly, we continue to experience the effects of inflationary cost pressures and wage increases. These cost increases are prevalent in all industries today. Although we've implemented cost-saving initiatives, we're still expecting additional cost increases this year as inflation remains at elevated levels.\nAnd lastly, in our CRH business, there are a few factors to be aware of. One, we don't have the benefit of some of the pandemic-related incentives provided by the U.S. government that Eva just spoke about during early 2022, which was equaled more than USD 2 million between Q1 and Q2 last year in 2022. We had some of those incentives in 2021 as well that Eva spoke about.\nTwo, the combined effect of the NSA were No Surprises Act, and our continued move to have our entire payment activity in network will remove some of the elevated billings associated with our out-of-network billings, which we are all anticipating when we bought the company. And three, our most recent large acquisition in the CRH business, Grand Canyon Anesthesia has a lower margin profile than our historic margins for CRH.\nNotwithstanding the above, we're still firmly within the Rule of 30 territory as per the company's previous guidance and direction.\nI'll now provide some commentary on the business units themselves, segmented first with the Canadian Patient Services Group, then U.S. patient services and then SaaS and technology. First, with the Canadian Patient Services business unit. In Canada, WELL owns and operates the largest network of clinics in the country, which includes over 130 clinics being operated in over 80 physical facilities, consisting of primary care, Allied Health, executive health and diagnostic clinics. As we described on our prior calls, WELL strongly believe in the benefits of an integrated health care offering and is bringing together a diverse multidisciplinary offering of its providers in the same setting. This benefits both patients and providers as many of these physical facilities have multiple clinics operating within the same location. For example, we could have a primary care and Allied Health clinic operating out of the same location, or a cardiology clinic and a diagnostic clinic operating out of one of our MyHealth Ontario facilities. That's how we can have more than one clinic in a facility.\nWith over 30 clinics across Canada -- 130 clinics across Canada, we own and operate the largest network. To our knowledge, we deliver more omnichannel patient visits than any other nongovernmental entity in Canada. Furthermore, we're 1 of the top 3 providers of telehealth services in the country. WELL's objective is to continue to grow its patient services business unit, both organically and inorganically and increase its market leadership as the country's first pan-Canadian clinical network with a highly integrated network of tech-enabled outpatient health care clinics. Growth in our Canadian patient services business in 2023 will be driven by continuing to focus on organic growth, which includes recruiting more physicians and absorbing or recruiting clinics themselves and executing on highly disciplined capital allocation opportunities to acquire capable new clinics and networks into the business. These would mostly be small acquisitions.\nI'd love to share with you what we're seeing and why we're so excited about our growth in primary care in Canada. Given recent times where there are challenges with inflation, shortages of health care workers and other issues, WELL has seen dramatically increased relevancy, which is translating into significant growth in interest from care providers that want to join tbis network. As I've mentioned before, in Canada, historically, in many cases, we force health care providers to provide care and run a business, except that now it's become a lot more difficult to run these businesses due to the increased complexity brought about by hybrid and complex workflows, IT, data security and other challenges, making it very difficult for physicians to run even small practices.\nFor this reason, we're seeing more physicians seek WELL out as a professional partner to help them run their business so they can focus on providing care. This is working, and providers are really generating benefits from it because they maintain similar per unit economics, but end up seeing a lot more patients which allows them to elevate care, improve earnings and better support the health care ecosystem.\nI'd like to now quickly comment on opportunities associated with expanding our MyHealth network in Ontario. On January 16, Premier Doug Ford and Health Minister Sylvia Jones announced the Ontario government's new multipronged strategy to reduce wait times by partnering with independent service providers for Ontarians, including areas associated with MRI, CT, colonoscopy endoscopy services. While Ontario-based MyHealth partners is the largest single license holder and service provider for specialty clinics providing diagnostics in the province of Ontario, and we believe is very well positioned to support Ontario government's mandate, particularly in the areas of diagnostic imaging. We intend to apply for these new MRI and CT licenses, which will be provided by the province of Ontario. We anticipate the new licenses will be awarded in the second half of 2023. Although we don't know -- we won't know for several months yet if MyHealth will be ultimately successful in its applications, we would likely incur additional capital cost to purchasing imaging equipment and for leasehold improvements.\nWe anticipate lead times of several months to have these services fully operational in clinics, and as such, we expect minimal revenue generation in 2023. Any such meaningful revenue impact would occur in '24 and beyond.\nI'll now provide some commentary on our U.S. patient services businesses, including CRH, Circle Medical and Wisp. WELL provides omnichannel health care services and solutions across the United States, targeting specialized markets such as the GI market, women's health, primary care and mental disorders. I'll start with CRH. CRH continues to be a nice cash cow for the company. And as a reminder, under the CRH brand, we are the leading provider of sedation services for colonoscopies in the U.S. in an ambulatory setting. In the U.S., WELL continues to expand its clinical presence with anesthesia services now being operated in 126 ambulatory surgery centers and GI clinics across 18 states. In 2022, CRH continued to benefit from post-COVID pent-up demand for endoscopic procedures, and our team's excellent execution in being able to support that elevated demand. We continue to see elevated interest in demand in CRH services and expect another record year of performance by CRH.\nGiven the nature of how health plans and their deductibles work, through the year for elective procedures such as colonoscopy, the fourth quarter is CRH's strongest seasonal quarter. We are expecting CRH revenues to decline in Q1 compared to Q4 and then increase again in each subsequent quarter in 2023, with Q4 2023 again, being the strongest revenue quarter this year. It should be noted that between Q1 and Q2 2022, CRH received more than USD 2 million in pandemic-related government assistance.\nThis grant health offset labor costs and improved EBITDA, which will not be repeated in 2023. In addition, CRH continues to execute on unlocking the value of its O'Regan hemorrhoid banding device intellectual property by creating a clinical offering called GI Rapid Relief that leverages this technology. As of March 21, we now have 11 banding clinics across the United States and Canada.\nI'd now like to discuss WELL's U.S. virtual patient services business, which includes Circle Medical and Wisp. Under the Circle Medical and Wisp brand, we are one of the fastest-growing specialty telehealth businesses focusing on areas such as behavioral health and women's health. Our Circle Medical and Wisp businesses are expected to continue to experience healthy revenue growth in 2023. However, we're purposely reinvesting any cash flows generated by these businesses back into growth, primarily on marketing costs to gain new patients and drive additional revenues. As you may be aware, ad rates are much lower in the first 3 months of the year as compared to the last 3 months of the year. As such, we're taking advantage of this and increasing our marketing spend earlier this year.\nWe will particularly see this effect with Wisp as we're targeting a slightly adjusted EBITDA negative performance in Q1, which will more than be made up in the balance of the year. Our current plan for Circle Medical is to continue to scale their telemedicine business but also now aggressively grow its physical clinic performance or network in 2023, which will improve its hybrid care capabilities and strengthen the company's ability to better support its patients, especially as we see the Biden administration sunset the public health emergency.\nAs of March 1, Circle Medical already had added 3 new clinic locations in Illinois, Florida and New York in addition to its existing operations in San Francisco. Circle Medical is now in the process of adding additional clinic locations in Washington, D.C. and 10 additional states, including Arizona, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Nevada, Texas, Massachusetts, Virginia, Colorado, Tennessee and Maryland. We expect to have clinical coverage across all these states in the coming weeks.\nFinally, SaaS and technology. SaaS and technology includes our WELL EMR Group, billing, revenue cycle management, digital apps, OceanMD and cybersecurity. WELL is a unique company with both patient services and technology capabilities. We owe significant intellectual property, which drives our industry-leading solutions and has created compelling and relevant links within health care providers all over the country. We have created a best-in-class digital platform with significant IP that we call the practitioner enablement platform.\nThis platform aims to digitize, modernize and support providers and their clinics. With well over 23,000 medical providers in Canada that are leveraging the platform in some way. What is unique about WELL is that we are the biggest users of our own platform as the vast majority of our revenue is derived by our own patient services businesses. This is because we found that the best way to support providers is to help them run their businesses. When a provider joins WELL, we provide a fully managed solution. This means we look after all aspects of their business from front office, patient management to the management of all staff and back-office execution so they can focus on providing care.\nWe are industry leaders in technology and innovation in digital health care in Canada. Some of our examples of leadership include: one, we're one of the top 3 practice management service providers in Canada, including EMR, or electronic medical records software; two, we're one of the leading providers of digital patient engagement services, which includes all aspects of connecting patients and doctors digitally; three, we're one of the largest providers, in fact, the largest provider of revenue cycle management and outsourced billing services for doctors in Canada; five, (sic) [four,] we are the largest provider of e-referral software services in Canada. And we operate the Canada's only app marketplace for integrated EMR apps called apps.health.\nOur outlook looks promising for our SaaS and technology group. OceanMD, in particular, is emerging as a leader in patient engagement at e-referral solutions in the country. Already, the e-referral solution provided by Ocean is in place in the province of Ontario. We feel OceanMD has the potential to become the e-referral standard across the country. Ocean's platform is used at over 2,700 clinics in the country by over 25,000 clinicians with more than 1 million monthly patient users. It is emerging as one of the most important digital gateways for health care in Canada with connectivity to more than 30 integrated solutions in EMRs and provincial assets. To our knowledge, there's no other software or digital health system in Canada that is as deeply connected and embedded in the Canadian health care landscape as Ocean.\nWe have recently updated Ocean's web presence and invite you to spend some time learning about this amazing network. You can visit the site at oceanmd.com. I'm also pleased to report that as a company with deep tech experience and capabilities, we have made artificial intelligence a key priority within the company and are working on compelling new products and enhancements to roll out to our provider network. Our teams and partners are integrating different forms of AI technology, including generative AI solutions such as ChatGPT. We look forward to unveiling these solutions in the coming weeks and months ahead.\nIn summary, we're very pleased with our financial performance in 2022 and look forward to delivering the strongest results yet as a company. Our outlook for 2023 remains very positive. Hence, I can confidently provide annual guidance for revenues between $665 million and $685 million for this year, and a material improvement in our adjusted EBITDA to exceed at least $115 million.\nFinally, I'd like to thank you all for joining us on this call today and thank our shareholders and investors for their continued support. The capital markets have been very supportive of our vision and have provided us with the funding and patients needed to pursue our goals. I'd also like to thank WELL's senior management team, our employees and contractors, and in particular, our network and team of health care practitioners and other frontline workers who provide unbelievable patient care every single day. They remind us every day why we're here and we're here to support them. Thank you very much.\nAnd with that, we're very pleased to take some questions. Operator, could you please assist?"

First Quarter 2024 Financial Results Conference Call. My name is Sylvie, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions]. Please note that this conference is being recorded.\nI will now turn the call over to Tyler Baba, Manager, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nTyler Baba\n\nManager of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, operator, and welcome, everyone, to WELL Health Fiscal First Quarter 2024 Financial Results Conference Call for the 3 months ended March 31, 2024. Joining me on the call today are Hamed Shahbazi, Chairman and CEO; and Eva Fong, the company's CFO. I trust that everyone has received a copy of our financial results press release that was issued earlier today.\nPortions of today's call other than historical performance, include statements of forward-looking information within the meaning of applicable securities laws, including future-oriented financial information and financial outlook information. These forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks uncertainties, assumptions and other factors, many of which are outside of well's control that may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of WELL to differ materially from the anticipated results, performance or achievements implied by such forward-looking statements.\nThese factors are further outlined in today's press release and in our management's discussion and analysis. We provide forward-looking statements solely for the purpose of providing information about management's current expectations and plans relating to the future. We do not undertake or accept any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements to reflect any change in our expectations or any change in events, conditions, assumptions or circumstances on which any such statement is based, except if it is required by law.\nWe may use terms such as adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross margin, adjusted EBITDA, shareholder EBITDA, adjusted net income, adjusted net income per share and adjusted free cash flow on this conference call, all of which are non-GAAP and non-IFRS measures. For more information on how we define these terms, please refer to the definition set out in today's press release and in our management discussion and analysis.\nThe company believes that adjusted EBITDA is a meaningful financial metric as it measures cash generated from operations, which the company can use to fund working capital requirements, service future interest and principal debt repayments and fund future growth initiatives. Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an alternative to net income or loss determined in accordance with IFRS.\nAnd with that, let me turn the call over to Mr. Hamed Shahbazi, Chairman and CEO.\n\nHamed Shahbazi\n\nFounder, Chairman & CEO\n\nThank you, Tyler, and good day, everyone. We appreciate everyone for joining us today. We're extremely pleased to be with you and discuss Q1 2024, a quarter in which we achieved our 21st consecutive record-breaking revenue. We're also pleased to note another record this was a record-breaking net profit performance in any Q1 period in terms of IFRS net income as well as adjusted net income.\nAs the first conference call for fiscal 2024, we believe this is an important opportunity to update our guidance for revenue and EBITDA while rolling out brand new guidance for free cash flow generation and provide commentary around our improving cash flow per share metrics, demonstrating the strength of our platform and the momentum of our business. The first quarter of 2024 exceeded all expectations, and we're proud to report that we've begun the year with an intense focus on enhanced profitability and capital efficiency and are happy to report an 11% year-over-year shareholders per share metric. I will speak more to this later as it is thematically very important to today's call.\nYou see, we believe we reached an inflection point in the history of the company, where due to the hard work and dedication of our team members and care providers and especially due to our hard work in Q1 2024, where we reduced the significant amount of costs. We can now reduce our share issuances significantly and instead leverage our own cash flow to grow our business, as well as attract and retain the best and brightest people. You may have noticed that we recently started using our stock buyback or normal course issuer bid.\nWhile the number of shares we're buying on a daily basis are not very material as compared to our overall float at roughly $10,000 per day, we want to make sure shareholders understand that this is the beginning of a sustained and purposeful pattern that speaks to optimizing our share structure and reducing share issuances of all kinds, including stock-based compensation, while growing and optimizing our free cash flow available to shareholders. This year, we're absolutely determined to deliver our best cash flow generation performance of our history as well as the lowest amount of dilution since I started the company just over 6 years ago.\nWhile our optimism does stem from a lot of hard work on cost reduction and improved integration, it does also come from sustained and elevated organic growth. We're pleased to report that we achieved organic growth of 13.5% year-over-year with approximately 3.5% contribution from absorptions. As such, you will see over time that our stock buyback is symbolically and thematically very important as it ushers in a new period that we expect to be the norm, a period where that would be characterized by sustained growth in cash flow and improvements in reducing and then reversing dilution.\nBefore I get into the financials, I will first review some key operational metrics. At the end of Q1 2024, 3,900 well providers and clinicians were delivering care across our physical and virtual clinics. [Audio Gap] [ 6,000 ] providers benefiting from our SaaS and technology services that is more than 1/3 of all providers in the country, which we believe will continue to increase materially over time. WELL achieved a record 1.3 million patient visits in Q1 2024, an increase of 34% as compared to the previous year and representing 5.2 million patient visits on an annualized run rate basis. Canadian visits grew by 45%, while U.S. visits grew by 23%. Meanwhile, total patient interactions increased to a total -- to a record 2 million interactions in Q1, an increase of 43% as compared to the previous year.\nTurning to our guidance for 2024 due to the strength that we're seeing we're pleased to increase our annual revenue guidance to between $960 million and $980 million. This increase in guidance reflects the recently absorbed 10 new clinics from Shoppers Drug Mart. We're also improving our annual adjusted EBITDA guidance to be in the upper range of the $125 million to $130 million range we provided last quarter.\nIn support of our operating plan for 2024, we have strategically implemented comprehensive cost-cutting measures, including a streamlined approach to staff restructuring increased utilization of AI and technology for process improvement and optimization, consolidation of suppliers and tighter integration of our business units. These initiatives have not only strengthened our operational efficiency, but resulted in millions of dollars of annualized cost savings, which really permit us to continue our strong growth and limit our dilution. In addition, we're providing new additional guidance for improving free cash flow available to shareholders to over $55 million in 2024, which would reflect an increase of 30% from $42.4 million in 2023. Eva will provide some additional color on this later in the call.\nBut before I turn the call over to her, I'd like to highlight some key themes. One, the strategic alterative process for our U.S. digital health app, our clinic absorption model in Canada; and three, the success of our clinic transformation program. Let's first talk about the strategic alternatives for Circle and Wisp. Last quarter, we indicated that we've begun considering strategic alternatives for Circle and Wisp. We're pleased to report that we've hired 2 different global banks as advisers for each of Circle Medical and Wisp to help us with this process, and we believe that we should have important updates on this by the end of the year.\nYou may be asking why are we seeking strategic alternatives for 2 successful high-growth businesses. Our primary reason is that WELL has a call option for both of these businesses, which provides us with several alternatives, including acquiring the remaining ownership of the businesses, seeking [Audio Gap] for both businesses extend to and conclude in the Q4 time frame of this year. The second reason for seeking strategic alternatives is that mining a fair value for these 2 assets. Both Circle and Wisp are high-growth businesses that are operating at lower EBITDA operating margins than the rest of WELL due to their maturity, while investors today are primarily valuing the entire WELL business as a multiple of EBITDA. Hence, both Circle and Wisp are essentially hidden within the larger well company valuation. We believe that unlocking the value of water, both of these assets could result in a significant cash benefit to WELL shareholder which we will use to reduce our debt, issue a special buyback and/or allocate funds into new funds producing businesses in the Canadian market, where we have a greater synergy potential given our market leadership. As such, we believe this could be -- prove to be a positive catalyst for WELL and returning value to WELL shareholders.\nI want to reiterate that we are very pleased with the success of both [indiscernible]. Recall, when we announced our agreement to acquire a majority position in Circle in September of 2022. It was at an approximately $5 million revenue run rate in U.S. dollars and this year Circle is expected to achieve approximately USD 100 million in revenues. Meanwhile, Wisp had an approximately $30 million revenue run rate, when we acquired a majority stake in the company and this year is expected to achieve around USD 76 million in revenues or approximately CAD 100 million, demonstrating unquestionable value creation through our capital allocation strategy and execution.\nFor the second theme, I'll provide an update on our clinic absorption and acquisition program in Canada. While current pipeline of new clinic opportunities consists of almost 40 clinics under an LOI agreement, of which 10 of these clinics would be actionable under our clinic absorption model, where we absorb clinics into the WELL network and the remaining 30 clinics would be under our regular M&A bolt-on program. Under the clinic absorption model, we are acquiring clinics for nominal cash costs in the range of less than 0.02x revenue multiple compared to our regular M&A program where we may pay up to 0.5x revenue multiple or in the range of 3x to 5x EBITDA.\nThe clinic obstruction model is a very unique opportunity for WELL. Under this absorption model we take over the lease and the staff of the clinic and the doctors join our network. There's minimal upfront capital costs in most of these cases, but there can be some relatively minor costs to secure data protection and improve IT. We're able to absorb these clinics for nominal purchase consideration because the doctors are facing such significant technology challenges, administrative burdens that -- they don't want to run their own clinics and just want to focus on providing care. We believe the consolidation and digitization of over 20,000 primary care diagnostic allied health and longevity clinics across Canada is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity with over 15 clinics operating in 97 facilities across Canada, WELL is the clear market share leader. Yet we just represent just shy of 1% market share of the $35 billion market opportunity physician spending, which is a key component of the $330 billion spent every year in all health care costs across Canada. We believe that the Canadian market continues to be an enormous untapped opportunity for [Audio Gap]. We have conviction that we can grow our Canadian business to multiples of its current size in the near future.\nThe third theme is the success of our clinic digitization and transformation program. When we acquire or absorb primary care clinics, they're typically operating at 1% to 3% EBITDA margins. The large Manitoba clinic and the MCI Ontario clinics that we acquired in Q4 were actually operating at a negative EBITDA margin. [Audio Gap] billing improvements as well as our AI suite of products, which are unmatched by any market participants. Our goal is to get these clinics to operating in the 5% to 10% EBITDA margin range within the first year and to over 10% margins within 18 to 24 months. This is not easy. [Audio Gap]. The original cohort of 18 clinics in BC that we acquired from Dr. Franco in 2018 is now operating at over 13% EBITDA margins. Comparatively, the cohort that we acquired in 2022 achieved over 10% EBITDA margins within 18 months and are now operating at over 12% EBITDA margins.\nWe are now very closely watching absorptions and acquisitions. Included in the 2023 cohort is the large Manitoba clinic and NCI Ontario Clinic. These clinics were not profitable and caused downward pressure on our EBITDA margins in Q4. I'm pleased to announce that the digitization and transformation efforts at these clinics is running ahead of plan. And as of today, both Manitoba and MCI Ontario are now running at positive adjusted EBITDA. Going forward, we expect to continue to increase adjusted EBITDA margins at these clinics over the next year.\nAnd with that, I'd like to turn the call over to our CFO, Eva Fong, who will provide some financial context I'll then come back and provide further commentary on our business units and outlook. Eva?\n\nEva Fong\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, Hamed. I'm pleased to report that we had very strong results for the 3 months ended March 31, 2024. I won't go into details of the financials as they are available on SEDAR+ and on our press release this morning. Instead, I'll touch on our new disclosure in the financial statement and MD&A and our plan to issue less shares this year. First, on our new financial disclosures. At the beginning of this year, we solicited feedback from analysts, shareholders and capital market advisers on how we can improve our financial reporting disclosures.\nBased on this feedback, this quarter, we have included adjusted EBITDA in our segment note in the financial statements. Also in our MD&A [Audio Gap] segmented adjusted gross profit and adjusted EBITDA for all our business units. We believe this will help investors better track margin developments around each line of business and determined that our margin changes as of the last year are more as a result of the blend with new M&A rather than a secular change in any of our margins.\nNow on our plan to issue less shares this year. Last quarter, we indicated that we have a preference for preserving cash rather than issuing shares. We wanted to revisit this and advise that as Hamed noted earlier, we believe we have generally reached a fairly significant inflection point in how we [Audio Gap] given the continued growth of our business as well as the successful cost optimization program, we started executing on in Q1, we will be favoring paying cash over share issuance for M&A purposes as well as looking to materially reduce our share-based compensation moving forward.\nWorld experienced about a 10% share dilution in 2022 as a result of share issuance for all equity issuance, including share incentives for employees earn-out payments, acquisitions and equity financing. Comparatively, our total share dilution declined to 4% in 2023 and we are expecting to reduce this by double-digit percentage in 2024. This is before consideration of our normal course issuer bid or NCIB buybacks which may be increased over time depending on any significant improvements to our cash flows and/or if we were to successfully unlock the value from 1 or more of our U.S. digital assets.\nAs of May 7, we have bought back 75,300 shares under NCIB. We are also switching our employee incentive programs to be more cash-based versus share based which we expect will result in a significant reduction in new share incentive grants in 2024 as compared to 2023. This again will result in a corresponding decrease in stock-based compensation expense this year compared to last year.\nIn terms of our earn-out commitment, in 2023, we settled approximately $29.4 million in earn-outs and vendor take backs, which was a 55% decline from $65.2 million in earn-out and vendor take backs resettled in the prior year 2022. Looking forward in 2024, our current expectation is that earn-out payments will further decline by another 20% to approximately $23 million. In addition, this reduction in earnout payments will have a favorable impact on [Audio Gap] that is issued on a earnout payments.\nIt is also important to note that as of the end of Q1, we've already paid down the vast majority of our earn-outs for the year and are not planning significant share issuance for earn-out payments in the balance of the year. So with improving revenue, EBITDA and cash flow and while reducing our share issuance, this should result in an improvement in our per share metrics.\nLooking at our balance sheet at the end of Q1 2024, while ended Q1 2024 with a solid balance sheet. As of March 31, 2024, WELL had cash and cash equivalents of [Audio Gap] ending and fully compliant with all covenants related with this 2 credit lines, JPMorgan in the U.S. and World Bank in Canada. The debt from the 2 credit lines was approximately CAD 303 million as of March 31, 2024. Gross net debt to shareholder ratio for the 2 credit lines was 2.75x as at the end of Q1 2024, in line with 2.69x as at the end of Q4 2023. On a constant currency basis, the net debt to shareholder ratio actually remained unchanged compared to Q4 2023 at 2.69x.\nWe define net debt to shareholder EBITDA ratio as net debt, less cash on hand divided by adjusted EBITDA attributable to WELL shareholders. We exclude convertible debentures from this calculation because convertible debentures are not included in our bank covenants. If we include our convertible debentures, which mature at the end of 2026, we will be at approximately 3.51x levered. In terms of our share capitalization, as of May 7, 2024, WELL have 263,875,048 fully diluted securities issued and outstanding.\nThat is my financial update, and I turn the call back over to Hamed.\n\nHamed Shahbazi\n\nFounder, Chairman & CEO\n\nThank you, Eva. Before I get into the individual business units, I wanted to elaborate on Eva's comments about reducing our share dilution. This is what I refer to as the fourth and most important key theme for today's call, our commitment to delivering improved shareholder value. The best expression for this commitment is closely looking at and tracking our per share metrics. While our revenue per share and EBITDA per share metrics have generally been favorable as a capital allocation company, we're quite focused on our cash flow per share available to shareholders. This metric is the gold standard in terms of delivering and exemplifying shareholder value.\nWe're pleased to report that in Q1 2024, we've increased cash flow per share available to shareholders more than a 10% increase from the same period last year. This shows that while we have experienced some increases in share count, we've managed to grow our cash flow to overcompensate for this. Moving forward, given that we have improved our cost efficiency in Q1 and are working to further reduce our dilution, we expect cash flow per share figures to increase materially throughout the year. In fact, we expect notable percentage increases in the next 3 quarters and more significant increases each year moving forward.\nSimply put, we've reached an exciting inflection point with the company where our earnouts are decreasing, our cash flows are increasing and our share issuances are dramatically decreasing and eventually reversing. This has the effect of substantially improving shareholder value contributing improved cash flow per share metrics.\nI might add that above dynamic that we just discussed about will be true irrespective of the interest rate environment. If rates start coming down, this will have the effect of increasing our cash flow even more, which will improve these figures. It also doesn't assume any progress or specific outcomes with respect to our strategic alternatives initiatives that we discussed earlier in the call. If any of those initiatives results in liquidity for the company, our cash flow would improve as we would likely significantly reduced our interest costs by paying down more debt and buying more stock.\nIn the past, we had a strategy [Audio Gap] acquisition and structuring our deals and earnouts with the help of share issuances, but now that WELL's cash flows have improved, organic growth has sustainably increased and the company has matured, we are in a phase of the company where we have a preference for using cash, then shares for acquisitions, earnouts and employee incentive programs. Of course, that preference is also partially readed to our own stock price. And at the moment, we feel that we are deeply undervalued given our operational performance as compared to our peers.\nI will now provide some specific commentary on our individual business units. First, our Canadian Patient Services business. which is now overseen by Dr. Michael Frankel, our Chief Medical Officer. This division includes our primary care business and our wealth diagnostic centers previously referred to as MyHealth. WELL owns and operates the largest network of clinics across Canada with physical facilities in the 5 most popular provinces of Canada, namely Ontario, Quebec, BC, Alberta and Manitoba providing multiple services, including primary care, diagnostic Allied Health, Specialty Care and longevity medical services. Performance of our Canadian patient services business has been exceptionally strong, generating $75.7 million in revenue in Q1, an increase of 49% from the previous year and is ahead of our previous guidance of achieving $300 million [ by ] 2024, which had already reflected a 30% increase over 2023.\nCanadian Patient Services generated adjusted EBITDA of $11.3 million for the quarter, representing 15% EBITDA margin and from Q1 of last year. In addition, EBITDA generated in Canada primarily goes to shareholder EBITDA given the small noncontrolled interest that we have in the Canadian market. Let's look a bit closer at the primary care segment. Our primary care business unit includes family practice, walk-in clinics, virtual care, allied health and longevity services. The company's primary care business unit [Audio Gap] of 83% as compared to the same period last year. This increase relates primarily to the acquisitions of MCI Ontario and Alberta-based medical clinics and the large Manitoba clinic as well as strong organic growth of 35% and which includes same clinic growth as well as impact from our clinic absorption program.\nOur outlook for primary care continues to look strong for the second quarter and beyond, notwithstanding the transformation and digital work that we will be doing on the acquired Shoppers Drug Mart clinics, which will have a planned and temporary negative impact on our P&L. As we go through the process of digitizing and modernizing these clinics, we expect them to be profitable in 2024. Our longevity business has had a great start since announcing this in Q4 of last year. We've already generated close to $1 billion in new higher-margin revenues in Q1 2024 as compared to $6.6 million in Q1 2023. And while this is a young program, we believe we've created a truly special and scientifically relevant program that is helping patients with their preventative health goals.\nAnd now for a few words about WELL Health diagnostic centers. WELL Health Diagnostics had a very strong Q1, achieving record number of patient visits and record revenue of $30.4 million, an increase of 17% on compared to the same period last year. It is performed by organic growth from the expansion of services and a number of health care providers, which allows us to serve more patients. Q1 was also boosted by some onetime positive reimbursement, which won't be repeated in Q2. For 2024, we're expecting our WELL Health diagnostic centers to achieve another year of record revenue and EBITDA. We anticipate expanding cardiology services in Q2 to address the growing demand while recruiting more physicians. This will allow for increased demand for cardiology consultations and diagnostic services.\nAnd in terms of M&A, we're now seeing acquisition multiples finally start to moderate in this segment and become more reasonable on specialized care and diagnostic M&A opportunities. We're looking forward to expanding our diagnostic centers to more provinces in 2024 and beyond.\nAnd now I'll discuss the outlook for our WELL Health USA business. First, CRH and provider staffing. CRH Medical entered 2024 and the first quarter after fully integrating its 2023 midyear acquisition of CarePlus management, which included radar provider staffing business. As a reminder, provider staffing is a premier and trusted staffing and locum tenens business, specializing in anesthesia. It provides recruitment and placement services along with temporary staffing, its national network of provider groups, hospitals and ASCs across the lower 48 states. This business is extremely complementary to CRH's legacy anesthesia business and provides high revenue growth along with many operating [indiscernible]. We expect growth of this segment to continue with anesthesia as well as plans to expand to other health care specialties.\nQ1 is typically CRH's weakest seasonal quarter in both revenue and margins due to health insurance and payer mix shifts, along with the renewal of patient deductibles coinciding with year-end. With that in mind, Q1 revenue for the CRH business unit, which includes both anesthesia and [indiscernible] banding was still up 7.4% year-over-year. Also, last year's Q1 included some onetime revenue, which was not repeated this year. We're expecting Q2 revenue to be in line with Q1 levels for both CRH and provider staffing with growth and profitability accelerating into the second half of 2024 as expected.\nAnd now on to Circle Medical. In Q1, Circle Medical saw continued growth in patient visits, an impressive uptick of 32% year-over-year with patient volumes growing from 133,000 to 175,000. Concurrently, revenues surged to $28.7 million in Q1, an increase of 24% as compared to the same period last year. For Q2, we expect another record revenue quarter with positive adjusted EBITDA. We reiterate our previous guidance of Circle expecting [Audio Gap] with improved margins as compared to last year. Some highlights about the Circle Medical business.\nDuring Q1, Circle launched virtual care in 8 new states, bringing their total number of active states of 38. Also Circle's pioneering AI scribe product developed in-house is currently undergoing beta testing with 15 providers and is anticipated to broaden its reach. The platform is slated to deploy to this product to 100 providers in the summer promising enhanced accuracy in medical documentation and time savings for providers. Circle has a compelling AI-inspired product development pipeline, and we look forward to updating shareholders as more products and features are released.\nAnd now a bit of focus on Wisp. I'm pleased to report that Wisp reported adjusted EBITDA in Q1 2024 with revenue of $21.1 million and an increase of 13% from Q1 2023. More importantly, with improved its profitability with adjusted EBITDA increasing 213% as compared to Q1 last year. For Q2, we expect Wisp to see continued growth as the business ramps up marketing spend and continue to lean in on new product development with plans to launch its fertility vertical in June as well as new membership program. With increase in Q2, we expect adjusted EBITDA levels in will decline in Q2 from the level in Q1.\nFinally, our SaaS and technology services business. Our SaaS and technology business units experienced a revenue decline of approximately 20% in Q1 as compared to last year. This was almost entirely driven by less onetime software project revenue in our cyber security division, which tends to be fairly lumpy. However, despite the sale of InterHealth on February 1, 2024, recurring or highly reoccurring external revenue across the SaaS and Technology Services business unit increased by 13% to $11.9 million, strong organic growth in our platform businesses, including Ocean MD.\nDuring Q3 2023, we announced that Ocean MD signed a $38.5 million contract with the province of BC. We've already received onetime consulting and project revenue under this contract and we expect to go live with e-referrals in BC in the coming weeks, at which time we'll also begin to receive recurring subscription revenue. In addition, I'm pleased to know that Ocean MD is in the final stage negotiation with another Canadian [indiscernible] referral solution. Ocean MD is the dominant e-referral solution in Canada and is becoming recognized as the e-referral standard across the country.\nAnd now a little bit about our AI products. In 2023, we introduced well AI voice in AI in box administration and AI decision support. I'll start with AI decision support or wait as some people are starting to call it. This is our physician copilot that compliantly screens patient data and provides physicians with risk stratification and other actionable insights. By risk stratification is what we mean, is that it will segment by disease patients in a physician roster that are high, medium or low risk for a particular disease. This makes it very easy for physicians to scan and determine if there are any patients that are misdiagnosed underdiagnosed were completely undiagnosed for a particular disease, which is pretty incredible support for a physician.\nOur first-generation system was focused more on rare diseases. But with the second-generation version, we now have broadening out support to chronic diseases such as hypertension, chronic kidney disease and diabetes, both in the U.S. and Canada, more than half of all adults reported having one or more chronic diseases. Chronic diseases are the leading causes of risk and disability in both the U.S. and Canada. They're also the leading driver of health care costs. So adding chronic diseases is a game changer for well AI decision support. This is a very special co-pilot program, which is the leading product of its kind in Canada [Audio Gap]. It is powered by our investee and partner HEALWELL AI. More on HEALWELL later.\nWELL AI voice -- a little bit about WELL AI voice now. We discussed this product before. It is a leading medical transcribing product which significantly reduces administrative burden and enhances patient engagement, giving physicians valuable time back in their day. The strong adoption of WELL AI voice underscores its immense value to health care practitioners. having seamlessly integrated into over 131,000 patient consultations in 2023 and substantially enriching the quality of patient care. The 4 months into 2024, and we've already exceeded the entire previous year's volume of encounters with nearly 200,000 documented patient consultations. This growth represents savings of over 10,000 hours for physicians, highlighting our commitment to enhancing physician efficiency and patient care through our advanced AI capabilities.\nWELL AI voice is now operational in over pretty well clinics across Ontario and B.C. and plans for expansion into Alberta sum. This strategic rod is set to further our mission of supporting wealth physicians and extending our network's reach.\nAnd now a bit about WELL AI in Box administration. WELL AI and Box administration significantly reduces clinic administrative burden in facts and document handling. WELL AI Inbox is currently active in 117 clinics and processing over 40,000 faxes monthly. In Q1, WELL AI Inbox introduced full fax automation using AI technology, the application can now automatically file incoming fax documents directly into the patient chart and provider Inbox without any staff input. Based on an initial pilot, up to 50% of documents can be fully triage and assigned for provider review in the EMR, saving clinic admins up to 90% of their time. Overall, our technology platform services group continues to perform with the rollout of AI-based tools, expansion of Ocean referral solution and the continued execution by our EMR and billing solutions groups.\nI'd like to provide some additional commentary now on HEALWELL AI in our partnership. We've been very pleased with the performance of HEALWELL AI. Since it's debut launch on October 1, 2023, WELL has completed -- HEALWELL has completed 3 financings for a total of $29.9 million in convertible debt and equity and just launched what looks like will end up being a $20 million bought deal which will all together total approximately $50 million raised since October, just 7 months ago. HEALWELL has already, during this period of time, completed 2 acquisitions of intra-health and pentamer and made a minority investment in Dr. Lee. HEALWELL is currently on a $20 million revenue run rate, which is expected to more than double in the coming months with additional organic and organic growth based on what they've noted publicly.\nWELL currently owns 18% of the common shares of HEALWELL on a fully diluted basis, taking into consideration our convertible notes and warrants, WELL's ownership is approximately 27%. WELL also has a call option on 30 million multi-voting shares, which will provide WELL with over 40% of economic ownership and 72% of Class B voting shares [Audio Gap]. In summary, we're pleased to have this opportunity to showcase some of our latest thinking on the business including the inflection point we discussed earlier on how we think about our preference for cash usage versus share issuances. We're very focused on improving our free cash flow per share metric and believe that this metric will continue to demonstrate significant improvements throughout the year and beyond.\nOur outlook remains positive, [indiscernible] confident in upgrading our annual guidance and introducing new guidance for the first time on free cash flow generated to more than $55 million for the year. We hope the improvements in disclosure in this call and in our MD&A demonstrates that we're really committed to meeting the requirements of the analyst and investor community. If there's something that you believe is missing, please don't hesitate to reach out to your well Investor Relations team.\nBefore closing, I want to share some important updates with you. WELL Health is hosting its Annual General Meeting on June 12. This is a virtual AGM, and details can be found in our information circular, which will be filed on SEDAR in the coming weeks. We're also hosting an in-person Investor Day on June 18 at the Toronto Hilton Hotel. Details can be found under the Events section of our website.\nFinally, I'd like to thank you all for joining us on this call today and thank our shareholders and investors for continued support. The capital markets have been very supportive of our vision and have provided us that the funding needed to pursue our goals and we are working hard to return the favor and drive exceptional shareholder value. I'd also like to thank Wells senior management team, all our employees and contractors for their tremendous effort, and in particular, I'd like to thank our team of talented health care practitioners and frontline workers who provide unbelievable patient care.\nAnd with that, we'd like to open the call for questions. Operator, would you please accommodate?"

Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) It is now my pleasure to introduce General Counsel, Matt McQueen.\n\nMatthew Grant McQueen\n\nExecutive VP, General Counsel & Corporate Secretary, Welltower Inc.\n\nThank you, and good morning. As a reminder, certain statements made during this call may be deemed forward-looking statements in the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act.\nAlthough Welltower believes any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, the company can give no assurance that best projected results will be attained. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in the company's filings with the SEC.\nAnd with that, I'll hand the call over to Shankh for his remarks.\n\nShankh S. Mitra\n\nCEO, CIO & Director, Welltower Inc.\n\nThank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. I'll describe our capital allocation priorities in the rapidly evolving investment environment and review high-level business trends before handing the call over to John, who will detail operational trends. .\nA little over 1 year ago, our seniors housing operating business witnessed a powerful inflection point with occupancy gains and pricing power sustained through the remainder of the year despite Delta and Omicron variants.\nThis momentum continued into first quarter of this year and translated into the first period of year-over-year bottom line growth for our company since the beginning of pandemic. Our total portfolio revenue is up 32.7% year-over-year, driven by both organic revenue growth as well as a significant volume of high conviction capital deployment during the last 18 months.\nOn a same-store basis, our Senior Housing Operating portfolio revenue is up 11.2% year-over-year. driven by a 4.6% occupancy growth and 4.6% rate growth. Encouragingly, we saw sequential pricing growth was 4.3%, the fastest growth recorded in our history despite only half of our operators pushing through in-house rent increases on Jan 1 schedule.\nAll of these translated into 18.4% same-store NOI growth in Q1, an impressive number that surpassed our expectations. We're all very encouraged by the speed at which pre-trades are moving up. And we expect same-store NOI growth will accelerate into the second half of the year, barring another COVID spike.\nAll of this setting up to be a powerful earnings recovery that we anticipate in 2023 and beyond. Before I turn into investment environment, I want to make 2 things here that are very important for multiyear earnings growth path. Number one, in 2018, when we converted our Brandywine Senior Living lease to RIDEA, I mentioned there are 2 other portfolio we had in triple-net structure that we hope to convert.\nOne of them was Legend Senior Living. After many years of discussion with Tim Buchanan, Legend's legendary founder and CEO, I'm pleased to report that we have converted this relationship into RIDEA. Recall that we had an 88% and 20% propco JV between Welltower and Legend.\nAt conversion, Tim contributed a portion of his propco, 5 brand-new assets and has agreed to a future development agreement to create a powerful 93%, 7% equity partnership going forward. Finally, after years of persuasion, we have convinced him that we can grow the pie using our data analytics platform so significantly that he will still be better off despite owning a smaller portion of the pie.\nA partner of our company since '90s, Legend has paid every single dollar of rent that was owed to Welltower regardless of their coverage on a given day. Though these deals is dilutive to our FFO in 2022 due to significant agency leverages today, we expect cash flow relative to the previous rent will breakeven in beginning of 2023, and our shareholders will enjoy upside from there on.\nWe hope for extraordinary partnership over last week -- had extraordinary partnership over the last 3 decades, and we hope that it will continue for many more to come. This transition, along with acquisition and future development partnership exemplifies our sole focus on enhancing long-term value of the portfolio and is indicative of the potential earnings upside in the portfolio that can be captured through a simple cap rate or multiple valuation methodology.\nNumber two, historically, our SHO business focused on managing managers and assets. Now that we have significantly upgraded our operational capabilities, including through the hiring of John Burkart, our COO, our focus in the SHO business will mirror the real estate and management services that we provide in our medical office business or what an apartment rig does with an understanding that we're limited in providing care services in a health -- qualified health care property.\nThis fundamental shift in our approach has a profound impact on how we think about our role in the operating stack. This is particularly important as we think through the most important part of that operating platform, which is the technology stack. John will get into the details as part of his script, but we are delighted that he is in full scale development and implementation of a true operating platform at Welltower.\nJohn is working closely with some of our best operating partners to launch this, call it RIDEA 4.0 for now, but honestly, that doesn't do our new approach justice, as to the scale and impact, we think his plans will have on the customer experience and value creation overall. Needless to say, we expect this multiyear initiative will have a tremendous impact on our earnings growth trajectory and long-term compounding machine that we are setting up at Welltower.\nNow let's talk about capital allocation. As you know, my team is extraordinarily focused on allocating capital to create part share value for existing shareholders. The keyword is existing. We'll favor our existing shareholders who have been our partners through thick and thin, especially through thin. We are fiercely protective of their interest on a per share basis, and won't act in a manner that does not create significant value for them.\nBecause we're extremely transparent and genuinely dislike drama, I will mention to you that Welltower is the party F referenced in the HTA HR merger proxy a couple of weeks ago. Every week, we call owners of assets and express our interest to buy them at a price. This was no different.\nI am genuinely disappointed that HR Board and management did not engage with us, but that is their prerogative. It is completely up to their shareholders and the Board, which presents those shareholders to decide how to maximize value. Because of the many rumors circulating and the reports and articles about this, I'll mention a few things before moving on to much more important items.\nNumber one, we're fair win-win people, we offer to buy the company on public information at $31.75 per share, plus a breakup fee of $163 million from a merger which as you have seen, the market reported at significantly value destructive per analyst reports.\nWe believe that our cash offer provided better value to HR shareholders than the HTA merger, and it was fully financed and were prepared to move within days. I read research notes that described our unfair pricing relative to what might be quoted in market cap rate.\nPlease understand that we did not offer to buy an asset, we offer to buy a company that we are willing to pay for assets and pay a breakup fee that bails out company out for company's existing shareholders for potential dilution that well respected analyst community has been writing about.\nI hope this will stop mischaracterization of our offer and our intent. Number two, Welltower always has and always will honor its agreement with third parties, including that with HTA. In fact, HTA itself piloted our NDA with them by providing -- by first disclosing it to HR and then later to the public in the joint proxy.\nFurther our NDA with them does not contain a standstill that will apply us to making an offer for HR as a stand-alone entity. As you would expect, we signed it with HTA in order to access information regarding HTA and its properties, therefore, the Standstill only applies to HTA and its properties.\nOur proposal was expressly conditioned on HR not completing their HTA transaction. Number three, we have never chased the deal and never will. We buy everything at a price and sell everything at a price. Although I'm disappointed that HR did not engage with us, as our offer -- we thought our offer would result into a superior outcome for HR shareholders, I have no intention of being hostile.\nI personally like Todd, I called him and expressed our interest. We didn't buy shares in the public market, nor did we act in anything but a friendly way. They did not engage. Under these circumstances, we have nothing to do here.\nNumber four, contrary to what some analysts might have written, this deal would not have been dilutive to our senior housing growth. You don't know what proportion of equity, debt or joint ventures we might have contemplated for the transaction. But even if you think we were to do this entirely on the balance sheet, it would be a rather simple exercise.\nLook at the NOI bridge in our business update, divide that NOI by existing number of shares, calculate the additional shares required by the HR transaction to calculate dilution on a part share basis and then add back the accretion from the deal. You will see our existing shareholders would have covered ahead.\nWe look at every single investment through the lens of opportunity costs. Specifically, we have to satisfactorily answer three questions that Buffett has taught us. And then what, compared to what, at the expense of what. This is no different. And number five, we're not disappointed nor we are concerned about our growth of our senior housing business. While the contrary, in fact, we just reported 18.4% same-store NOI growth and expected to meaningfully accelerate in the second half of the year.\nNow that I have put all these rumors to bed, let's talk about the 30 or so owners who did engage with us to create win-win partnership transactions. Year-to-date, we have closed $1.2 billion of acquisitions across 21 different off-market or privately negotiated transactions. This is a remarkable stat given the torrid pace of activity last year.\nI find it difficult to talk about specific deals as it feels like picking your favorite children, but I still mention a handful of transactions to give you a sense. We bought 700 units, 3 large communities in Washington State with COGIR to expand our partnership with Matthew and Dave. Dave Eskenazy is one of the best in the business, and I'm glad that he's now back full time at COGIR US as a CEO.\nWe're also expanding our partnership with purchase of another property in Brentwood located in the East Bay of Northern California. All properties were bought at significant discount replacement cost. For example, the Brentwood asset contains large units, and it was bought for $320,000 per unit. We believe the replacement cost in each way today is easily significantly north of $500,000 units.\nAdditionally, we are significantly deepening our relationship with Dan and his team at StoryPoint with the acquisition of 33 communities in Michigan, Ohio and Tennessee in their backyard. With a median vintage of 2016, we're extremely pleased with the average price of $197,000 per unit which is meaningful discount replacement cost with 63% of current average occupancy this sizable deal will be dilutive to our 2022 FFO per share, but properties are anticipated to generate significant occupancy, margin and cash flow growth in 2023 and beyond under StoryPoint's enhanced operating platform.\nThis is another example of us choosing the right long-term investment decision and cash flow growth of our GAAP earnings separation, another thing you hear from us consistently.\nIn another transaction, we announced we're expanding our partnership with Courtney and her team at Oakmont with 7 new assets in extraordinary locations in California. Courtney and her team are at the absolute top of operating echelons, and we cannot be happier to grow this partnership together.\nSeparately, within the medical office space, we bought 4 building property portfolio on the campus of one of the strongest hospitals in Birmingham, Alabama for a 5.5% cap rate in an absolute net lease structure at a great basis. Given the absolute net structure, we expect unlevered IRR to be high single-digit range. We're also under contract to buy 2 large beautiful MOBs, 1 in San Francisco Bay Area, another in Sacramento MSA for a high 5% going-in cap rate at a great basis. Again, we expect to generate high single digits in IRR in both cases.\nIn terms of the financing market, in the last 30 days or so, we have seen a massive shift with property level leverage down 15 points, cost doubling and interest only disappearing from the market, both in seniors as well as in MOBs. This is starting to have a tectonic impact on asset pricing. To put bluntly, I have not been this excited about our acquisition prospects since Q4 of 2020.\nAbout 6 weeks ago, an investor, whom I respect very much asked me if I'm optimistic about the next $7 billion of acquisitions, as I was about the last $7 billion of acquisition that we did since pivoting to offense in 4Q of '20. I instinctively answered what I truly believe that we're driven by value, not by volume, which this investor took it as a no.\nToday, that answer will be unequivocal yes. Yes, we are excited about the figuratively net $7 billion as we are when we acted on the last $7 billion. To that effect, our pipeline today is roughly $1.5 billion of deals in process across 20 different off-market or privately negotiated transactions. Several of these are potentially operating unit transactions, which we expect to be very popular with the sellers.\nPlease recall that we define our pipeline as transactions that are already under contract. In addition to this, we're negotiating another couple of billion dollars of acquisitions across several other transactions. While we may not eventually succeed in convincing sellers to agree to our price, please note that we don't need any given transaction. Price is the price.\nWe see cracks in the market and are focused on where the puck is going and not where the puck might have been. The value of a party that never retreats and doesn't requires debt has really been higher. In most class systems in nature, such as coastline, cloud, turbulence no matter how much you scale up or scale down, you notice a remarkable self-similarity property. You notice that same occurrence everywhere in nature.\nFor example, a floret of a cauliflower is same as the cauliflower. This phenomenon is called fractal geometry. This is the same idea that our drive time polygons and isochrones are based on if you have seen our data science presentation. Interestingly, organization history is full of companies who grow successfully through small bolt-on acquisitions in their advantageous niche only to convince themselves of strategic acquisitions that get them in trouble.\nDavid Packer, the founder of HP brilliantly said, more businesses die of indigestion than starvation to discuss this phenomena. At Welltower, we don't have strategic acquisitions. In fact, self-similarity of mother nature is highly visible in our investment philosophy. No matter how small or big a specific investment is we are after the same, driven by the same factors.\nIn all cases, were buying, #1, a reasonable basis relative to replacement costs. And #2, where we can add value by driving operational improvement. We are not spread investing deal junkies. We are true total retail investors and are optimistic that 2022 will be one of the best years in the company's history from an acquisition point.\nWith that, I'll hand the call over to my partner, John Burkart, our Chief Operating Officer. John?\n\nJohn F. Burkart\n\nExecutive VP & COO, Welltower Inc.\n\nThank you, Shankh. My comments today will touch upon the performance of our operating business in the quarter and provide some elements of our vision for senior housing. Starting with our medical office portfolio.\nIn the first quarter, our outpatient medical business delivered 2.7% same-store NOI growth over the prior year's quarter, while occupancy declined modestly to 94.5%. We continue to see strong retention rates in the first quarter of 92%, likely driven by rising construction costs, construction delays and the related increases in new lease rents.\nGoing forward, we expect occupancy to decline modestly as we continue to increase renewal rates in line with market increases. Now turning to our senior housing portfolio. The coiled spring, as Shankh has called it, is starting its expansion. Revenue in our same-store portfolio grew at 11.2% in the first quarter compared to the prior year's quarter.\nThat's over 2x the growth rate experienced last quarter and the highest year-over-year increase since at least 2017. Our first quarter performance was led by our U.S. portfolio, which reported year-over-year top line growth of 13.5%. Additionally, as we've described in recent calls, pricing power continues to strengthen as reflected by strong renewal rate increases and improving market rate.\nIn fact, RevPAR growth in the first quarter increased by the highest level in years at 4.6% year-over-year and 4.3% sequentially. While expenses grew at a rate of 9.5%, the more insightful expense metric is expense POR or expense per occupied room, which only grew at a rate of 3%, in the first quarter year-over-year on a year-over-year basis, the lowest since at least 2017.\nThe combination of higher rental rates, increasing occupancy and improving margins led to an outstanding NOI growth rate of 18.4%. Our operators continue to report very strong demand with traffic above 2019 levels, which bodes well for the peak sales season ahead.\nAnd if things play out as we expect continued top line strength and further improvement on the expense side should result in a meaningful acceleration in NOI growth in the back half of the year. Understandably, since taking over as COO at Welltower, I've received questions about my vision and areas of focus, both of which I want to provide some insight to on this call.\nI will outline the opportunity I see and highlight some key elements of my plan, which I believe Welltower is uniquely positioned to execute. As I evaluate the senior housing business, my perspective is a little different than the conventional wisdom that is developed as the health care REIT industry has evolved.\nThe healthcare REIT industry, including Welltower, started with triple-net leases for senior housing, giving the owners little to no say in operations and asset management. As the industry evolved with RIDEA, the historic reliance on the operators to run the business continued. The senior housing industry was founded by strong visionary leaders who saw that there was a much better way for society to provide quality lifestyles for its aging members, and they acted accordingly, like so many industries, which are started by small businesses, they are specialists in their core focus, in this case, providing quality living experience for our aging population and generalists and the many other important elements related to running a modern operating business.\nBut as you know, I come to this business with a different perspective and have broken down the business into a few components. It's essentially the multifamily business that provides care with some hospitality. As Shankh alluded to in his opening remarks. Although REITs are limited in providing care services, we can perform multifamily type functions like revenue management, capital management, procurement, provide IT expertise as well as leverage our data science expertise.\nBy doing so, we have the opportunity to fundamentally change the potential of this business by creating a full-scale operating platform and bringing operational excellence to the senior housing business. Overall, I have come to believe that Welltower has a substantial opportunity to improve the customer and employee experience and create shareholder value through leading the digital transformation of the business.\nMore to come on timing, but I will say that we are actively working on the initiative, partnering with best-in-class operators, and we will deliver various components as they are ready. The addition of the world-class operating platform will continue to dramatically increase the size and depth of the Welltower moat, and it will greatly simplify the business for our top operators, enabling them to focus on their core strengths, increasing their effectiveness and efficiency, and driving increased total returns.\nWe expect that all our stakeholders, including our operating partners and investors will emerge as winners in this next phase of the senior housing business. I'll now turn the call over to Tim.\n\nTimothy G. McHugh\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Welltower Inc.\n\nThank you, John. My comments today will focus on our first quarter 2022 results. The performance of our triple-net investment segments in the quarter. Our capital activity, our balance sheet liquidity update; and finally, our outlook for the second quarter. Welltower reported fourth quarter net income attributable to common stockholders of $0.14 per diluted share and normalized funds from operations of $0.82 per diluted share, which was above the midpoint of our $0.79 to $0.84 per share guidance.\nDespite our results only including approximately $600,000 of HHS funds versus the $6 million expectation we had previously forecasted as part of our guidance. This quarter represented our first with year-over-year normalized FFO growth since the start of the pandemic. And when excluding provider relief funds received in the respective periods, our $0.82 per share represents 15% year-over-year growth versus the first quarter of 2021.\nWe are also pleased to report that total portfolio same-store NOI growth turned positive in the quarter. With 8.9% year-over-year growth, which compares favorably to guidance of 7%. Turning to our triple-net lease portfolios. As a reminder, our triple-net lease portfolio coverage and occupancy stats are reported at quarter in years. So these statistics reflect the trailing 12 months ending 12/31/2021.\nIn our seniors housing triple-net portfolio, same-store NOI increased 6.9% year-over-year and exceeded our expectations, driven by improvements in rent collections on leases currently in cash recognition and the early impact of rental increases tied to CPI.\nTrailing 12-month EBITDAR coverage was 0.82x and with a sequential improvement, mainly driven by the conversion of Legend Senior Living to day in the quarter. As indicated last quarter, we expect coverages to continue to move higher through the rest of the year as the positive inflection point we started experiencing in our SHO portfolio in the first quarter will be reflected in our triple-net coverages on a 1-quarter lag.\nNext, our long-term post-acute portfolio generated negative 1.8% year-over-year same-store NOI growth and trailing 12-month EBITDAR coverage was 1.3x. We completed $67 million of long-term post-acute sales in the quarter bringing our total sales in the last 12 months to $525 million and a blending cap rate of 7.5%, with an additional $202 million under contract for sale at quarter end.\nAs a result, our long-term post-acute portfolio represented just 4.8% of total in-place NOI at year-end versus 10.1% at the end of 2020, a 530 basis point decline driven largely by the exit of our Genesis relationship.\nAnd lastly, health systems, which is comprised of our ProMedica Senior Care joint venture with ProMedica Health System, had same-store NOI growth of positive 2.75% year-over-year and trailing 12-month EBITDAR coverage was 0.02x.\nAs a reminder, this lease is backed by the full corporate guarantee from ProMedica Health System. Turning to capital market activity. We continue to enhance our balance sheet strength and position the company to capitalize a robust and highly visible pipeline of capital deployment opportunities by utilizing our ATM program to efficiently fund those near-term transactions.\nSince the start of the year, we have sold 21 million shares via forward sale agreement, at initial weighted average price of approximately $89.90 per share for expected gross proceeds of $1.9 billion. We currently have approximately 19.5 million shares remaining unsettled, which are expected to generate future proceeds of $1.8 billion.\nAdditionally, we are seeing significant interest from potential sellers to accept OP units as consideration, providing further investment capacity. Taken together, our unsettled ATM proceeds, potential OP unit issuances and $352 million of expected property disposition and loan payoff proceeds provide ample capacity to fund our current investment pipeline.\nDuring the quarter, we issued our second green bond comprised of $550 million of 10-year unsecured debt maturing in 2032, with a coupon of 3.85%. Following a similar discipline in our equity funding strategy, this is our fourth unsecured issuance since March of 2021, bringing total debt issuance over the span of $2.3 billion with an average duration of 9.5 years and average coupon of 3%.\nAt quarter end, when factoring in cash and restricted cash balances, our liquidity position exceeded the $4 billion of borrowing capacity on our line of credit. And when combined with the previously mentioned $2.1 billion of unsettled ATM proceeds and expected disposition proceeds, we remain in a very strong liquidity position.\nLastly, moving to our second quarter outlook. Last night, we provided an outlook for the second quarter of net income attributable to common stockholders per diluted share of $0.20 to $0.25 per share, normalized FFO per diluted share of $0.82 to $0.87 per share or $0.845 at the midpoint. This guidance takes into consideration approximately $6 million of HHS funds expected to be received in the second quarter.\nGuidance represents a $0.025 increase at the midpoint from our $0.82 per share number in 1Q. This $0.025 increase is composed of a $0.04 sequential increase in our Senior Housing Operating portfolio NOI, $0.01 incremental increase in HHS funds and is offset by $0.025 of increased interest expense, lower foreign exchange rates, particularly the British pound, and dilution from development deliveries.\nUnderlying this FFO guidance is estimated in second quarter total portfolio year-over-year same-store growth of 8% to 10%, driven by subsegment growth of outpatient medical, 2% to 3%; long-term post-acute 2% to 3%; Health System, positive 2.75% and senior housing triple-net 7% to 8%. And finally, senior housing operating growth of 15% to 20%, driven by revenue growth of 11% and underlying this revenue growth is an expectation of approximately 500 basis points of year-over-year average occupancy increase and continued robust rate increases.\nWe continue to be pleased by the momentum of the top line recovery in our senior housing operating portfolio, driven by a combination of rate and occupancy growth. setting the stage for a multiyear recovery to average occupancy in the portfolio at 76.4% at quarter end, nearly 1,100 basis points below pre-COVID levels and nearly 1,500 basis points below peak occupancy levels.\nWe've described as recovery in the past as a coiled spring with both secular and cyclical tailwinds behind it. While we started to see the spring release in the core portfolio, we have made the conscious decision to steadily allocate capital to distressed, underoperated and often initially diluted properties, along with high-quality development projects.\nWhile this capital allocation has the effect of offsetting some of our core growth today, we will sustainably amplify it in the years to come. In short, we're working hard to keep that spring coil even as we start to realize the power of the earnings growth it can drive.\nAnd with that, I'll hand the call back over to Shankh.\n\nShankh S. Mitra\n\nCEO, CIO & Director, Welltower Inc.\n\nI want to sum it up -- sum up the call by saying I cannot be more pleased with the internal and external growth prospects of the company. We have taken a lot of shots, suffered a lot of pain through the course of many years to finally get to the point where we believe we're primed for long-term compounding.\nThe only way we know how to create significant shareholder wealth over a long period of time.\nA great investment has 3 characteristics, outsized returns, low risk and long duration. While we are very successful in finding outsized returns in off-market opportunities that we continue to execute on we're equally focused on lower risk and longevity. This is why we're obsessed with acquiring assets at a reasonable basis relative to replacement costs in order to reduce risk.\nAnd in terms of longevity, Page 20 of our business update will describe to you 30 or so win-win contractual partnerships that we have signed through a seamless way of trust where we hope to deploy 30-plus billion dollars of capital over the next decade and beyond. We see enormous opportunity for growth within our circle of confidence, which we define as the area where we can allocate capital with house odds instead of gamblers odds our predictive analytics platform.\nThis confluence of outsized internal and external growth has created a rare condition, which is called Leaping Emergent Effect or as Munger describes it, Lollapalooza effect. You as our owners can rest assured that we will not make any poor capital allocation decisions that will jeopardize these rare leaping emergent conditions that we have achieved through many years of hard work, luck, courage and a culture where everybody is all in.\nWith that, operator, please open the call up for questions. Thank you."

My name is Lisa, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Welltower Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Matt McQueen, General Counsel. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nMatthew Grant McQueen\n\nExecutive VP, General Counsel & Corporate Secretary, Welltower Inc.\n\nThank you, and good morning. As a reminder, certain statements made during this call may be deemed forward-looking statements in the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Although Welltower believes any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, the company can give no assurances that its projected results will be attained. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in the company's filings with the SEC.\nAnd with that, I'll hand the call over to Shankh for his remarks.\n\nShankh S. Mitra\n\nCEO, CIO & Director, Welltower Inc.\n\nThank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. Today, I would like to describe our capital allocation priorities, ProMedica Senior Care transaction and the rapidly evolving capital markets environment. I will also review some high-level business trends before handing the call over to John, who will provide details on operational trends and a brief update on our operating platform. I'm very pleased with the progress we have made since we last spoke 90 days ago. Despite a flattish earnings trends on a sequential basis, driven by several (inaudible) headwinds, including FX, interest rate and utility expenses, our underlying business is actually improving meaningfully and setting up for the coil spring recovery that we hoped for.\nIn our senior housing operating business, same-store revenue is up 10.8% year-over-year, driven by strong occupancy gains and most importantly, pricing power. 5.3% same-store rate growth is the best we have seen in our recorded history. And I want to remind everyone that we're compounding already industry-leading rate growth from last year.\nFrom these early trains, I believe we will see a further improvement in Q4, which will create a strong setup for 2023. However, perhaps what I'm most excited about is the progress we are making on the labor front with compensation per occupied unit is up 4.3% year-over-year, the lowest level of growth we have reported since the beginning of pandemic.\nOur operating partners are experiencing a significant surge in applications which has translated into a strong increase in net hiring. In fact, in September, total portfolio monthly contract labor spend was the lowest since August of 2021 and subsequently improved in October. We believe this trend will continue into year-end outside the normal pickup of agency use during the holiday season and into -- well into the next year.\nWe strongly believe that labor market is changing for the better, and it will help our sector to be a total standout amongst all real estate sectors next year on a relative basis. Show portfolio same-store NOI growth was 17.6% in the quarter, led by U.S., which posted third quarter of 20-plus percent growth, an assisted living product type reported same-store NOI growth of an impressive 25.1%.\nLet me highlight 3 operating partners for you that provide further insight into why I'm so pleased with our progress over the last 90 days. Number one, Oakmont. As you'll recall, we transitioned 10 top California assets to Oakland in August, while we expected some initial disruption to occupancy NOI during the transition in actuality, we recognized an immediate benefits due to remarkable performance from Courtney's team.\nThese assets have experienced a slight increase of NOI and occupancy despite challenges that are normally incurred during a transition. This is the first time we have seen a transition with no negative P&L impact apart from the 6 assets we transitioned to Oakmont last year. I expect these properties as well as the other assets that we transitioned to Oakmont to add significantly to our 2023 growth.\nIf you are visiting San Francisco this month for an NAREIT conference, I recommend you to join our property tour and experience firsthand the remarkable job this team has done. To my earlier point on shift of labor market during the summer, open positions across Oakmont platform was 16% of total jobs. It is down to low single digit at this point. Number two, StoryPoint.\nStoryPoint is 1 of our best operating partners, perhaps will be the source of biggest NY swing next year. We have $1 billion of investment with low occupancy properties, which is generating approximately 2.7% yield in Q3. StoryPoint made remarkable improvement in our top line on both occupancy and rates, but the properties have not generated significant NOI in 2022 as these properties were just over the breakeven occupancy and the agency cost was very detrimental. Their open positions are now down more than 50% through the end of October, and we expect 80% reduction of agency by end of this month.\nWe believe that stabilized NOI for this group of portfolio is about circa $80 million, which will be substantially achieved in 2024. While we'll not close this gap in 2023, I expect we'll make significant strides next year and will be over the half year (inaudible). We cannot be more [flushed] with the execution than and team has pulled off. Number three, Sunrise. Sunrise is our largest operator due to a national presence. Sunrise experienced significant labor challenges and that has had to rely on contract labor for last many quarters.\nJack and his team has made remarkable progress in this area over the last 60 days. contract labor down 52% from year-to-date run rate, and I believe Sunrise will be the biggest contributor to contract labor improvement in the coming months and quarters. Given strong rate Sunrise benefit from in this incredibly well-located Welltower billings, we should see extremely strong NOI growth contribution from Sunrise. While we are encouraged -- very encouraged by the trends and our fourth quarter guidance of 21% growth at the midpoint, I'll remind you that we are at the very early inning of senior housing recovery. We'll remain as excited as ever about the growth prospects in coming years and the 80-plus population growth will continue to accelerate. And as new construction in the sector will come to near a standstill.\nIn fact, 2023 should see 4.5% increase in AD population, as you may have observed only 2,700 units got started in Q3. And frankly, I don't even understand how these people will make any money in development. While new development should continue to come down, assuming people want to develop to make any money, another interesting phenomenon we are observing is that the thousands of units are being taken offline either because of obsolescence or because of higher and better use like behavioral health.\nAs of 9/30, almost 15,000 units were taken offline on a TTM basis. I also want to highlight consistent and steady performance of our outpatient medical group under Ryan's leadership, our retention rate for the quarter is a remarkable 92.7% and rent rates are ticking up into the mid-3s. Both new and renewal leases -- for both new and renewal leases, I'm pleased that our weighted average escalators are now above 3%. I'm also pleased that the low interest rate environment and the wall of capital that drove due to low 2% escalator seems to be a thing of the past.\nKLCC Bolt, which is our largest MOB tenant and also represents into a very significant portion of our development pipeline was acquired by United Health during this summer. The significant credit upgrade of our largest tenant and our development client represents a meaningful value creation for our shareholders. The most significant change we observed in this -- however, in the MOB space is the remarkable widening of cap rates. I've said it like a broken record for a long time that MOB cap has made no sense to us, given where the forward view of inflation was relative to underlying growth rate of the cash flow. I'm pleased to see other capital sources are now waking up to the ugly realities of real return on capital in this inflationary environment.\nThere was nothing wrong with this asset class except price, and I am relieve to see that has finally changed. Billions of dollars of transactions were consummated at low cap rates often with short-term floating rate debt. The party is over a with capital structure and cash flow as many of these vehicles are now upside down. We'll be observing the space closely in the coming months and quarter.\nNow I would like to discuss our recent restructuring of our lease with ProMedica Health System. I'm not going to bore you with the details of our fundamental thesis of this investment in 2018. I laid it out clearly when we did this transaction. We didn't predict COVID and its impact on the cash flow portfolio and frankly, were underwhelmed by the execution.\nBut the fundamental investment thesis of the original transaction should still protect our shareholders' capital that basis an appropriate structure are critical to any real estate investment. While we have historically relied on our operators' ability to drive cash flow and that yield, we never make real estate investment decision based on yield. We believe success in real estate investment over a long period of time is a function of right basis and staying power. If we own an apartment in New York City for $400,000, while everybody owns equivalent apartment for $1 million, you can still charge rent for that unit and generate strong returns.\nThat is such a simple yet perhaps one of the most overlooked concept on Wall Street. The capital funding of noise on ProMedica's negative EBITDA coverage over the last few months have reached a fever pitch. And we honestly understand and empathize with this Pavlovian response as the history of health care REIT sector is full of remedies such as massive rent cuts or disposal of assets at fire sale prices that result in significant value destruction to shareholders.\nEven though I'm personally humbled by the cash flow deterioration in the ProMedica portfolio, let me repeat that we are not experiencing a rent cut on a cash basis and our investors are the beneficiary of a satisfactory total return to date. And that goes back to our incredibly favorable basis and structure.\nTo continue my metaphor -- previous metaphor, Manhattan apartment rent might come down from $5,000 to $4,000 in a bad year, but we never hypothetically even charge $4,000 as we bought our unit at such a low price. That is why our rent is now going up, not down after this transaction. And I continue to believe it remains below market and will be a source of future value creation.\nAs I mentioned in our last call, ProMedica has made significant strides in reducing its operating losses, which have further narrowed in the last 90 days through both occupancy gains and lower labor costs -- contract labor costs, particularly. Integra brand entity, which we have done multiple transactions previously has successfully executed many turnarounds, including those involving HCR assets that we sold it to them in the last couple of years, and is well positioned to return these assets to its previous glory, using a regional operative strategy, just like they have done over the last couple of years.\nWe are looking through Integra's brand entity and the owner for the downside protection through subordination of their equity as well as significant other guarantees and will subsequently share significant value creation with us. But I cannot overemphasize that the fundamental idea of below-market rent -- basis equals to below market rent is not about ProMedica. It is about our belief how we invest and protect our shareholders' capital. If a business has demand growth and you can own it for significantly less than what it cost to build and a low leveraged capital structure, it is challenging for me to see how we lose money in most scenarios.\nWe remain partnered with ProMedica, all be done as such on a much smaller scale, and we'll be delighted to see the significant credit improvement of this important institution in Toledo.\nFinally, let's discuss the current capital markets environment, which excites me to know end. Before I go into what we might do in the future, let's discuss what we have done in the past under this leadership team. If we go back and read all our comments about capital deployment in the last few years, you will notice a few attributes.\nOne, we're unlevered IRR buyers and we underwrite significant cap rate expansion at exit. Hence, the recent rate increase don't fluster us just as we have never chased low rates down under the guise of low cost of capital. Two, our unrelenting focus on basis relative to replacement cost, and as a result, we seriously dislike low cap rates in stabilized occupancy scenarios. Nothing has happened so far, even in this turbulent capital markets backdrop that require us to change how we invest capital. We are experiencing historic volatility in the treasury market with every part of the yield curve inverted right now, with significantly the most important due to [10] curve is as inverted as it was during [Paul Walker's] time 40 years ago.\nOne approach for us would be to ride out this storm in a shelter and do nothing. But those of you who know us well, no, we're unlikely to do so. We maintain a very favorable capital position and a [warchest] due to our extremely talented capital markets team under the leadership of Tim. Despite our unfavorable public cost of capital on a spot basis today, we have no doubts of global institutions who want to partner with us. And let me remind you again, a simple capital allocation framework I've described to you before.\nEvery company effectively has 4 choices of raising capital: one, tapping internal cash flow; two, issuing debt; three, issuing equity; and four, disposition of existing assets. It also has 5 essential choices of deploying that capital: one, investing in existing assets; two, acquisitions; three, buying debt at a discount; four, paying a dividend; and five, buying stock at a discount. You can loosely call the first set of choices at selling, but the right description would be sourcing or raising capital. You can loosely call the second set of choices as buying, but perhaps the correct description will be deployment of capital. Following the same line of thinking, loosely speaking, consistently buying low and selling high creates value for shareholders.\nIn a more wholesome and thoughtful description, optimizing these choices from this menu of sources and uses in a tax-efficient manner creates meaningful value for continuing shareholders on a per share basis. Our goal is to maximize per share value and per share cash flow, not to become the biggest or the most revolutionary. Our capital allocation team on both sides of the balance sheet is poised to pound on this great menu of opportunities, while the most volatile interest rate environment in 4 decades has put in front of us. And at the same time, John's team is just getting started on the journey of cash flow and platform optimization.\nWith that, I'll pass it over to John. John?\n\nJohn F. Burkart\n\nExecutive VP & COO, Welltower Inc.\n\nThank you, Shankh. I'll provide some insight into our operating business, starting with the medical office portfolio. In the third quarter, same-store NOI growth for our outpatient medical business was 1.4% over the prior year's quarter, which was below trend due to some timing issues on tenant improvements, delay in move-ins and higher utility expenses. We continue to see strong retention levels at 93% in the quarter and accelerating renewal rates in the marketplace.\nTurning to our senior housing operating portfolio. The recovery in this sector continues. As Shankh mentioned, revenue in our same-store portfolio came in at 10.8% in the third quarter compared to the prior year's quarter. All 3 regions showed strong revenue growth, starting with Canada at 4.4%, the U.S. and U.K. growing at an impressive 11.6% and 18.9%, respectively.\nRevenue growth for the quarter was driven by a 390 basis point increase in occupancy and another quarter of healthy pricing power with REVPOR growth of 5.3%, as Shankh mentioned, the highest we've witnessed.\nSequentially, the portfolio occupancy continued to improve with the gain of 110 basis points during the quarter. While expenses remain a challenge, our operators continue to control expense for or expense per occupied room. The comp for or compensation per occupied room only grew at 4.3% in the third quarter over the prior year's quarter, the lowest growth rate since 2019. Expense for grew at a rate of 3.7% in the third quarter on a year-over-year basis, well below our REVPOR growth of 5.3% and driving expansion of 130 basis points on a year-over-year basis in our margins.\nAs our operators have pivoted from the COVID state to normalized operations, and as labor and materials have become more available, we have aggressively addressed maintenance that was delayed during COVID, which resulted in slightly elevated repairs and maintenance during the maintenance expense during the quarter.\nOverall, the quarter's occupancy gains, strong REVPOR and expense controls enabled the senior housing operating portfolio to deliver 17.6% year-over-year same-store NOI growth in the period led by the U.S. with over 20% year-over-year growth, while Canada NOI grew at 6.3% and the U.K. was up 9.8%. Going forward, we expect the operating portfolio to continue to deliver outside NOI growth with each geography expected to experience accelerating NOI growth in the fourth quarter.\nAs we look forward to what many believe will be a weaker labor market in 2023, it's important to realize that labor as an expense represents about 60% of our total expenses. Additionally, nurses are only about 5% of the labor force at the communities. And although there are other more specialized positions at the communities, most of the positions require skills that are transferable from other sectors of the economy, allowing us to benefit from the softer labor market, as Shankh noted.\nRegarding our operating platform, we continue to quickly move forward on plans to pilot our first module in early 2023 with several other modules in the works. Like all technology rollouts, it's about people, processes, data and then technology. So it's not about flipping a switch. It takes team works. The results will show up over time. Our meetings with our operators have been very productive as we bring together their skills and experience with our own to build a better future for the industry.\nFinally, I would like to thank our operators and their employees for making these results possible. It's been a full sprint since the beginning of COVID, and they have addressed 1 challenge after the next. We are finally at a point where it seems like there's light at the end of the tunnel, occupancy continues to rise. Net hiring is occurring month after month REVPOR continues to outpace expense for, which will drive further margin expansion and so much more. We wish to thank everyone and wish them a wonderful Thanksgiving, and thank you for your hard work. I'll now turn the call over to Tim.\n\nTimothy G. McHugh\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Welltower Inc.\n\nThank you, John. My comments today will focus on our third quarter 2022 results. The performance of our triple net investment segments in the quarter are capital activity, a balance sheet and liquidity update and finally, our outlook for the fourth quarter. Welltower reported third quarter normalized bunds from operations of $0.84 per diluted share, representing 6.2% growth over the prior year period when adjusting for HHS funds received and changes in FX rates. And marking our second consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth since the start of the pandemic. We also reported our second consecutive quarter of positive total portfolio same-store NOI growth with 7.2% year-over-year growth.\nTurning to our triple net lease portfolios. As a reminder, our triple-net lease portfolio coverage and occupancy stats reported a quarter arrears. So these statistics reflect the trailing 12 months ending 6/30, 2022. In our senior housing triple-net portfolio, same-store NOI increased 1.6% year-over-year, below the low end of our guidance range, which is primarily timing related. Trailing 12-month EBITDAR coverage was 0.83x in the quarter. Next, same-store NOI in our long-term post-acute portfolio grew 3.1% year-over-year and trailing 12-month EBITDA coverage 1.31x.\nAnd lastly, health systems, which is comprised of our joint venture with ProMedica Health System. As same-store NOI growth of positive 2.75% year-over-year and trailing 12-month EBITDARM and EBITDAR coverages were negative 0.01 and negative 0.6, respectively, as operations continue to be impacted by high agency utilization costs in the second quarter relative to the prior year.\nPutting these coverage figures in context of our announcement last night, trailing 12-month ProMedica Senior Care EBITDARM coverage of negative 0.01 implies trailing 12-month EBITDARM of negative $1.6 million. relative to $168 million of cash rent paid in the trailing 12-month period ending 6/30, 2022. The transition of the skilled nursing business will bring the remaining ProMedica Senior Care EBITDARM back to profitability with the trailing 12-month coverage of nearly 2x relative to the remaining rent on the 58 assisted living facilities that will continue to operate.\nThus, the transition to Integra Health has a dual benefit to providing us a well-capitalized and strategic partner to focus on the skilled nursing properties, while also leaving ProMedica Senior Care a substantially better financial state following the transaction.\nTurning to capital market activity. In the quarter, we continued to enhance our balance sheet strength by utilizing our ATM program to raise approximately $760 million of forward equity at an average price of $80.12. We settled 9.1 million shares for total proceeds of $842 million to fund $1 billion of net investment activity, leaving $1.5 billion of unsettled forward ATM as of 9/30.\nPost quarter end, we settled additional ATM proceeds to fund investment activity and pay down $850 million of total debt, $817 million of which was floating rate. Post that paydown, we have the full $4.0 billion available borrowing capacity on our line of credit and no unsecured maturities until 2024.\nWe expect to finish the fourth quarter with consolidated net debt to EBITDA below 6.5x for the first time since 2020. From a liquidity perspective, in addition to the $4 billion we passed in line of credit, we have $1 billion of cash and forward equity and $580 million remaining near-term dispositions and loan paydown proceeds at a 4.6 yield, representing $5.6 billion of total near-term liquidity.\nLastly, moving to our fourth quarter outlook. Last night, we provided an outlook for the fourth quarter of net income attributable to common stockholders of $0.08 to $0.13 per diluted share and normalized FFO of $0.80 to $0.85 per diluted share or $0.825 at the midpoint. As mentioned in the release, our fourth quarter guidance contemplates no HHS funds to be received in the fourth quarter.\nSo after adjusting for $0.015 of nonrecurring items, including HHS funds received in the third quarter were effectively flat for sequential FFO. The sequential change is composed of $0.02 from sequential increases in senior housing operating portfolio and $0.01 from sequential increases in outpatient medical and senior housing triple net. These are offset by $0.03 of interest expense and foreign exchange headwinds.\nUnderlying this FFO guidance is estimated total portfolio year-over-year same-store NOI growth of 8.5% to 10.5%, driven by subsegment growth of outpatient medical, 1.5% to 2.5%, long-term post-Q 2.5% to 3.5%, senior housing triple net 5% to 6%. And finally, senior housing operating growth of 18.5% to 23.5%, driven by revenue growth of approximately 9.5% year-over-year. Underlying this revenue growth is an expectation of approximately 200 basis points of year-over-year average occupancy increase and rent growth of approximately 7%. And with that, I'll hand the call back over to Shankh.\n\nShankh S. Mitra\n\nCEO, CIO & Director, Welltower Inc.\n\nThanks, Tim. One of my mentors, Peter Kaufman often says, life is not about predicting it's about positioning. Did we predict that ProMedica's EBITDA coverage will turn negative? Absolutely not. But we positioned for it and structured as such. Did we know it will happen and availability of credit in senior housing sector will weaken? No, but we positioned for it. We own more than 11,000 units of age-restricted and age-targeted apartments that will benefit from government agency backstop financing at very attractive pricing, from which we can generate a couple of millions of dollars of proceeds.\nDid we predict that our stock will be in the low 60s and we'll lose our access to equity capital? No, we didn't. But we positioned for it and raised $3.28 billion of capital at an average price of $86.55 this year. We have no idea if rates are going back down or going back up, and how ugly the capital markets environment might turn before it gets better. We are laser focused on what we can control and have an incredible organization that is railing to take advantage of the opportunities with house odds as opposed to gamblers odds. I cannot be more excited about the period of unprecedented per share value creation that we are embarking on for our existing owners. And with that, I'll open the call up for questions."

My name is Jenny, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time all participants are on a listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session later in the call, which will be restricted to analysts only. Please note this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Tyler Baba, Manager, Investor Relations. Mr. Baba, you may begin.\n\nTyler Baba\n\nThank you, operator, and welcome, everyone, to WELL Health Fiscal Second Quarter Financial Results Conference Call for the 3 months ended June 30, 2023. Joining me on the call today are Hamed Shahbazi, Chairman and CEO; and Eva Fong, the company's CFO. I trust that everyone has received a copy of our financial results press release that was issued earlier today. Portions of today's call, other than historical performance, include statements of forward-looking information within the meaning of applicable securities laws, including future-oriented financial information and financial outlook information. Forward-looking statements are necessarily based upon a number of estimates and assumptions that, while considered reasonable by management, are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies.\nThese forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors, many of which are outside of WELL's control that may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of WELL to differ materially from the anticipated results, performance or achievements implied by such forward-looking statements. These factors are further outlined in today's press release and in our management discussion and analysis. We provide forward-looking statements solely for the purpose of providing information about management's current expectations and plans relating to the future. We do not undertake or accept any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements to reflect any change in our expectations or any change in events, conditions, assumptions or circumstances on which any such statement is based, except if it is required by law.\nWe may use terms such as adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross margin, adjusted EBITDA, shareholder EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted free cash flow on this conference call, all of which are non-GAAP and non-IFRS measures. For more information on how we define these terms, please refer to the definition set out in today's press release and in our management's discussion and analysis. The company believes that adjusted EBITDA is a meaningful financial metric as it measures cash generated from operations, which the company can use to fund working capital requirements, service future interest and principal debt repayments and fund future growth initiatives. Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an alternative to net income or loss determined in accordance with IFRS. And with that, I will turn over the call to Mr. Hamed Shahbazi, Chairman and CEO.\n\nHamed Shahbazi\n\nFounder, Chairman & CEO\n\nThank you, Tyler, and good day, everyone. We hope that you're all keeping safe and healthy. We appreciate everyone for joining us today. We're very pleased with our record-breaking quarter and to be visiting with you today. In our quarter, we achieved record revenue and growth across all key metrics. Our record revenue, adjusted EBITDA, patient visits and provider count are a testament to the company's continued focus on tech enabling health care providers and supporting them and simplifying their work lives, modernizing and digitizing their clinical practices and delivering the best health care possible while exited Q2 2023 with over 3,200 providers and clinicians delivering 1 million patient visits, over 1 million patient visits. In fact, in the quarter through our own physical and virtual clinics without counting any of the technology interactions or technology-enabled visits that happen with other people's providers.\nIn addition, WELL had more than 31,000 providers -- supported by our own SaaS and technology services. We are extremely passionate about supporting our providers and every day, we focus on supporting them better. And this attitude and focus is what's allowed our company to continue to witness healthy growth across all its business segments, including both online and in-person care channels with minimal impacts due to recession, inflation, supply chain or other macroeconomic effects.\nThematically speaking, there are a few catalysts that I wanted to touch on in today's presentation and they are as follows: one, continued resilience in our multidimensional health care delivery platform that has allowed us to continue to deliver outstanding record results 18 quarters in a row and allowed us to yet again upgrade our guidance this quarter for the balance of the year. The growth of our R&D teams and costs demonstrate that we continue to invest in our growth, not only with M&A, but with internal investment, constantly strengthening our internal ability to grow and innovate. This is not only contributing to the health of the company, but positioning us to grow organically, as evidenced by our big Ocean MD contract win today; three, our continued focus on artificial intelligence and strategic internal and external planning and investments that allow us to leverage AI to help our providers and patients at scale while becoming a more efficient company. Four, our disciplined M&A growth engine and how it continues to yield tremendous results; and five, our relentless focus on integration and digitization.\nWELL has exhibited a keen focus both in the U.S. and Canada to improve efficiency and leverage our size and scale by integrating aspects of our business. Our efforts to constantly improve and tighten up our integrations never really stops due to our growing capabilities, new innovations and our dynamic company culture. As we've discussed before, at the heart of our company is our digital platform, which is being worked on by an internal team of over 100 dedicated product and engineering professionals and several dozen more externally on both sides of the border.\nIn Canada, our platform is quickly becoming one of the most important stretches of the digital health super highway for health care communications by enabling interoperability between HIS systems and core EMR systems and primary and specialized care providers. This was recently evidenced by our recent win with Ocean MD in British Columbia, where we were awarded a significant $38.5 million contract by the PSSA to help modernize and digitize the province's workflows with our next-generation e-Referral any consult platform. This contract win exemplifies just how strong our platform is, especially given that we now have substantial contracts with Ontario, Nova Scotia and now BC with other provinces engaged deeply with our business development teams. We are now working on taking our platform to the next level by elevating our product road map with the help of AI-related technologies.\nWe're pleased to report that all of our business units are executing well, and we're expecting to have strong performance for the remainder of 2023. The company does not foresee any material influences or challenges that would impair its ability to deliver solid results in 2023 as we are poised to invest in and achieve significant growth while delivering on enhanced profitability. Just last month, we increased our annual guidance by $50 million to be in between $740 million and $760 million for the year. We continued improvement in our outlook, and I'm pleased to provide an upgrade to our revenue guidance, which we now expect to be in the upper half of the $740 million to $760 million annual guidance. Essentially, we're expecting annual revenue to exceed $0.75 billion, representing annual revenue growth of at least 32%.\nJust a reminder, our guidance does not include any unannounced acquisitions. We also continue to guide for maintenance of Rule of 30 performance for the year. Achieving $0.75 billion in revenue this year is a significant milestone, which demonstrates that we're well on our way to reaching $1 billion in annual revenue. Our strong organic growth profile and compelling acquisition opportunities gives us visibility into achieving $1 billion revenue run rate within 2 years. Our adjusted EBITDA -- for our adjusted EBITDA, we're also pleased to reiterate our guidance for annual adjusted EBITDA to increase by more than 10% over 2022 levels. Our revenue growth continues to outpace our EBITDA growth in 2022 due to the reinvestment of any excess cash flows back into the business for growth. In addition, our acquisitions this year have had lower operating margins than our existing businesses. It is quite common for us to acquire businesses that aren't as profitable as our own as we then digitize and modernize these assets and increase their operating margins to be more in line with our own profitability profile. This is what we do, and this is what we have a proven track record of doing, improving the growth and profitability of our acquired assets. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to our CFO, Eva Fong, who will review the financials for fiscal quarter -- second fiscal quarter 2023. I will then come back and provide further commentary on our business units and outlook. Eva?\n\nEva Fong\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, Hamed. I'm pleased to report that we had very strong results for the 3 months ended June 30, 2023. Our overall second quarter results were as follows: WELL achieved record quarterly revenue of $170.9 million in Q2 2023, an increase of 22% as compared to revenue of $140.3 million generated during Q2 of last year. This growth was driven by acquisitions and organic growth. Year-to-date, WELL has achieved organic growth of 15%. WELL achieved record adjusted gross profit of $90.8 million in Q2 2023, an increase of 20% as compared to adjusted gross profit of $75.5 million in Q2 2022. Growth in the company's adjusted gross profit is attributable to higher revenue in the period. Adjusted gross margin percentage was 53% in both Q2 2023 and 2022.\nWELL achieved record adjusted EBITDA of $27.8 million in Q2 2023, an increase of 5% as compared to adjusted EBITDA of $26.4 million in Q2 of last year. Adjusted EBITDA attributable to WELL shareholders was $22.3 million in Q2 2023, an increase of 16% as compared to adjusted EBITDA attributable to WELL shareholders of $19.2 million in Q2 2022. Adjusted net income was $14.4 million or $0.06 per share in Q2 2023 as compared to adjusted net income of $17.5 million or $0.08 per share in Q2 2022. WELL generated 11% of its revenues from truly recurring and subscription revenues and 87% of its revenues from its highly recurring patient services revenues in Q2 2023. This means that approximately 98% of its revenues are highly predictable.\nI will now review our cement Q2 results. Our Canadian Patient Services business achieved another record quarter with revenue of $54.2 million in Q2 2023, an increase of 24% as compared to $43.7 million in Q2 of last year. With both primary care and my Health specialized care clinics achieving record revenue in this quarter. Primary Care revenues increased 39% to $24.9 million in Q2 2023 compared to $17.9 million in Q2 2022, primarily due to organic growth and acquisitions. During the second quarter, we completed the acquisition of 5 primary care clinics located in Calgary, Alberta from MCI One Health Technologies, which are expected to generate approximately $10 million in annual revenue.\nIn Q2 2023, MyHealth revenue increased 13% to $29.3 million as compared to $25.8 million in Q2 2022. This year-over-year growth is attributable to an increase in diagnostic procedures performed and the addition of new cardiologists to MyHealth practice. The second quarter is also the seasonally strongest quarter for MyHealth, resulting in a 12% increase in revenue compared to prior quarter Q1 2023. Our WELL Health USA Patient Services revenue was $103.5 million in Q2 2023, an increase of 30% as compared to $79.6 million in Q2 2022, driven by growth over the past year in all 3 of WELL Health USA's lines of business, that is Circle Medical, Wisp and CRH. In Q2 2023, CRH revenues were $63.4 million, an increase of 25% as compared to $50.9 million in Q2 2022. CRHs case volumes also continued to be very strong with over 135,000 anesthesia cases completed in Q2 2023, an increase of 8% compared to Q2 2022.\nCase volumes in the second quarter were positively impacted by the acquisition of affiliated Tampa Anesthesia Associates, which closed in the prior quarter in Q1 2023. CRH sold more than 32,000 O'Regan [indiscernible] units in Q2 2023 compared to over 45,000 units sold in Q2 2022. This year-over-year decline was due to a promotional campaign in the prior quarter, Q1 2023 when CRH sold a record of over 59,000 O'Regan\n[indiscernible] units. With the conclusion of this promotional campaign, [indiscernible] unit volumes decreased in Q2 but have now returned to near normal levels in Q3.\nCircle Medical revenues were $21 million in Q2 2023, an increase of 34% as compared to revenue of $15.6 million in Q2 of last year. Although Circle Medical experienced strong year-over-year revenue growth as we had guided in our Q1 conference call, we were expecting softer results as compared to Q1 2020. Circle Medical has been focused on expanding its physical clinic footprint over the first half of the year to support the forecasted end of the public health emergency by the U.S. federal government. That would end some COVID regulations associated with telehealth medicine, which more in-person business is required.\nCircle Medical now has 27 physical clinic locations across 21 states in the U.S., a significant increase compared to last year when Circle Medical only had 2 physical locations in the state of California. As Hamed will cover in the outlook portion of our comments today, Circle Medical is back in growth mode now, and we're expecting a healthy finish in the back half of the year. With achieved revenue of $19.1 million in Q2 2023, an increase of 46% as compared to revenue of $13.1 million in Q2 of last year. In the first half of the year where customer acquisition costs are lower, we were intentional in reinvesting operating cash flows generated by this business back into WISP growth. The balance of the year should continue to see strong growth with slightly improved profitability.\nSaaS and Technology Services revenues were $13.3 million in Q2 2023, a decrease of 22% as compared to $17 million in Q2 2022. This decline was due to timing of contracts in the company's cybersecurity-related business. Cybersecurity and data protection revenue tends to be lumpy, which resulted in strong quarterly revenue in Q1 2023, followed by lower revenue in this quarter. We are expecting Q3 revenue to bounce back again for this segment. Outside of cybersecurity, our remaining SaaS and services platform business increased 29% on a year-over-year basis to $11.3 million in Q2 2023 from $8.8 million in Q2 2022.\nWELL ended Q2 2023 with a solid balance sheet. As of June 30, 2023, WELL had cash and cash equivalents of $35.6 million. WELL continues to be in good standing and fully compliant with all covenants related with this 2 credit lines, JPMorgan in the U.S. and Royal Bank in Canada. The debt from the 2 credit lines was approximately CAD 233 million as of June 30, 2023. I'm also pleased to report we have further reduced WELL's shareholder leverage ratio to 2.3x as at the end of Q2 2023 compared to 3x as of Q2 2022, and compared to 2.6x in the prior quarter as at Q1 2023. We define leverage ratio as net bank debt, excluding convertible debentures, less cash on hand, divided by shareholder adjusted EBITDA. The improvement in WELL's leverage ratio was achieved by a decrease in the company's debt levels and an increase in shareholder adjusted EBITDA over the past year.\nIn terms of our share capitalization, as of August 9, 2023, WELL had 257,539,249 fully diluted securities issued and outstanding. That is my financial update, and I turn the call back over to Hamed.\n\nHamed Shahbazi\n\nFounder, Chairman & CEO\n\nThank you, Eva. I will now provide some specific outlook on our business units. First, with primary care. We're expecting our primary care business to exhibit healthy growth in the second half of the year due to both organic growth and the acquisition of clinics from MCI One Health in Alberta and Ontario. During the second quarter we completed the acquisition of 5 clinics from MCI, which are located in Calgary and will have a positive revenue impact to our Q3 results. We've already started the integration of these 5 clinics into our national clinic network and things are going WELL. Then on July 19, WELL entered into an agreement with MCI that includes the acquisition of all but one of their clinical assets located in Southern Ontario, which are expected to generate annual revenues of more than $21 million. This acquisition brings more than 130 physicians to the WELL family and significantly expands WELL's footprint and breadth of services in Ontario. These MCI clinics in Ontario are expected to come on board in October and provide a revenue boost to our primary care business in the fourth quarter.\nInitially, we're expecting EBITDA to be negatively impacted by the acquired MCI clinics in Alberta and Ontario. Notwithstanding this, we've established a strong plan to improve the efficiency and output of these clinics by leveraging WELL's operating playbook, which includes extensive use of our practitioner enablement platform. As we go through the process of digitizing and modernizing these clinics, we expect them to become profitable in 2024. One of the exciting aspects of this acquisition is the fact that we will now have a much larger base of primary care clinics in Ontario and can refer into our MyHealth specialized care network, which will only strengthen our overall business in Ontario.\nAnd that leads us to MyHealth. My Health had an outstanding quarter with strong year-over-year growth and improved profitability with Q2 being seasonally the strongest quarter for MyHealth. We do expect MyHealth revenue to decline in Q3 2023 compared to Q2 due to seasonality, however, we anticipate a healthy trajectory is demonstrated in year-over-year strength in the back half of the year. In reference to Ontario's Bill 60, your Health Act, which allows out-of-hospital facilities to perform publicly funded surgeries and diagnostic procedures, including MRI and CT, we continue to await the highly anticipated final regulations and call for applications for licensing. Although exact timelines are not publicly released, we anticipate a call for applications to occur in Q4.\nMyHealth Center continues to be highly engaged throughout the process with the optimism of serving the patients of Ontario and helping reduce MRI and CT patient times the following calendar year. If successful in obtaining MRI/CT licenses additional capital cost to purchase the scanners and extensive leasehold improvements would be required. We anticipate lead times of close to 9 months to have these services fully operational clinics. As such, we don't expect any revenue in 2023 from the release of this regulation.\nI'll now discuss the outlook for our newly branded WELL Health USA business. On July 27, the company announced that it had rebranded CRH Medical and launched WELL Health USA, a multidisciplinary health care business spanning primary and specialized care with on and off-line operations at scale. Well Health USA's goal is to mirror WELL's mission of tech-enabled care providers in the United States, while digitizing and modernizing their health care businesses.\nIn addition, WELL Health USA will leverage its deep U.S.-based health care expertise and structural advantages to create a whole new category of shared services that will benefit and deliver improved integration and facilitate further growth between WELLs U.S.-based lines of business. WELL Health USA is a highly profitable and rapidly growing business with operating run rate revenues of approximately CAD 0.5 billion. It's also important to note that we have a really outstanding team there with over 100 years of combined experience in allocating capital, integrating and growing health care businesses and working inside of some of the largest and most prominent health care companies in the United States.\nThe different lines of business under WELL Health USA includes CRH Anesthesia, CRH O'Regan, Radar Healthcare Providers, Circle Medical and WISP. I'll now provide a quick update on these businesses. First, CRH. CRH is having an outstanding year so far. We expect CRH anesthesia case volumes to continue to follow normal seasonal patterns in 2023 with the highest number of cases increasing in each quarter, with Q4 2023 again being forecast as strongest revenue quarter again this year for CRH. CRH anesthesia services should get a boost in revenue in Q3 from the addition of 18 ASC practices from the CarePlus acquisition as well. Also, CRH's efforts to digitize operations are bearing fruit. CRH has invested substantially into its revenue cycle management program with implementations of numerous new digital tools designed to improve business intelligence, collections visibility and collections performance.\nOn June 22, 2023, the company announced that CRH had made strategic investment in Graphium Health, a leading EMR company focused on anesthesia practices. The investment is part of a strategic alliance designed to further digitize and modernize CRH's back, billing and back office processes. Based on a recent pilot project with Graphium Health, CRH has demonstrated that it had improved its time to capture billable charges by 58% or 5.6 days and reduced its overall accounts receivable balance as the pilot project sites by 24%. As a result of the successful pilot investment, CRH Medical plans to expand this initiative to at least 54 additional ASCs over the next 3 years where CRH provides anesthesia services.\nSecondly, Radar. We're very pleased to be welcoming the Radar Healthcare Providers team to the WELL family as part of the CarePlus acquisition. Radar provides staffing and locum tenant services, focus on anesthesia providers with a specialization in anesthesiologists recruitment and placement for its network of customers, which include provider groups, hospitals and ASCs across 29 states. With a database of over 70,000 anesthesia providers to leverage, Radar has served over 150 clients to date and is well positioned to further increase its footprint of providers and clients. Greater adds significant upside for growth and diversification beyond clinical anesthesia services to include recruitment services. Radar is also well positioned to serve as a shared service provider -- shared service for provider recruitment and billing services to the other U.S.-based businesses in WELL's portfolio.\nFurthermore, WELL Health USA intends to expand the scope of Radar to other specialties and health care professionals such as physician specialists, primary care and nursing professionals. We're off to a great start with Radar so far and seeing revenues and growth in line with our expectations.\nAnd now for Circle Medical. Last quarter, we mentioned that there would be some temporary softness in medical -- Circle Medical's Q2 results as management's focus had shifted from expanding its physical clinic network and the prompt return to growth as the company makes growth it's primary priority again, we were right on both accounts. The Circle Medical team put an enormous amount of focus and energy into being compliant with the end of the public health emergency in May and expected removal of COVID era waivers allowing companies such as surgical medical to prescribe controlled substances via telemedicine. This involves expanding its in-person clinic network from a few clinics to 27 and seeing over 13,000 telemedicine patients, 66% of our target in person within 1 quarter, a logistical feat unmatched by Circle's competitors.\nThe waivers were extended at the last minute, and we are optimistic that recent moves by the DEA will lead to a more flexible regulatory environment that allows for prescription of controlled substances without an in-person appointment where clinically appropriate. Either way, we are resilient and extremely well prepared for any direction that the DEA takes given our robust in personal clinical network and proven ability to rapidly adapt to changing circumstances. We were accurate in our prediction of a rapid return to a focus on growth post public health emergency. Based on booking data, we have high confidence that Circle Medical is already exceeding a run rate of over CAD100 million and profitable in August, and we expect strong month-over-month growth for the balance of the year.\nThe growth in revenues and our projections for the balance of the year has primarily to do with Circle Medical growth team turning their attention from establishing a strong physical network to onboarding physicians. In fact, in the last 4 weeks, we have increased the number of physicians onboarded by more than 25% over the previous month and continue to ramp up as we have retooled our provider recruitment process to onboard more providers in the less time than before.\nAnd now a few words on WISP. Last quarter, we discussed how West is retooling some of its key product and distribution partners, which resulted in slower growth in Q2 and minimal adjusted EBITDA contribution in the first half of the year. I'm pleased to report that WISP has mostly completed this work and we are now expecting revenue growth to be stronger in the second half of the year with improved profitability. Additional spending in Q1 and Q2, primarily on marketing costs, to gain new patients and drive additional revenues is already starting to pay off thus far in Q3. In fact, July was a record month of revenue for the company with USD 5 million in revenues.\nWith the recent launch of our new and improved online platform, we are now able to launch new products more quickly and efficiently and have plans to launch 10 new products over the next several months. For example, just a couple of weeks ago, WISP became the first telehealth brand in the United States to bring DoxyPEP, the morning after pill for STDs to market.\nFinally, our SaaS and Technology Services business, as we had previously guided in our last call, cybersecurity and data protection business had close to its best quarter ever in Q1. But being a lumpy business, revenues declined in the second quarter as we had expected. Cybersecurity revenues can often be impacted by the timing of hardware shipments at the end of the quarter. Thus far, Q3 is looking like a stronger quarter again with several contracts delivered. We're expecting a bounce back in cybersecurity revenues, while the rest of the SaaS services business continues to perform with steady growth and profitability. OceanMD is a key component of our SaaS and technology services group and is emerging as a leader in patient engagement and e-referral solutions. Ocean's e-referral software allows primary care providers to send their request to surgeons through the Ocean e-Referral network instead of faxing, e-mailing or mailing, which makes surgical console easier -- referrals easier and reduces wait times for patients.\nOceanMD is already the dominant e-referral solution in the province of Ontario. Last quarter, we reported that OceanMD has been selected by the province of Nova Scotia first referral solution. And this week, obviously, today, OceanMD, we reported signed a $38.5 million contract with BC PSSH providing an array of digital services such as e-referrals, e-consults and e-orders to help -- tech-enable providers with the best-in-class digital interoperability tools. With this win in BC, we feel OceanMD has the potential to become the e-referral standard across the country.\nOceanMD has notably proven its ability to reduce wait times by as much as 52 days, including a 35-day reduction in referral processing time alone, thereby significantly improving access to care. In Ontario, the implementation of OceanMD's platform was shown to result in a 12% reduction in medically unnecessary MRIs, underlining a direct cost saving impact for provincial health systems. One of the things that is really truly special about Ocean is that it's the only piece of commercial software that we know of that connects with all the major EMR NHIS systems in the country. That means that it connects into TELUS Health, Accuro, Wells Oscar and other EMR systems in addition to major EMR and EHR systems for hospitals such as Epic and Cerner.\nMoving on to the WELL EMR Group. We're also very excited to report that our intra-health EMR team was selected by another government agency in New Zealand on a significant multimillion dollar contract, which includes over $1 million in ERR and more than $1 million in implementation services.\nI'll now provide an update on our AI-related activities. We're incredibly excited about the potential of AI and healthcare. Our vision is that AI-powered solutions can have positive impact on the health care sector by giving health care providers clinical and decision support tools that will give them their time back, enhance clinical productivity and provide a better patient experience. We are determined to faithfully support and tech-enabled health care professionals with the very best technology available, which now includes significant investments in AI-based products and services.\nLast quarter, I highlighted that WELL had made AI a priority, and I'm pleased to report that we're starting to see some of the operating improvements as a result of leveraging AI internally, including: one, reduced team member Q-monitoring. One of our platform teams first-line support group now leverages GPT4-powered AI solutions that pull answers from internal resources and automatically response to acquiring customers; two, we're leveraging intelligent chat bots to provide improved access to knowledge outside of support hours as well as improved response rates and experience for patients who are reaching out for support; and three, a number of our internal development teams have been heavily leveraging Microsoft Copilot and starting to benefit from generative AI solutions that can significantly increase developer productivity.\nIn addition to this, we're working on compelling new products and enhancements to roll out to our provider network. In Q2, we did just that with the launch of several key initiatives, including WELL AI voice and the WELL AI investment program. And a few words on AI voice. WELL AI voice is a transformational ambient scribed product that leverages generative AI to dramatically reduce the providers' administrative burden by privately and securely capturing a patient encounter in conversation and automatically generating a succinct and medically relevant chat note for the patient interaction. WELL AI voice is a powerful tool that is able to communicate seamlessly with WELL's EMR products, making it easy for providers to deploy, manage and benefit from the technology quickly without having to harmonize the usage of disparate tools.\nProviders love WELL AI voice because it allows them to focus more of their consultation time on the patient and spend less time taking notes. Patients love the experience because they no longer have to compete with the doctor's laptop for attention. One of our physicians was recently quoted by our sales team as saying, WELL AI voice has made my work life amazing, and now I look forward to coming to work to use it. Strong statements like this demonstrate the value of WELL AI voice and the real impact it has on day-to-day lives of positions. We've had a controlled rollout to ensure quality, safety and security and ensure that results are as intended to date.\nAnd we can say that WELL AI voice has seamlessly integrated into more than 5,000 patient visits so far. We've seen strong user growth with the average physician using the tool for more than 230 sessions per month. All of this demonstrates growing trust in our product and its efficiency in the real-world healthcare setting. While we are providing this technology for subscriptions in our EMR network, we are also planning to roll it out to the majority of WELL's primary care operations in the balance of the year and are excited about the benefits that it affords our internal network.\nAs part of our commitment to developing AI technologies, WELL announced the AI investment platform, whose goal it is to invest in at least 10 companies and to ensure that each investee has a strategic alliance agreement with WELL and allows it to benefit from WELL's health care ecosystem. Since launching the program, we've already connected with more than 125 new companies and have spent considerable time to narrow down the group to approximately 2.5 dozen companies where we're having deeper conversations.\nWe are already in discussion on terms with a handful of these companies and expect to have some exciting developments to share soon. Before we conclude the call, I'd like to provide some additional commentary on the MCI strategic alliance and investment. As part of the agreements with MCI, WELL purchased the MCI Ontario clinics for consideration of $1.5 million and acquired the debt of a key creditor for $3.5 million to help facilitate the deal.\nFinally, WELL will also lead a new investment round into MCI in which WELL will commit at least $2.5 million as part of a convertible debenture financing of up to $10 million. Going forward, MCI will be strategically focused on its leading AI, data science and rare and complex disease detection platform. WELL also intends to enter into a strategic alliance agreement designed to provide WELL clinics with leading-edge technology from MCI and better position MCI as a key national leader in Canada.\nAs part of the strategic alliance, WELL has joined MCI's Board of Directors and subject to satisfaction of certain conditions. WELL will also hold an option to acquire up to 30.8 million Class A and Class B shares in MCI over time. This means that WELL will have an opportunity in the future to acquire control of MCI One Health. In the event elects to do so -- it elects to acquire the multi-voting shares it has optioned out subject to the terms and conditions of its various agreements, covenants and rights.\nWe believe the multibillion-dollar disease detection industry is a big opportunity for MCI with its Cure Health platform. Cure Health is already available on the apps.health platform and is integrated into WELL's Astepro EMR. We're looking forward to working with MCI in developing and amplifying this world-class technology. In addition, we believe MCI is an ideal company for building additional healthcare-related data science and AI technologies.\nWe're really excited about the upside investment potential offered by the new strategic direction and the recapitalization of MCI One Health. We have big and extensive plans here folks, stay closely tuned.\nIn summary, we are very pleased with our financial performance thus far in 2023 and look forward to delivering strong results again for the balance of the year. Our outlook for 2023 remains positive. Hence, I am confident in upgrading our annual guidance again with more of our guided EBITDA appearing in Q4 versus Q3. And please keep in mind that the big contract win announced today doesn't contribute meaningfully to this year's results. We have many tailwinds driving growth in the business, and we have a committed and disciplined team to ensure that we're able to execute on our objectives.\nIn closing, I will provide an update on our ongoing ESG program. I'm proud to have released WELL's second ESG report on July 7, entitled, 'Taken care of the care providers'. This report highlights WELL the ESG strategy, reporting initiatives and targeted actions. WELL is a purpose-driven company that aims to transform the world for the better, as such, our ESG report outlines this objective.\nFinally, I want to thank you all for joining us on this call today, and thanks to our shareholders and investors for their continued support. The capital markets have been very supportive of our vision and have provided us with the funding needed to pursue our goals and support our providers. I would also like to thank WELL's senior management team and all our employees and contractors for their tremendous effort. In particular, I'd like to thank our team of healthcare practitioners and other frontline workers who provide unbelievable patient care. They remind us every day why we're here, and we are here to support them. With that, we will be open to receive some questions now. Operator, can you please facilitate."

My name is [ Ludi ], and I'll be your conference operator today. [Operator Instructions] Please note this conference is being recorded. I'll now turn the call over to Mr. Tyler Baba, Manager, Investor Relations. Mr. Baba, you may begin.\n\nTyler Baba\n\nManager of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, operator, and welcome, everyone, to WELL Health Fiscal Fourth Quarter and Annual Financial Results Conference Call for the 3 and 12 months ended December 31, 2023. Joining me on the call today are Hamed Shahbazi, Chairman and CEO; and Eva Fong, the company's CFO. I trust that everyone has received a copy of our press release that was issued earlier today.\nPortions of today's call, other than historical performance, include statements of forward-looking information within the meaning of applicable securities laws, including future-oriented financial information and financial outlook information. These forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors, many of which are outside of wealth control and that may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of WELL to differ materially from the anticipated results performance or achievements implied by such forward-looking statements.\nThese factors are further outlined in today's press release and can be found in our management discussion and analysis. We provide forward-looking statements solely for the purpose of providing information about management's current expectations and plans relating to the future. We do not undertake or accept any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements to reflect any change in our expectations or any change in events, conditions, assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based, except if it is required by law.\nWe may also use terms such as adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross margin, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted shareholder EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted free cash flow on this conference call, all of which are non-GAAP and non-IFRS measures. For more information on how we define these terms, please refer to the definition set out in today's press release and in our MD&A.\nThe company believes that adjusted EBITDA is a meaningful metric as it measures cash generated from operations, which the company can use to follow working capital requirements, service future interest and principal debt repayments and fund future growth initiatives. Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an alternative to net income and loss determined in accordance with IFRS.\nAnd with that, let me turn the call over to Mr. Hamed Shahbazi, Chairman and CEO.\n\nHamed Shahbazi\n\nFounder, Chairman & CEO\n\nThank you, Tyler, and good day, everyone. We hope that you're all keeping safe and healthy, and we appreciate everyone for joining us today. We're extremely pleased to be with you today and discuss our annual 2023 results, which was a record-breaking year in which we achieved record revenue, record adjusted EBITDA, record patient visits and positive net income. We achieved 36% overall revenue growth in 2023 with over 15% organic growth in the business, which includes clinics added to the network for nominal consideration as part of our clinic absorption program.\nWe remain committed to the company's continued focus on tech enabling health care providers and supporting them in simplifying their work lives, modernizing and digitizing their clinical practices and delivering the best health care possible. And this is evident in our increasing patient visits. During the year 2023, WELL delivered over 4.2 million patient visits to our physical and virtual clinics and a total of over 1.77 million patient interactions. WELL now serves more than 34,000 health care practitioners with our SaaS and technology services in Canada alone, which is equal to approximately more than one out of every three health care providers in the country.\nWe're extremely passionate about supporting our providers and every day we focus on supporting them better. This attitude and focus is what allows the company to continue to witness healthy growth across all business segments, including both online and in person care channels. We expect our strong performance to continue into 2024. We do not foresee any material influences or challenges that would impair our ability to deliver solid results in 2024 in any of our businesses as we are poised to maintain and even accelerate our growth without meaningful capital allocation while delivering on enhanced profitability, and I'm pleased to provide our 2024 annual guidance as follows: we are increasing our annual revenue guidance to be in the range of $950 million to $970 million, representing annual revenue growth of up to 25%. In the past, I've mentioned our goal of achieving $1 billion in revenue with the revenue guidance of $950 million to $970 million that I provided today, we're easily within reach of that $1 billion milestone.\nKeep in mind that this annual guidance does not include any unannounced acquisitions. Even though we're now favoring organic growth over acquisitions, we do continue to have a pipeline of mostly smaller tuck-in acquisition potentials and we expect a number of them will be completed this year, which should put us in a position to report that we crossed the $1 billion in revenue figure on a run rate basis by the end of 2024. For our annual adjusted EBITDA guidance, we expect to be in the range of $125 million to $130 million, representing annual growth of up to 15%. Comparatively, we achieved 8% growth in adjusted EBITDA in 2023 and 73% growth in 2022.\nAs you can see, our expected EBITDA growth is accelerating as our expected EBITDA growth is significantly higher than it was in 2023, and we expect this to happen with less capital allocation activity. Our improvements in EBITDA in 2024 are driven by several factors, but I'll quickly point out four of them. One, WELL has implemented a comprehensive cost optimization program to enhance its operational efficiency and profitability. This program has been implemented in both Canada and the United States and includes a streamlined approach to staff restructuring, increased utilization of technology and where possible, AI for process improvements and optimization, consolidation of suppliers, higher integration of our business units, and other cost optimization initiatives, which are expected to result in millions in annual cost savings; two, continued performance from our Canadian operations which experienced a 39% year-over increase in 4-wall EBITDA to $45.2 million.\nWe will talk a bit more about this later as our Canadian business has significant momentum. Three, last year's acquisitions of MCI and the large Manitoba clinics had a dampening effect on our EBITDA last year. However, our clinic transformation team and shared services teams are already hard at work in their efforts to optimize and digitize these clinics. And as such, we expect them to have improved margins and profitability in 2024. And four, in addition, the acquisition of CarePlus by WELL USA last year, which added incremental revenue and EBITDA to our core anesthesia business as well as our provider staffing services, which had a strong organic growth profile associated with it.\nWe expect strong cash flow generation in 2024 and given that we plan to focus more on organic growth, which includes our clinic absorption program and acquisition volume, we plan to use our positive cash flow to reduce debt levels this year, thereby also reducing our interest expense run rate. 2024 is also a significant milestone year for us as we have important time lines related to both our U.S. digital patient services businesses. Circle Medical and WISP.\nBoth of these businesses have call option and IPO registration option time line that expire in the near future unless extended and result -- and as a result of that, we've begun to partner with minority shareholders and management to consider strategic alternatives for both businesses, which could include a sale for one or both assets. Given how we believe this could be a key positive catalyst for WELL in terms of significantly delevering and returning value to shareholders.\nWith that, I would now like to turn the call over to our CFO, Eva Fong, who will review the financials for fiscal 2023 and fourth quarter of 2023. I will then come back and provide further commentary on our business units. Eva?\n\nEva Fong\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, Hamed. I'm pleased to report that we had very strong results for the 3 and 12 months ended December 31, 2023. Our overall annual financial results were as follows. Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023, was $776.1 million, compared to total revenue of $569.1 million for the prior year, an increase of 36%, driven by acquisitions and organic growth during the past year.\nWELL organic growth for the year was approximately 15%. Adjusted gross profit was $372.3 million in 2023, an increase of 23% as compared to adjusted gross profit of $303.3 million in 2022. Adjusted EBITDA was $113.4 million in 2023, an increase of 8% as compared to adjusted EBITDA of $104.6 million in 2022. Adjusted EBITDA to WELL shareholders was $88.4 million in 2023, an increase of 15% as compared to adjusted EBITDA to WELL shareholders of $76.6 million in 2022. Adjusted net income was $52.4 million or $0.22 per share in 2023, a decrease of 2% as compared to adjusted net income of $53.7 million or $0.24 per share in 2022.\nAdjusted free cash flow was $42.4 million for 2023, a decrease of 13% as compared to adjusted free cash flow of $48.9 million for 2022. The decrease was mainly due to higher tax and interest payments, offsetting the increase in shareholder EBITDA. Net income was $16.6 million or $0.00 per share in 2023, a decrease of 11% as compared to net income of $18.7 million or $0.00 per share in 2022. We calculated earnings per share based on earnings attributable to well. Our fourth quarter financial results were as follows: well achieved record quarterly revenue of $231.2 million in Q4 2023, an increase of 48% as compared to revenue of $156.5 million generated during Q4 2022.\nThis growth was driven by acquisitions and organic growth. WELL achieved record adjusted gross profit of $101 million in Q4 2023, an increase of 26% as compared to adjusted gross profit of $80.2 million in Q4 2022. Growth in the company's adjusted gross profit is attributable to higher revenue in the period. WELL achieved record adjusted EBITDA of $30.8 million in Q4 2023, an increase of 13% as compared to adjusted EBITDA of $27.2 million in Q4 20202. Adjusted EBITDA attributable to WELL shareholders was $22.6 million in Q4 2023, an increase of 7% as compared to adjusted EBITDA attributable to WELL shareholders of $21.1 million in Q4 2022.\nAdjusted net income was $11.2 million or $0.05 per share in Q4 2023 as compared to adjusted net income of $12.5 million or $0.05 per share in Q4 2022. Adjusted free cash flow was $12.7 million in Q4 2023, an increase of 23% as compared to adjusted free cash flow of $10.3 million in Q4 2022. This was mainly due to higher EBITDA generation. Net income was $33.8 million or $0.12 per share in Q4 2023, an increase of 53% as compared to net income of $22.1 million or $0.09 per share in Q4 2022.\nWe calculated earnings per share based on earnings attributable to WELL. In the fourth quarter, while generated 9% of its revenues from truly recurring and subscription revenues and 88% of its revenues from its highly reoccurring patient services revenues. This means that approximately 97% of its revenues are highly predictable. WELL ended 2023 with a solid balance sheet. As at December 31, 2023, WELL had cash and cash equivalents of $43 million.\nOn January 26, 2024, the company refinanced its syndicated credit facility with JPMorgan Chase Bank for USD 300 million, consisting of a primary USD 175 million credit facility with an additional USD 125 million accordion for future growth. The credit facility includes two new syndicate members, Bank of Montreal and Export Development Corporation, which is wholly owned by the government of Canada and the term has been extended to January 26, 2027.\nWELL continues to be in the standing and fully compliant with all covenants related with its two credit lines JPMorgan in the U.S. and Royal Bank in Canada. The company's total bank debt increased to $297 million at the end of Q4 2023 due to cash required for the CarePlus acquisition. This compares to total bank debt of $293 million at the end of the prior quarter Q3 2023. WELL's shareholder leverage ratio also increased slightly as a result of the higher bank debt levels to 2.7x as at the end of Q4 2023 compared to 2.6x in the prior quarter Q3 2023.\nPlease note that we define leverage ratio as total bank debt less cash on hand, divided by shareholder adjusted EBITDA after certain pro forma adjustments. We exclude convertible debentures from this calculation because convertible debentures are not included in our bank covenants. In terms of our share capitalization, as of March 20, 2024, WELL had 264,130,019 fully diluted securities issued and outstanding.\nThat is my financial update, and I turn the call back over to Hamed.\n\nHamed Shahbazi\n\nFounder, Chairman & CEO\n\nThank you, Eva. I'll now provide some specific outlook on the business units. First, our Canadian clinics business, which is now overseen by Dr. Michael Frankel, our Chief Medical Officer. This division includes our primary care business and our well diagnostic centers previously referred to as MyHealth.\nOverall, Canadian clinics achieved total revenue of $230 million in 2023, an increase of 27% from 2022. Fourth quarter was another record quarter for Canadian clinics with revenue increasing 31% as compared to Q4 2022, driven by healthy organic growth in our primary care clinics as well as the acquisition of NCI Ontario clinics and our first clinic in Manitoba. For 2024, we're expecting revenues from our Canadian clinics to be over $300 million, along with strong EBITDA margins as we expand margins for the newer clinics in our network.\nWe believe the Canadian market continues to be an enormous generational untapped opportunity. This is very much a land grab opportunity for the company given its strong digital business that supports over 1/3 of all physicians in the country it's growing brand recognition and the structural advantages we enjoy as a large physician group in the outpatient market. and the largest owner operator of outpatient clinics across the 5 most populous provinces of Canada, namely Alberta, BC, Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec, providing multiple services, including primary care, diagnostic, Allied Health, Specialty Care and longevity medical services.\nWith 167 clinics and 98 facilities in Canada, we are the largest player, and yet we have only have approximately just under 1% market share of all physician spending in Canada, which is a large multibillion-dollar opportunity. We believe we can grow our Canadian patient services business from $300 million in 2024 to exceed $1 billion as a stand-alone revenue business in the not-too-distant future.\nAnd generally speaking, we don't see why we wouldn't be able to achieve up to 10% of market share over time. Our Canadian clinics business is also generating significant profitability. In 2023, Canadian clinics 4-wall EBITDA grew by 37.8% year-over-year to approximately $33 million in adjusted EBITDA, which is roughly 2/3 of the total 4-wall operating EBITDA profit in our Canadian business, which includes our SaaS and services business as well.\nThis increase in profitability in our Canadian clinics business is proven that our business model is working. For example, in our primary care segment where our outlook for 2024 is very strong. We are at times acquiring clinics that have low EBITDA margins, and in some cases, such as MCI, Ontario clinics and the Manitoba Clinic, these clinics had negative EBITDA margins and will take a couple of quarters to see improved EBITDA margins.\nOnce a new clinic is added to our network under the leadership of Jeremy Mickolwin, our clinic transformation team extensively uses our own digital practitioner enablement platform and shared services program to modernize and digitize these clinics, which results in improved cost efficiency and operating support for physicians, along with a significant improvement in EBITDA margins. We genuinely believe our clinic transformation team and capabilities are a unique superpower of the company and are helping physicians improve their business clinic by clinic.\nWe believe the issue of lack of digitization is existential for our primary care clinic industry in Canada. If a clinic doesn't digitize and relieve low leverage work to software and workflow, it simply cannot survive given the growing cost of labor. Well's current pipeline of new clinic opportunities is roughly 50 clinics, of which approximately third would be actionable under our absorption model where we have minimal acquisition costs and the balance would be under our regular M&A program.\nIn this pipeline, we're still seeing lower multiples and significant opportunities to acquire quality clinics at low prices particularly in primary care. The clinic absorption model is a very unique opportunity for WELL because of our national footprint, increasing brand recognition and the strong support and value proposition that we provide our health care providers, doctors are seeking us out to join the well network and take over the operation of their clinics.\nDoctors are facing such significant technology challenges administrative overhead issues that they're increasingly don't want to run their own clinics and are seeking out well to become their operating partners. Under this absorption model, we simply take over the lease of the clinic and the doctors join our network. There is no capital cost in most cases. And for this reason, we see absorbed clinics as merely an extension of our own recruitment efforts.\nHere, instead of recruiting physicians, we're including entire clinics with a full roster of patient and provider relationships. We believe that our organic growth and recruitment of absorption opportunities will continue to significantly grow in 2024. And now a few words about WELL Health Diagnostic Centers, which is essentially a rebrand of MyHealth centers. WELL Health diagnostic achieved record revenue of $111.3 million in 2023, which was entirely driven by organic growth.\nRevenue in the fourth quarter was a slight decline compared to Q3, which is reflective of our normal seasonality. Q4 revenue was also slightly lower than Q4 of last year as the previous year's cycle, there was irregular due to COVID restrictions being lifted in 2022, which drove increased revenue towards the end of the calendar year. Notwithstanding the lower revenue, unique -- overall unique patients grew by 5% year-over-year for Q4 2023 versus Q4 2022.\nFor 2024, we are expecting our diagnostic centers to achieve another year of record revenue and EBITDA. Organic growth is driven by expansion of services and an increase in the number of health care providers, which allows us to serve more patients. Our operating team led by Dina Sergi, have done a fantastic job optimizing costs, while the business continues to grow and gain momentum. I'm pleased to share a couple of new services also provided by the WELL Health diagnostic centers.\nOne, first, as of Q4 2023, we are participating in the expansion of PET scanning for prostate cancer screening. Previously, such studies were only performed in hospitals, but due to the increased demand and the Cancer Care Ontario guidance, this is now offered in selected integrated community health service centers, such as ours. Secondly, the government of Ontario will allow women to self-refer for mammograms beginning at age 40 under the Ontario breast screening program commencing in the fall of 2024. Although this becomes available this year, we're already seeing a notable increase in mammograms of 11% from Q3 2023 with intensification and awareness.\nWe're also keeping a close eye on Ontario's Bill 60, Your Health Act, which allows out-of-hospital facilities to perform publicly funded surgeries and diagnostic procedures, including MRI and CT scans. We understand that there may be a call for new applications in the coming months, and we intend to support the diagnostic needs of the province of Ontario. We are now seeing acquisition multiples finally start to moderate and become more reasonable on the specialized care and diagnostic opportunities.\nGiven this, we're looking forward to expanding our diagnostic centers to more provinces in 2024. I will now discuss outlook for our WELL Health USA business, our well-held USA patient and provider services revenue was $144 million in Q4 2023, an increase of 55% as compared to $92 million in Q4 2022. Revenue growth over the past year was due to growth in all three of WELL Health USA lines of business: Circle Medical, WISP and CRH. First, on CRH and RADAR, which we are now referring to as provider staffing, CRH closed out another successful year in 2023, while anesthesia continues to be a mainstay for CRH the midyear acquisition of CarePlus Management also added the complementary recruiting and staffing business, which operates under the name of RADAR health care providers.\nThe full integration and related synergies of these businesses are now complete, and we believe this acquisition will prove to be successful for years to come. Q4 is typically CRH's strongest quarter and this year's results were as expected. Overall, Q4 2023 revenue was up 79% versus Q4 of last year, while fiscal revenue was up 50%. Specifically, the CRH anesthesia revenue grew by 24% year-over-year in Q4 and 25% for the year, while the CRH O'Regan business was flat.\nThe rest of what is now known as WELL Health USA's growth was driven by the addition of provider staffing. As a reminder, provider staffing is a premier and trusted staffing and locum tenants business specializing in anesthesia. Provider staffing provides recruitment and placement services, along with temporary staffing to its national network of provider groups, hospitals and ASCs across over 30 states. Provider staffing was an important addition to the WELL USA family as its portfolio of services targeting the GI marketplace now includes three prongs. One, Hemorrhoid Banding with the company's Oregon Medical Device, which is the U.S.'s leading band ligator device, to anesthesia services for routine colonoscopies and of course, three provider staffing solutions. We look forward to adding more services to this GI-focused service bundle. And now on to our U.S. digital patient services businesses.\nFirst, Circle Medical. Circle Medical continues to successfully execute on its direct-to-consumer patient acquisition strategy, which resulted in a record quarter. Growth accelerated to Q4 to $29.9 million, representing 32% growth compared to the same quarter of the previous year, all organically driven. Patient volume grew from 422,000 to $563,000. Circle ended 2023 with year-over-year revenue growth of 39%. Circle's fourth quarter results also benefited from a onetime billing true-up at the end of the year from services provided in prior quarters.\nThe company is increasing its investment in R&D where it expects to double the head count this year with technical hires in its Montreal facility being a priority. Key focuses for 2024 will be mainly related to platform upgrades including the company's aggressive AI road map, which is quite exciting as Circle Medical is launching its own AI scribe and AI-powered physician copilot capabilities to support its own provider network workforce of over 300 providers.\nCircle has also entered into a partnership with the Mila Quebec AI Institute, giving it access to collaborate with the institute 1,200 AI researchers while retaining IP. Circle has also resumed state expansion for the first time in 2 years since the beginning of 2024, Circles launched virtual care in 4 new states, Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina and Ohio and is expecting to launch an additional 4 states by the end of Q1, bringing the total number of active states, 38.\nLooking ahead to 2024, Circle Medical is on track to match its previous year's revenue growth rate of over 30% year-over-year while maintaining EBITDA positive. And now a few words about WISP. I am pleased to report that WISP reported record revenue in Q4 with improved profitability, which also successfully completed its plan to launch 10 new products in 2023. From a cost optimization perspective, WISP did successfully renegotiated pricing with the pharmacy partners and is committed to more cost-effective nurse practitioner hiring on the provider team. We expect WISP to report record revenue again in Q1 with continued profitable growth as the business ramps up marketing spend and continues to lead into new product development with plans to launch its new fertility offering shortly.\nFinally, our SaaS and Technology Services businesses. SaaS and Technology Services revenues from our Platform Solutions group were $20.2 million in Q4 2023, a year-over-year increase of 60% and as compared to $12.6 million in Q4 2022, an increase of 27% as compared to $15.9 million in the prior quarter Q3 2023. The increase in revenue was due to a bounce back in our cybersecurity and data protection business in the fourth quarter as well as organic growth in our remaining SaaS and services platform business.\nLast year, well bolstered its cybersecurity portfolio with tuck-in acquisitions of Seek Into and Proact security, bringing on board seasoned cybersecurity professionals in the process and strengthening our ability to serve over 190 corporate and government customers across North America. These acquisitions are performing well, and we expect cybersecurity to have an improved overall year in 2024 as compared to 2023. In 2023, we announced that OceanMD signed a $38.5 million contract with British Columbia's Public Health Service Authority to provide an array of digital services such as eReferral, e-consult and e-orders to help further tech enable providers with best-in-class digital interoperability tools. Thus far, our implementation in BC has been proceeding as planned, and I'm pleased to announce that Go Live is expected in the first half of 2024, at which time, we will also start to receive high-margin license revenue from this relationship.\nOceanMD is already the dominant eReferral solution in the province of Ontario. In Q2 2023, we announced and OceanMD went live across Nova Scotia. And with the recent win in BC, we feel OceanMD has the potential to become the eReferral standard across the country. OceanMD is a key component of WELL platform and is emerging as a leader in patient engagement in e-referral solutions. Ocean's eReferral software allows primary care providers to send their request to specialists through the Ocean eReferral network instead of faxing, e-mailing or mailing, which makes surgical consult referrals easier and reduces wait times for patients.\nWe're pleased to report that Ocean delivered more than 876,000 eReferral in 2023. And a couple of weeks ago, we announced that -- thus far in the year, we're at 1.2 million eReferral in the last 12 months, demonstrating already significant growth and acceleration over the past year. This is a real achievement, and we're very proud of the Ocean team for making this positive impact in the Canadian health care ecosystem. In 2023, we launched WELL AI voice which has been a big hit with health care providers because of its ability to cut down on administrative time and increase patient engagement, giving physicians time back in their day. The adoption metrics of WELL AI voice are a testament to the value created for physicians.\nWELL AI voice has seamlessly integrated into 131,000 patient consultations in 2023 reclaiming time for clinicians that was previously lost to administrative tasks, while enriching patient care quality. WELL AI voice has been successfully rolled out to over 25 well-known clinics. Our continued expansion of WELL AI voice within our own clinic network demonstrates our dedication to leveraging our AI capabilities to also benefit WELL physicians as well as our broader clinic network.\nOverall, our technology platform services group continues to perform with the rollout of AI-based tools and achieving record sales in Q4. Lastly, our Platform Solutions group, which is under the leadership, now under the leadership of our COO, Amir Javidan, formed a dedicated public sector group to support large-scale health systems and care delivery networks that underpin the public sector. The objective of this group is to combine and deliver product offerings that are specifically suited for public sector's unique scale and requirements. If you'd like to learn more about this, please visit our new dedicated public sector website at WELL Health solutions. That's wellhealth.solutions as the URL.\nAnd now I'd like to provide some commentary on our partnership with HEALWELL AI. As you may remember, on October 1, we completed the transaction with MCI One Health, whereby well acquired the clinical assets from MCI and the remaining business of MCI was recapitalized and launched as HEALWELL AI, a company focused on AI and data science for preventative care. While it's currently the largest shareholder of HEALWELL with an option that would give WELL the control position in HEALWELL as defined on an IFRS financial reporting basis. WELL currently holds 22.7 million shares of HEALWELL, thereby representing 20.8% of the issued and outstanding voting securities of HEALWELL. WELL's call option gives WELL the right to acquire up to an additional approximately 30 million Class A subordinate voting shares and the same number of Class B multiple voting shares of the company.\nIf WELL exercises its option, WELL will have -- WELL over 40% ownership on an as-converted basis. We're extremely happy with the progress that HEALWELL team has made in such a short period of time. Since its launch, HEALWELL has raised approximately $29.5 million in convertible debt and equity funding, completed two acquisitions of Pentavere and intra-health made one minority investment in doctorly.\nMore recently, you may have seen the announcement that I've taken on the Chairman role at HEALWELL. I took on this role because the Boards of both WELL and HEALWELL felt that there is strong alignment between WELL and HEALWELL. I believe my appointment is also strategically very important for shareholders of both HEALWELL and WELL given the shared objective between the companies to create the most advanced and easy-to-use AI-inspired tools that can equip care providers with various copilots that can help them improve diagnosis of rare and chronic diseases, improve efficiency of their practice and improve patient health outcomes.\nWELL has also entered into a strategic alliance agreement with HEALWELL that enabled us to launch well AI decision support to our network of clinics and doctors. Given that some patients who have chronic or complex care needs may have hundreds or even thousands of pages of clinical notes, it's unrealistic for physicians to be expected to have a dynamic understanding of all patients' charts and detailed requirements. As such, we expect that over time, decision support will support physicians in numerous ways.\nMore recently, HEALWELL announced that it has signed a services agreement with both WELL Health USA and our U.S.-based subsidiary, Circle Medical, which expands its footprint in the United States and will enable U.S. health care providers with a suite of AI-powered preventative care solutions. HEALWELL Pentavere Division has partnered with WELL Health USA's CRH Medical to access anonymous U.S. health care data to gain insights in supporting patients who are dealing with inflammatory bowel disease and other GI conditions.\nThrough the agreement, Pentavere [ Starwood ] AI platform will analyze over 200,000 U.S. patients in a secure and compliant manner across 21 states to understand the real-world dynamics between biological prescribing and treatment outcomes. Meanwhile, HEALWELL's Care Health will integrate its proprietary AI platform with Circle Medical's electronic medical record system, expanding its footprint to over 30 U.S. states. Here's AI will screen for and flag for individual patients with whom the health care practitioner might consider for future investigation for potential earlier diagnosis of rare disease. We believe HEALWELL can be one of the most consequential AI health care companies in the country and also with global appeal, given its partnership with WELL and given the technology it has already acquired and developed.\nHEALWELL's ability to unlock insights from data that inform the creation of AI-powered physician co-pilots will be very key moving forward in an industry that badly needs to support its care providers better. Before we take questions, I'd like to provide some additional color on our Q1 2024 expectations. Despite our bullish annual look for 2024, we're expecting some normal seasonal weakness in the first quarter. Q1 has typically been the weakest quarter for CRH and its anesthesia business due to payer mix shifts and the renewal of patient deductibles coinciding with year-end.\nWe're also expecting Circle Medical revenues to decrease from Q4 and 2023 to 2024 as there were some onetime items in Circle Medical's Q4 results that won't be repeated in Q1. In addition, our cybersecurity revenues can be lumpy and our strong results in the SaaS and technology business aren't likely to be repeated in Q1. In terms of our adjusted EBITDA, due to the seasonal and onetime revenue factors in Q4 2023, we expect our Q1 adjusted EBITDA will not reach the same level as Q4 2023. Furthermore, the positive results from our cost optimization and staff restructuring efforts will begin to materialize until the second quarter due to these factors, we expect a sequential decline in our adjusted EBITDA from Q4 2023 to Q1 2024. Nonetheless, we're expecting continued revenue and EBITDA growth in Q2 and into the back half of 2024.\nIn summary, we are very pleased with our financial performance in 2023 and look forward to delivering strong results again in 2024. Our outlook remains very positive. Hence, I'm confident in our upgraded annual guidance. We have many tailwinds driving growth in the business, and we have a committed and disciplined team to ensure we can deliver on our objectives.\nFinally, I want to thank you all for joining us on this call and thank our shareholders and investors for their continued support. The capital markets have been very supportive of our vision and have provided us with the funding needed to pursue our goals. I would also like to thank WELL's senior management team and all our employees and contractors for their tremendous effort, and for creating a strong and inclusive culture that has helped us be recently independently certified as a Great Place to Work by the Great Place to Work Institute of Canada. This is a fully independent process. And as such, certification is a reflection of the company's strong commitment to creating a positive and progressive workplace culture. As per usual, I would also like to thank our team, health care providers and frontline workers who provide unbelievable patient care every single day. They remind us why we are here and we are here to support them.\nAnd with that, we'd be very pleased to take some questions. Operator?"

My name is Chantal, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Welltower Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions) Thank you. Matt McQueen, General Counsel. You may begin.\n\nMatthew Grant McQueen\n\nExecutive VP, General Counsel & Corporate Secretary, Welltower Inc.\n\nThank you, and good morning. As a reminder, certain statements made during this call may be deemed forward-looking statements in the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Although Welltower believes any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, the company can give no assurances that its projected results will be attained. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in the company's filings with the SEC.\nAnd with that, I'll hand the call over to Shankh for his remarks.\n\nShankh S. Mitra\n\nCEO, CIO & Director, Welltower Inc.\n\nThank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. I'll review high-level business trends and describe our capital allocation priorities before handing the call over to John, who will detail the operational trends and provide more details on the operating platform that he is building.\nOur total revenue is up 29% year-over-year, driven by both organic revenue growth and contribution from significant capital deployment activity over the last 18 months. On a same-store basis, our senior housing operating portfolio revenue is up 11.5% year-over-year, driven by a 5% occupancy growth and a 4.5% REVPOR growth. All this translated into a 15.4% same-store NOI growth in Q2. Our annual EBITDA is back above $2 billion. Annualized in-place SHOP NOI is at $895 million. Though shy of $923 million of pre-pandemic numbers, our revenue has surpassed pre-pandemic levels.\nHowever, I'm not happy with these results, which I would characterize mediocre at best. Why? Because the size of our portfolio is much bigger today, given the significant amount of capital deployment over the last 18 months and yet our quarterly results are not reflecting the cash flow that this portfolio is capable of generating. I'll give you a few things to reflect on.\nFirst, we have about 120 senior living -- senior housing properties that are generating negative cash flow today. In other words, if we just shut down these buildings, our earnings would be significantly higher. Clearly, we would not do such a thing as they were recently developed or going through a value and repositioning program. Hence, the timing mismatch. Second, while I don't like to fix it on short-term trends and instead focus on long-term prospects of the business, I'll offer a few observations on the second quarter.\nWe started the quarter with results coming in better than expected, only to get hilt simultaneously by multiple challenges primarily related to another COVID spike during the last couple of weeks of June. Only this time, we didn't see it coming as the testing requirements have been lowered in recent months, particularly for those residents who are not experiencing symptoms.\nIn instances, while few residents or team members develop symptoms in an entire building, would be tested only to find out many asymptomatic residents and staff actually were COVID-positive. This created some disruption to move-ins, but particularly impactful to the use of agency labor in June.\nOur operators are walking through as we speak and made very good progress in July. Let me dig into some recent trends even a bit more. From a demand standpoint, we always see first half of July as 2 last weeks, similar to the last weeks of December as families celebrate 4th of July weekend and don't usually move parents and grandparents in. This July, we lost an additional week. And as a result, almost a whole month was shut from a move-in perspective before we gain significant traction later in the month with tour activities returning to the levels experienced in June.\nWe and our operators have a few theories of why that might be the case. One, the hyper positivity rate of COVID over 20%. Despite people on a reporting to government, families know from home testing they're COVID positive and are delaying move-ins as they wait for this wave to subside. And number two, travel. Summer travel has surged as families took advantage of looser COVID restrictions. Again, I would describe this as our conjecture because we don't know for sure. But we are clearly seeing broad-based demand recovery continues, particularly towards the second half of the month in terms of leads and tours, which led to a recent rebound in move-ins across the portfolio over the last couple of weeks.\nOn the cost side, it is important that you understand the progress we made on the agency labor. In the U.S., most of our operators are decreased from June to July, resulting largely from a favorable net hiring trends. The July books have not closed yet, we're expecting a decline in agency labor expense in high-single digit from month of June.\nIn terms of net hiring, our operators have continued to make significant momentum with July increase alone in headcount nearly equal to the net hires of past 6 months of the year combined. As a result, we're already starting to see benefit of this trend, which should reduce the dependence on agency labor in the second half of the year.\nThe downside of high-frequency data is that you get a lot of noise. And I strongly believe that's what you're seeing in the numbers today, a lot of noise. I encourage my team and will encourage you not to confuse any short-term high-frequency noise whether good or bad as a signal and project that into the future prospect of the business.\nFor a few quarters, I've been talking about the run rate earnings or the true earnings part of this portfolio being significantly different from our current reported earnings. Clearly, some of the anticipated second half growth has slipped into the next year, but this should only be a timing mismatch. As we focus on '23 and '24, I continue to believe that this earnings part will shine through.\nBefore I move on to the capital allocation priorities, let me make a comment on ProMedica. When we bought HCR ManorCare portfolio out of bankruptcy, we did not outsource our underwriting to rating agencies. Clearly, there was no way for us to predict a global pandemic or a day when almost every hospital system in the country would lose money similar to what happened in Q1 of this year because of COVID.\nWe got comfortable because our basis of $57,000 per skilled nursing bed, we saw very minimal risk of pharma and capital loss, which is at the core of how we think about risk. Of all the structuring belts and whistles aside, which we're very proud of, we fundamentally believe investment basis not cash flow in a given building at a given point in time determines investment success. Having said that, the ProMedica team has been able to make reduced agency labor almost by half over the last 4 months and significantly narrowed their operating losses.\nWe have below-market basis and thus, below market rent here. I remain very comfortable with our rent and longer-term expected IRR from this investment that we discussed with you when we did this deal 4 years ago. Turning to the capital deployment. I cannot overstate how favorable of an environment we find ourselves in today. During the second quarter, our off-market, privately negotiated transaction machine kept humming, having deployed an additional $1.1 billion of capital. Today, there is definite stress in the lending environment given the significant rate and credit volatility and increasing recession talk.\nCap rates are going up across the board and most institutional capital is waiting to see where the chips fall. We're seeing many high-quality opportunities, and we think the environment will only get more favorable as Fed continues to raise rate at a rapid clip. Our pipeline remains robust, having replenished after all of our Q2 and Q3 closings. Our fundamental investment thesis remains intact.\nOne, we need to buy at a favorable basis relative to replacement cost; and two, we need to be able to add value through our platform. We're not spread-investing deal junkies and instead remains laser focused on total return or unlevered IRR. I continue to believe this year will be a record year for Welltower from a capital deployment standpoint. Cost of capital has surged for everybody, including governments and access to capital remains very sparse for most people. In this environment, we remain in a very favorable capital position with $2-plus billion of equity capital that is raised but not settled and almost full availability of our $4 billion line.\nSellers who did not like our price 6 months ago are realizing that glossy broker package and nonbinding LOI are not cash in a bank. This environment reinforces the value of a counterparty like Welltower, which always acts on a very simple principle. We say what we do and we do what we say. And in that vein, as our long-term investors have come to expect from us, we exercise utmost discipline on every transaction we look at, large or small and will not chase any deal.\nAs we have said in the recent past, price is the price, and we only act in a manner that creates long-term value for -- part share for our owners. With respect to capital deployment over the last 18 months, some of you have asked me if I'm satisfied with the performance of these properties. In many cases -- in the case of many of these acquisitions, including some larger ones, the answer is no. The same-store challenge that I have described above are accentuated in many non-same-store properties, which are being repositioned through operator changes.\nHowever, I do believe that we have turned the corner as we approach the completion of our operator transition and system integration for the COVID class of acquisitions. We should see significant progress from these properties as we enter next year. Please recall, we make investment decisions based on long-term IRR with an exit cap rate going up every single year from the duration of the ownership. And we feel strongly about achieving those return targets as we have discussed with you.\nAs frustrating as near-term challenges of operator transition might be for reported earnings and trust me, I share those frustrations with you, we have to do what's right for long-term interest of our owners. I will give you 2 examples. Vintage and Gracewell, 2 of the most ill-fated HCN acquisition from many months ago. Despite some of the most coveted locations and CapEx plans, these assets did not live up to our expectations. We finally pulled the plug over last 12 months, frankly, because we're not permitted to do so earlier.\nOur Gracewell assets were transferred to Care UK and the Vintage assets were mostly transferred to Oakmont with one each to Kisco and Cogir. Oakmont has already made incredible progress with the first tranche of the asset they received last fall, with occupancy up 13%, and I believe you will see this repeated in the most recent tranche as well. Care UK is having similar success with Gracewell assets taking occupancy above 80%. And I believe they will be stabilized or get close to it in 2023.\nWe made similar decisions for our other properties, which come with some short-term gain. But as we capital allocators strive every day to create per share value by compounding over a long period of time. While we hope near-term priorities do not conflict with those long term, practically speaking, we often encounter situations where those time horizons diverge. And it is critical for our investors to understand that at these crossroads, we'll always follow the path to long-term value creation at the expense of short-term gains.\nThe good news is that all of these, as my partner, John Burkart, would say, is baked in the cake. With that, I'll hand the call over to John, who will describe to you perhaps the most exciting set of initiatives that will transform the business as we know today and creates tremendous value for our residents, team members, operating partners and most importantly, our shareholders. John?\n\nJohn F. Burkart\n\nExecutive VP & COO, Welltower Inc.\n\nThank you, Shankh. My comments today will touch upon the performance of our operating business and provide additional color regarding our vision for senior housing as well as an update on our platform initiatives. Starting with our medical office portfolio. In the second quarter, our outpatient medical business sequentially increased occupancy by 30 basis points and delivered 2.5% same-store NOI growth over the prior year's quarter. We continue to see strong retention rates over 89% in the quarter, good demand and rising new lease rates.\nNow turning to our senior housing operating platform portfolio. The recovery in the sector continues. As Shankh mentioned, revenue in our same-store portfolio accelerated to 11.5% in the second quarter compared to the prior year's quarter. All 3 regions showed good revenue growth led by the U.S. and U.K. with growth of 13.1%, 14.7%, respectively. The revenue for the quarter was driven by a 500 basis point increase in occupancy and another quarter of healthy rate growth.\nSequentially, the portfolio increased occupancy 100 basis points during a period in which sequentially average occupancy has historically been slightly negative. While expenses grew at a rate of 10.5%, our operators continue to control export or expense per occupied room, which only grew at a rate of 3.5% in the second quarter on a year-over-year basis. And as Shankh indicated, we're encouraged by recent trends in terms of agency hiring and new hiring, which we believe should drive a deceleration in the second half expense growth.\nDespite short-term challenges driven by COVID, the tight labor market and inflationary pressures, the portfolio delivered 15.4% year-over-year same-store NOI growth in the period, the second highest in the company's history with the U.S. portfolio generating over 20% same-store NOI growth. Going forward, we expect the portfolio to deliver outside NOI growth over a multiyear period with strengthening supply-demand backdrop compounded by our efforts to optimize the business, which I'll get to shortly.\nRegarding the overall market, the traffic this summer has been influenced by COVID in various ways. For example, the traffic was very good in June and then fell significantly as expected for the 4th of July weekend and continue to remain low until it accelerated in the last couple of weeks of July. We had total July traffic was about equal to total June traffic. We expect to increase traffic in the later part of July to lead to increased move-ins in August. The average occupancy for the portfolio in July was up over 40 basis points in the same-store portfolio.\nI also want to quickly comment on recent management transitions within the SHO portfolio. As we make adjustments to our operators' portfolios and the related assets are in transition, we appropriately remove them from the same-store portfolio as they tend to underperform early in the transition and subsequently outperformed later in the transition which can create noise in the same-store portfolio performance. This is very similar to removing an asset for full renovation.\nTransitions take substantial amounts of time from the point of notice to the actual transition of management which negatively impacts staffing, sales leads and other operational aspects of the asset. The challenges the new operator faces upon takeover are significant. However, over time, they get resolved. And of course, the assets performance improves over the pre-transition baseline, which is the purpose of the transition to begin with. The fact that we have 59 assets in transition is meaningful and that management is willing to take short-term earnings pain for improved performance in the future.\nIf we had not removed transition assets from the same-store portfolio, our year-over-year NOI growth for the quarter would have been 14.9%. Bottom line, strategic transitions are undoubtedly worth it, and they can drive significant value despite creating near-term noise for the same-store portfolio. Shifting to an update on the operating platform. Previously, I mentioned the opportunity to fundamentally change the growth potential of this business by creating a full-scale operating platform and bringing operational excellence to our senior housing portfolio.\nIn terms of industry life cycle, I would place the senior housing business in the infancy phase, but rapidly transitioning into the growth phase. This is very similar to the multifamily business years ago, whose transformation I witnessed firsthand. Businesses that are in infancy phase of the industry life cycle focus on effectiveness, which is essential. Without it, the business would not be able to exist long term.\nAs an industry transitions from the infancy phase to the growth phase continuing to remain effective as the core objective is essential. However, the winners focus on operational excellence, including efficiency. The analogy that I've used is the diner business of the 1950s. To survive and thrive, you had to serve a good meal, a good burger, fries and shake in the case of the McDonald Brothers. However, to grow as the industry moved from its infancy to growth phase, a focus on operational excellence was imperative, including an obsessive focus on efficiency, which is what Ray Kroc did when he franchised McDonald's.\nThe senior housing operators faced many small business challenges, including the inability to recruit and retain top talent and key functions from technology and data analytics to process and facilities management due to their size and inability to compete from a compensation perspective. Additionally, the fee-based structure limits the economic incentive to fully invest in optimizing the business as an owner operator would.\nFor example, if a fee manager has paid 5% of revenues, the most they would logically spend to collect $1 of revenue is $0.05, whereas owner operators would theoretically invest $0.99 to collect $1. As you all know, we have worked to change this unfavorable incentive structure through our aligned RIDEA 3.0 contracts. And we are now working on our next generation of contracts that will provide Welltower with a greater ability to help address senior housing operators small business challenges. These challenges are across the board, including basic functions to illustrate in a relatively simple areas such as billing.\nIn the 2 reviews we performed, we identified that Care revenue was underbilled by 25% or more, meaning that the necessary quality of care was provided to the resident. However, they were under billed. Other challenges are much greater, including keeping up with modern consumer expectations such as building-wide, high-speed internet connectivity, identifying and integrating quality technology systems and creating and delivering real time, insightful and actionable reporting to improve operational results.\nFocusing on operational excellence is more than a digital transformation. It's about people, processes, data and technology, recognizing that everything starts with people. Our residents living at our communities, the employees serving those residents and the operators leading the effort. We start by focusing on the customer experience and the employee experience and optimizing the various processes. Then we evaluate the data that may -- that we may leverage to draw meaningful insight into the business in a way that improves the experience of the various stakeholders.\nFinally, we implement cutting-edge technology to simplify and automate the processes as we will provide real-time actionable, insightful information, improving the customer and employee experience while optimizing results. This isn't simply about buying the latest software. It's about fundamentally transforming the business. Over the years, many businesses have transformed from buying books to used cars to buying homes and finding vacation rentals.\nDigital transformations have fundamentally changed these businesses and improved the overall experience. One of the key imperatives of operational excellence is the recognition that data is the asset. There is no entity in this space better positioned to leverage data than Welltower as we are effectively building the operating platform to improve the overall experience on what we call Alpha, our data analytics platform that has been developed over the last 6 years.\nWelltower will improve the customer and employee experience and create shareholder value through leading transformation of the business. I have gone from full immersion and observation to planning and now action mode. I will not give away all the details of my future playbook, but I will say the following. We are moving very fast. Several recent highlights include forming an internal multidisciplinary team of experts focused on improving the senior housing operations in Q2, hiring a Chief Technology Officer in Q2 to lead the technology aspect of the operating platform, completing the implementation of Welltower's ERP last week, which is central to this effort.\nAnd frankly, I want to thank the Welltower team that executed this massive project with great speed and excellent execution. Initiating a data analytics pilot on the correct information that we have available with an expected rollout over the next 6 months, this step alone will enable us to start driving value. Finally, creating the sales force automation plan with expectations to launch a pilot in early 2023. We have numerous other modules in the works and we'll update as appropriate.\nAlthough this is a huge effort, Welltower is uniquely positioned to execute it faster than historically possible. Our strategy is to leverage existing quality modules and only create new modules where they don't exist or where they give us a strategic advantage, such as our revenue management module, which we're developing. Another unique benefit that Welltower has relates to the number of top quality operators in our portfolio. We are separating the pilots of the modules into parallel initiatives, each with a different operator, which will minimize the potential delays that can be caused by a lack of employee bandwidth or overall fatigue and have slowed down other transformations. Ultimately, as we perfect each module, we will then rapidly roll it out to the broader group. This business transformation will continue to deepen and widen the moat Welltower has built while improving the overall experience of all stakeholders.\nI'll now turn the call over to Tim.\n\nTimothy G. McHugh\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Welltower Inc.\n\nThank you, John. My comments today will focus on our second quarter 2022 results. The performance of our triple net investment by each quarter, our capital activity, balance sheet liquidity update; and finally, our outlook for the third quarter. Welltower reported second quarter net income attributable to common stockholders of $0.20 per diluted share and normalized funds from operations of $0.86 per diluted share, which included $17 million of private relief funds from the Department of Health and Human Services, approximately $11 million or $0.02 per share more than what was assumed in our initial guide for the quarter.\nThis quarter representing our second consecutive quarter with a year-over-year normalized FFO growth since the start of the pandemic, a positive 8.9% or 7.7% when normalized on HHS funds received and year-over-year changes in FX rates. We also reported our second consecutive quarter of positive total portfolio same-store NOI growth of 8.7% year-over-year growth.\nTurning to our triple net lease portfolios. As a reminder, our triple-net lease portfolio coverage and occupancy stats reported a quarter in arrears. So these statistics reflect the trailing 12 months ending March 31, 2022. In our senior housing triple-net portfolio, same-store NOI increased 9.9% year-over-year, driven by improvements in rent collections and leases currently on cash recognition and the early impact of rental increases tied to CPI.\nTrailing 12-month EBITDAR coverage increased 0.01x to 0.83x in the quarter. Next, our long-term post-acute portfolio grew same-store NOI by positive 2.8% year-over-year and trailing 12-month EBITDAR coverage is 1.31x.\nAnd lastly, health systems, which is comprised of our ProMedica Senior Care joint venture with the ProMedica Health system, which had same-store NOI growth of positive 2.75% year-over-year and trailing 12-month EBITDAR coverage was negative 0.29x as operation continued to be impacted by high agency utilization in the first quarter.\nTurning to capital market activity. We continue to enhance our balance sheet strength and position the company and capitalize on our robust and highly visible pipeline of capital deployment opportunities by utilizing our ATM program to efficiently fund those near-term transaction. At the start of the second quarter, we sold 18 million shares via forward sale agreement at initial weighted average price of approximately $87.67 per share for expected gross proceeds of $1.6 billion.\nWe currently have approximately 22.5 million shares remaining unsettled, which are expected to generate future proceeds of $2.0 billion. Taken together, our unsettled equity proceeds includes some committed OP units on pipeline deals and $257 million of expected property dispositions and loan payoff proceeds, totaled $2.3 billion in equity capital, providing ample capacity to fund our current investment pipeline.\nDuring the quarter, we closed on an amended $4 billion unsecured revolving line of credit, along with an upsized term facility comprised of a USD 1 billion term loan and a CAD 250 million term loan. At quarter end, when factoring cash and restricted cash balances, our liquidity position exceeded the $4 billion of borrowing capacity on our line of credit. And when combined with the previous mentioned $2.3 billion of unsettled equity proceeds and expected disposition proceeds, we remain in a very strong liquidity position.\nLastly, moving to our third quarter outlook. Last night, we provided an outlook for the third quarter of net income attributable to the common stockholders per diluted share of $0.12 to $0.17. And normalized FFO per share of $0.82 to $0.87 or $0.845 at the midpoint. This guidance includes $7 million with HHS funds expected to be received in the third quarter.\nExcluding HHS funds, guidance represented a $0.005 increase at the midpoint from 2Q normalized FFO. The $0.005 increase composed of $0.025 from incremental SHO NOI growth and SHO investment activity and $0.01 from performance across the rest of our investment segments and from lower sequential G&A costs. This is offset by $0.03 of higher floating rate interest costs and unfavorable FX rates.\nUnderlying with FFO guidance is estimated third quarter total portfolio year-over-year same-store NOI growth of 7% to 9%, driven by subsegment growth of outpatient medical, 1.75% to 2.75%, long-term post acute of 2.5% to 3.5%, health systems of 2.75%, senior housing triple net of 5% to 6%, and finally, senior housing operating growth of 15% to 20%, driven by year-over-year revenue growth of 10%.\nUnderlying this revenue growth is an expectation for approximately 400 basis points of year-over-year average occupancy growth and continued robust rate growth. We continue to be pleased with the momentum of the top line recovery in our senior housing operating portfolio, driven by a combination of rate and occupancy growth. As I remarked last quarter, as we realize the recovery in our core portfolio, we have made the conscious decision to steadily allocate capital to distress under-operated and often initially diluted properties, along with high-quality development projects. While this capital allocation is the effect of offsetting some of our core growth today, it was substantially amplified in years to come.\nAnd with that, I'll hand the call back over to Shankh.\n\nShankh S. Mitra\n\nCEO, CIO & Director, Welltower Inc.\n\nThank you, Jim. If I may distract you all from the short-term noise and focus on the main drivers of long-term earnings and cash flow per share growth, there are really 4 large buckets that we must pay attention to: occupancy, rates, labor cost and external growth.\nIn 2021, whenever we're hit by a massive COVID wave, it felt as though we are taking one step forward and two steps back in terms of occupancy, rates and labor costs. Thankfully, the health impact of COVID has been getting more mild and the psyche of the population has significantly improved. Now we are taking 2 steps forward and one step back in terms of occupancy and labor cost and it appears from the July trends that we're making that one extra step back forward very quickly. So COVID impacts are getting less pronounced and rebounds are getting quicker as we learn how to live with COVID.\nDespite the reported issues of agency labor, the team member count in our communities has grown significantly offlet and we have not seen any let up -- though we have not seen any let up of the cost of labor, there is no question that we have seen the availability of labor increase meaningfully offlet. The portfolio has almost the same net hiring in July as we had in the first 6 months of the year combined.\nThough our operators have had success in net hiring members over the last few months, as you can see from the case studies on Slide 7 and 8, it appears that the labor market is finally on demand from the significant success of hiring trends in July. Assuming these trends continue, this bodes very well for agency labor cost as we get a second half of the year. And where we continue to make the largest strides is through pricing power. The recent COVID spikes have not in any way dulled our operators' ability to push through strong rates. What is particularly encouraging is the street rates, which are up from high-single digits all the way up to 15%, 20% in case of some large operators.\nGiven the sharp acceleration in growth of the senior population and plummeting new supply of few projects penciling for developers today, our confidence in driving occupancy and rate growth for the next few years continue to strengthen. As for external growth opportunities, our prospects, which have been very good are only getting better, the willingness of owners to transact has grown over the last 2 years as they struggled with COVID-related challenges and debt maturity.\nAnd now with recent surge in borrowing costs and tighter lending standards that are keeping many bars at bay. If we overlay all this with how John is fundamentally transforming our business, I have not been more excited of the future prospect of our firm. We know we need to translate all of this into significant higher earnings run rate and cash flow per share and our team, which thinks and acts like long-term owners is hyper focused on that mission. With that, we'll open the call up for questions."

(Operator Instructions) Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions)\nI would now like to turn the conference over to your speaker for today, Quintin Lai, Vice President, Investor Relations. You may begin.\n\nQuintin J. Lai\n\nVP of Corporate Development, Strategy & IR, West Pharmaceutical Services, Inc.\n\nThank you, Towanda. Good morning, and welcome to West's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2021 Conference Call. We issued our financial results this morning, and the release has been posted in the Investors section on the company's website located at westpharma.com.\nThis morning, CEO, Eric Green; and CFO, Bernard Birkett, will review our financial results, provide an update on our business and present an update on our financial outlook for the full year 2022. There is a slide presentation that accompanies today's call, and a copy of that presentation is available on the Investors section of our website.\nOn Slide 4 is our safe harbor statement. Statements made by management on this call and in the accompanying presentation contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of U.S. federal securities laws. These statements are based on our beliefs and assumptions current expectations, estimates and forecasts. The company's future results are influenced by many factors beyond the control of the company. Actual results could differ materially from past results as well as those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statement made here. Please refer to today's press release as well as any other disclosures made by the company regarding the risks to which it is subject including our 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports.\nDuring today's call, management will make reference to non-GAAP financial measures, including organic sales growth, adjusted operating profit, adjusted operating profit margin and adjusted diluted EPS. Reconciliations and limitations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable financial results prepared to conformed GAAP and are provided in this morning's earnings release.\nI now turn the call over to West CEO and President, Eric Green.\n\nEric M. Green\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, West Pharmaceutical Services, Inc.\n\nThank you, Quintin, and good morning. and thanks for joining us today. We are excited to discuss our 2021 results and outlook for 2022. We will start on Slide 5.\nWest delivered a remarkable year of success. As I reflect on the year, 3 things stand out to me. First, our purpose. We serve to improve patient lives, and we understand the criticality of our role in the containment and delivery of life-saving and life-changing medicines, including the battle against COVID-19.\nOur team members have rallied together with great strength and resolve to meet the accelerated customer demand. I want to acknowledge these incredible efforts and say thank you.\nSecond, our proven market-led strategy. We have continued to meet shifting market and customer needs with unique value propositions across our business segments. This is evident in the continued strength of our financial performance in 2021.\nLastly, trust. Customers trust West. As the global leader, customers come to West knowing that we will deliver superior value through our high-quality products and solutions. And we remain focused on delivering value to all our stakeholders on a sustainable basis and doing our part to support the health care industry.\nAs highlighted on Slide 6, 2021 was an exceptional year of sales and margin expansion driven by strong demand in our base business and accelerated demand for components associated with COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics. We ended the year with 28% organic sales growth in the fourth quarter. And adjusting for COVID-related sales, our base business grew by mid-teens organically.\nOur Proprietary Products segment led the way with 37% organic sales growth, and all of this was fueled by high-value products, resulting in impressive gross and operating margin expansion for the quarter.\nLooking ahead, we are well positioned with the right growth strategy around execute, innovate and grow. Our committed order book is at an all-time high. We continue to realize the benefits of the globalization of our operating model and continued capital investments to support the increase in demand driven by the attractive end markets.\nTurning to Slide 7. In addition to our financial momentum, West has several other notable accomplishments in 2021. We shipped over 45 billion components touching billions of patient lives. This was done with the continued safety of our team members as top priority and the importance of ensuring the continuity of supply for our customers.\nAs scientific and technical leaders in the industry, we continue to broaden insights with our expertise through West knowledge center, webinars, published articles and technical presentations. We launched 5 product extensions that continue to bring additional value to our customers. And we donated over $2.5 million, but more importantly, over 3,600 hours -- volunteer hours were donated by team members to help our local communities with the greatest needs.\nAs we move to Slide 8, a we strive to be stewards of a sustainable future by factoring environmental considerations into every aspect of our business. In 2021, we expanded our ESG transparency reporting by aligning with the task force for climate-related financial disclosure recommendations. This includes reducing energy dependencies and lessening emission production through renewable and greener energy, developing more carbon-friendly products and actively engaging with stakeholders to seek out opportunities to have an impact on climate.\nAligned with our focus to improving patient lives across the globe through our products, we remain strongly committed to creating a healthier environment with efforts that will have a positive impact on our communities and future generations.\nTurning to Slide 9 and the recent announcement of our collaboration with Corning. As you look across biotech and pharma companies' drug pipelines, there is a growing need to provide system solutions to support increasingly more sensitive and complex molecules. And with that comes a changing and increasing regulatory environment that are setting the high-bar requirements for performance data on combination of products at the system level. These regulatory changes are driving drug manufacturers to look to West to reduce risk by specifically specifying a system of packaging rather than individual components.\nWe're excited to have Corning as a key collaborator as we expand our HVP value proposition to lead the industry from components to a truly integrated system that couples elastomer and glass. In response to our customers, this exclusive supply and technology agreement with Corning includes significant investment in R&D and capital for installed manufacturing capacity to expand Corning's Ballard glass technology.\nBy combining West industry-leading NovaPure components with Daikyo's FluroTec coating technology and Corning's Valor Glass and Velocity vials, the collaboration will enable new advanced pharmaceutical packaging solutions. We believe that an integrated system of -- glass under a single drug master file is the next level of high-value products.\nOur initial focus is addressing the need for complete system offering. And in time, we will offer a broad range of systems from vials to prefilled syringes to cartridges.\nAs we enter in 2022, we are building on the positive momentum we generated in 2021. We are introducing full year 2022 financial guidance that assumes approximately 10% organic sales, led by strong HVP sales and another strong year of both gross and operating profit margin expansion well in excess of 100 basis points.\nThis guidance includes a substantial acceleration in our R&D efforts as we enter this new era of integrated systems. And with a robust book of committed orders, we see momentum in 2022 and continuing into 2023. As such, we expect to add more capital expansion plans for additional HVP capacity to stay ahead of our customers' demand. We expect these projects to be completed throughout the year and ready for 2023 production.\nBefore I turn the call over to Bernard to review our financial results in detail, I want to revisit our long-term financial construct. For the past few years, we have set our long-term financial construct as annual organic sales growth of 6% to 8%, led by HVP sales and annual operating profit margin expansion of 100 basis points per year.\nOver the past 5 years, we've had an annual organic sales CAGR of 13% and annual operating profit margin expansion of 240 basis points per year. 5 years ago, Biologics was our smallest market unit. Today, biologics is our largest market unit with customers from emerging biotech to large biopharma and coming to West and our partner, Daikyo, which is reinforced by our strong participation rate in recently approved new molecular entities in the U.S. and also in Europe.\nAs we look to the future, we see continued demand growth for our HVP products as we launch a new level of HVP's integrated systems. We are updating our long-term construct to annual sales growth of 7% to 9%. And we continue to expect to expand operating margins by 100 basis points per year over the next few years.\nNow I'll turn it over to our CFO, Bernard Birkett, who will provide more detail on our financial performance. Bernard?\n\nBernard J. Birkett\n\nSenior VP & CFO, West Pharmaceutical Services, Inc.\n\nThank you, Eric, and good morning. So let's review the numbers in more detail. We'll first look at Q4 2021 revenues and profits where we saw continued strong sales and EPS growth led by strong revenue performance in each of our proprietary market units.\nI will take you through the margin growth we saw in the quarter as well as some balance sheet takeaways. And finally, we will review our 2022 guidance.\nFirst up, Q4. Our financial results are summarized on Slide 10 and the reconciliation of non-U.S. GAAP measures are described in Slides 19 to 22.\nWe recorded net sales of $730.8 million in the quarter, representing organic sales growth of 28.3%. COVID-related net revenues are estimated to have been approximately $124 million in the quarter. These net revenues include our assessment of components associated with vaccines, treatment and diagnosis of COVID-19 patients, offset by lower sales to customers affected by lower volumes due to the pandemic.\nLooking at Slide 11. Proprietary products sales grew organically by 36.8% in the quarter. High-value products, which made up approximately 74% of proprietary product sales in the quarter grew double digits and had solid momentum across all of our market units in Q4.\nLooking at the performance of the market units. The biologics market unit delivered strong double-digit growth led by NovaPure and Westar components. The generics and pharma market units also experienced double-digit growth led by sales of FluroTec and Westar components. And Contract Manufacturing organic net sales declined by 2.1% in the fourth quarter primarily driven by lower sales of health care-related medical devices.\nWe continue to see improvement in gross profit. We recorded $300.6 million in gross profit, $89.5 million or 42.4% above Q4 of last year. And our gross profit margin of 41.1% was a 470 basis point expansion from the same period last year.\nWe saw improvement in adjusted operating profit with $189.2 million recorded this quarter compared to $119.1 million in the same period last year for a 58.9% increase. Our adjusted operating profit margin of 25.9% was a 540 basis point increase from the same period last year.\nFinally, adjusted diluted EPS grew 52% for Q4. Excluding stock-based compensation tax benefit of $0.06 in Q4, EPS grew by approximately 58%. So let's review the growth drivers in both revenue and profit.\nOn Slide 12, we show the contributions to sales growth in the quarter. Volume and mix contributed $153 million or 26.4 percentage points of growth, including approximately $78 million of incremental volume driven by COVID-19-related net demand. Sales price increases contributed $11.3 million or 1.9 percentage points of growth.\nLooking at margin performance. Slide 13 shows our consolidated gross profit margin of 41.1% for Q4 2021, up from 36.4% in Q4 2020. Proprietary products fourth quarter gross profit margin of 46.3% was 460 basis points above the margin achieved in the fourth quarter of 2020.\nThe key drivers for the continued improvement in Proprietary Products gross profit margin were favorable mix of products sold driven by growth in high-value products; production efficiencies; sales price increases partially offset by increased overhead costs, inclusive of compensation.\nContract Manufacturing fourth quarter gross profit margin of 16.5% was 70 basis points below the margin achieved in the fourth quarter of 2020. The decrease in margin is largely attributed to increased raw material costs and a mix of products sold.\nNow let's look at our balance sheet and review how we've done in terms of generating more cash. On Slide 14, we have listed some key cash flow metrics. Operating cash flow was $584 million for the year, an increase of $111.5 million compared to the same period last year, a 23.6% increase. Operating cash flow in the period was adversely impacted by our working capital increase as well as an increase in tax payments.\nIn 2021, we spent over $253 million on capital expenditures, a 45% increase over 2020. The majority of the incremental CapEx has been leveraged to increase our high-value product manufacturing capacity within our existing facilities. We expanded capacity at 13 existing sites with 13 major facility modifications and over 400 pieces of equipment, all while keeping pace with the growing demand.\nWe have continued to increase capacity at our HVP sites in the U.S., Germany, Ireland and in Singapore. And we have been able to leverage our existing asset base to support proprietary products manufacturing. For example, our Williamsport, Pennsylvania site, formerly a contract manufacturing site, will be transformed with over half its manufacturing capacity to support proprietary products with elastomer mixing and batch off line. And this leverages the close proximity to our HVP site at Jersey Shore.\nAs we flex our global infrastructure with the phased capacity expansions, we are well positioned for the continued growth in 2022.\nWorking capital of approximately $1.1 billion increased by $277.6 million from 2020 primarily due to higher accounts receivable from our increased sales, higher inventory levels and an increase in our cash position. Our cash balance at December 31 of $762.6 million was $147.1 million higher in our December 2020 balance. The increase in cash is primarily due to our strong operating results in the period, offset by our share repurchase program and higher CapEx.\nTurning to guidance. Slide 15 provides a high-level summary. Full year 2022 sales guidance will be in a range of $3.05 billion to $3.075 billion. There is an estimated headwind of $70 million based on current foreign exchange rates. We expect organic sales growth to be approximately 10%. This comprises a mid-teen growth in our proprietary business. The forecast includes mid-teen growth in our base business and mid-teen growth in our net COVID-related revenues.\nFor Contract Manufacturing, we are forecasting low to mid-single-digit negative growth in 2022. We do expect contract manufacturing to return to growth in 2023.\nWe expect our full year 2022 reported diluted EPS guidance to be in a range of $9.20 to $9.35. Also, our CapEx guidance is $380 million for the year.\nThere are some key elements I want to bring your attention to as you review our guidance. Estimated FX headwind on EPS has an impact of approximately $0.21 based on current foreign currency exchange rates. And our guidance excludes future tax benefits from stock-based compensation.\nTo summarize the key takeaways for the fourth quarter, strong top line growth in proprietary, gross profit margin improvement, growth in operating profit margin, growth in adjusted diluted EPS and growth in operating cash flow, delivering in line with our pillars of execute, innovate and grow.\nI'd now like to turn the call back over to Eric.\n\nEric M. Green\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, West Pharmaceutical Services, Inc.\n\nThank you, Bernard. To summarize on Slide 16, the excellent financial performance reported today continues to reaffirm that our strategy is working. We have a strong base business proven by our market-led approach is delivering unique value to our customers. Our global operations team is efficiently manufacturing and delivering products in this complex environment with a focus on service and quality. And we're continuing to accelerate capital spending across our operations to meet current and anticipated future growth.\nWe realize that our products are critical for health care across the globe, which is why we're so dedicated to support patient health today and well into the future.\nTowanda, we're ready to take questions. Thank you."

Our way of introduction, this is John Sweeney, the new Head of Investor Relations at West. I'm delighted to be here, and I look forward to working with all of you.\nWe issued our financial results earlier this morning, and the release has been posted in the Investors section on the company's website located at westpharma.com. On the call today, we'll review our financial results provide an update on our business and present an updated financial outlook for the full year 2024. There is a slide presentation that accompanies today's call, and a copy of the presentation is available on the Investors section of our website.\nOn Slide 4 is our safe harbor statement.

Reconciliations and limitations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable financial results prepared and conformity to GAAP are provided in this morning's earnings release.\nI'll now turn the call over to our CEO, Eric Green.\n\nEric M. Green\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, West Pharmaceutical Services, Inc.\n\nThank you, John, and welcome to West. And I would like to thank Quintin Live for his partnership over the past 8 years and for his many contributions at West. [indiscernible] We will start on Slide 5, where I will cover 3 main topics: first, examine the drivers of Q2 performance; second, discuss a revised outlook for the remainder of 2024 and third, provide insight on our long-term financial outlook and why we remain confident in our growth strategy.\nLet's begin with Q2 performance. We had a lower-than-expected second quarter impacted by continued customer destocking. That being said, we are seeing promising signs from our customers that give us confidence of a turning point in this trend. Looking ahead, we expect the second half of the year to be stronger than the first half with a return to year-over-year organic growth in the fourth quarter, led by our Proprietary Products segment specifically Biologics.\nWe have adjusted our full year 2024 guidance to reflect a more gradual recovery as compared to our previous expectations. While I'm disappointed that we are lowering our guidance, I want to reiterate my confidence in what's proven market-led strategy and attractive long-term growth potential.\nTurning to Slide 6. We are the market leader in containment and delivery of injectable medicines, which is 1 of the fastest-growing areas of health care. We have an even stronger position in Biologics, which is the fastest-growing segment with injectables. Our products are addressing the most critical therapeutic areas, including immunology, oncology, rare diseases and obesity. And for the past 5 years, West has achieved a CAGR of double-digit organic revenue growth, demonstrating that we have been able to deliver our long-term financial construct of 7% to 9%.\nMoving to Slide 7. Our confidence in our medium- to long-term trajectory is underscored by our ongoing capital expansion projects. The investments we have made to address COVID are now being repurposed to drive increased capacity to address new opportunities. In addition, we have expansion plans focused on HVP products that provide a combination of increased manufacturing capacity and higher level of global standardization through our network.\nIn Biologics, GLP-1s and changing global regulatory requirements, we are seeing increased customer interest for higher quality, lower particulate and more standardized solutions. This favorably positions West Innovations and leading products such as Westar Select and NovaPure. Another focus for our capital allocation is our HBP devices, which includes our self-injection devices. Our platforms are an integral part of our customers' drug device combination products that are making a difference to patients. These expansion projects remain on target for the back half of the year and 2025.\nAnd lastly, before contract manufacturing we have an exciting growth contribution from our new capacity at our Grand Rapids site. A few weeks ago, I had the opportunity to join our team as we open this new portion of the state-of-the-art facility in support of our customers' injection device platform and producing product in Q4. We and we have the ongoing expansion in Dublin, which is already dedicated to contracted demand for components associated with drugs for diabetes and obesity. We expect it to be completed by the end of Q3.\nOur promising growth drivers have us positioned to drive significant value for our customers, the patients and shareholders as we move forward.\nShifting to Slide 8. At the end of June, we published our 2023 sustainability report on the company website. Proudly, we received several accolades, including being named as one of the America's most responsible companies by Newsweek.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Bernard. Bernard?\n\nBernard J. Birkett\n\nSenior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, West Pharmaceutical Services, Inc.\n\nThank you, Eric, and good morning. Let's review the numbers in more detail. We'll first look at Q2 2024 revenues and profits, where we saw a mid-single-digit decline in organic sales as well as declines in operating profit and diluted EPS compared to the second quarter of 2023 given the current market dynamics. I will take you through the drivers impacting sales and margin in the quarter as well as some balance sheet takeaways. And finally, we will provide an update to our 2024 guidance.\nFirst up, Q2. Our financial results are summarized on Slide 9 and the reconciliation of non-U.S. GAAP measures are described in Slides 17 to 22. We recorded net sales of $702.1 million representing an organic sales decline of 5.9%. Looking at Slide 10. Proprietary Products organic net sales decreased 8.4% in the quarter as customers destocking continued at a higher rate than anticipated. High-value products, which made up approximately 71% of proprietary product sales in the quarter declined by double digits, primarily due to decreased sales of our Westar, Daikyo Crystal Zenith and FluroTec products. Looking at the performance of the market units, the Biologics market experienced a mid-single-digit decline, primarily driven by lower volumes of Daikyo Crystal Zenith and Westar products. The pharma market unit saw a low single-digit decline, primarily due to a reduction in sales of admin systems and Westar products. While the generics market unit declined double digits, primarily due to lower volumes of our FluroTec and Westar products.\nDespite these revenue declines in the quarter, we do expect revenues in the second half of 2024 to be greater than the first half. Our Contract Manufacturing segment experienced mid-single-digit net sales growth in the second quarter, led by growth in sales of components associated with injection-related devices. Our adjusted operating profit margin of 18% was a 650 basis point decrease from the same period last year. Finally, adjusted diluted EPS declined 28% for Q2. Excluding stock-based compensation tax benefit, EPS decreased by 28.4%.\nNow let's review the drivers in both our revenue and profit performance. On Slide 11, we show the contributions to organic sales decline in the quarter. Sales price increases contributed $21 million or 2.8 percentage points of growth in the quarter. More than offsetting price was a negative volume and impact mix of $65.5 million primarily due to lower sales volume caused by customer inventory management decisions in the period and a foreign currency headwind of approximately $6.1 million.\nLooking at margin performance. Slide 12 shows our consolidated gross profit margin of 32.8% for Q2 2024, down from 38.7% in Q2 2023. Proprietary Products second quarter gross profit margin of 37% was 690 basis points lower than the margin achieved in the second quarter of 2023. The key drivers for the decline in the Proprietary Products gross profit margin were lower production volume due to the reduced customer demand in the period and an unfavorable mix of products sold partially offset by increased sales prices.\nContract Manufacturing second quarter gross profit margin of 16.2% was 80 basis points greater than the margin achieved in the second quarter of 2023 primarily due to increased sales prices. Now let's look at our balance sheet and review how we've done in terms of generating cash for the business. On Slide 13, [indiscernible] metrics. Operating cash flow was $283.2 million for the 6 months ended June 2024, a decrease of $24.1 million compared to the same period last year or 7.8% decrease, primarily due to a decline in operating results offset by favorable working capital management. Our second quarter 2024 year-to-date capital spending was $190.8 million, $33.3 million higher than the same period last year. We continue to leverage our CapEx to increase both our high-value product and/or contract manufacturing capacity. Working capital of approximately $849.3 million at June 30, 2024 decreased by $415.3 million from December 31, 2023, primarily due to a reduction in our cash balance.\nOur cash balance at June 30, 2024 of $446.2 million was $407.7 million lower than our December 2023 balance. The decrease in cash is primarily due to $454.1 million of share repurchases and our capital expenditures offset by cash from operations.\nTurning to guidance. Slide 14 provides a high-level summary. We are updating our full year 2024 net sales guidance to a range of $2.87 billion to $2.9 billion from a prior range of $3 billion to $3.25 billion. There is an estimated full year 2024 headwind of approximately $5 million based on current foreign exchange rates. We expect organic sales to decline approximately 1% to 2% and compared to our prior guidance of 2% to 3% growth. We are updating our full year 2024 adjusted diluted EPS guidance to be in a range of $6.35 to $6.65 compared to a prior range of $7.63 to $7.88. Also, our CapEx guidance is expected to be $375 million for the year, which is an increase from the previous guidance of $350 million. The increase in CapEx is driven by additional investments in growth initiatives and the timing of spend on 1 of our major projects.\nThere are some key elements I want to bring your attention to as you review our guidance. Full year 2024 adjusted diluted EPS guidance range includes an estimated FX headwind of approximately $0.03 and based on current foreign currency exchange rates, which is a decrease from the prior guidance of $0.04. The updated guidance also includes EPS of $0.22 satiated with first half 2024 tax benefits from stock-based compensation. Our guidance excludes future tax benefits from stock-based compensation.\nI would now like to turn the call back over to Eric.\n\nEric M. Green\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, West Pharmaceutical Services, Inc.\n\nThank you, Bernard. To summarize on Slide 15, we are the market leader in injectables with an even stronger position in biologics. We are seeing promising signs from our customers that destocking is at a turning point. We are investing significant capital in higher growth areas with expanded margins and cash flow, and I'm confident that we'll achieve our long-term financial construct with our proven market-led strategy and future growth drivers with great pride we will continue to live by our purpose and make a positive impact on patient lives.\nShannon, we're ready to take questions. Thank you."

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised today's conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Quintin Lai, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nQuintin J. Lai\n\nAnalyst, Robert W. Baird & Co. Equity Capital Markets\n\nThank you, Valerie. Good morning, and welcome to West's Second Quarter 2023 Conference Call. We issued our financial results this morning and the release has been posted in the Investors section on the company's website located at westpharma.com.\nThis morning, Eric Green and Bernard Birkett will review our financial results, provide an update on our business and present an update on our financial outlook for the full year 2023. There's a slide presentation that accompanies today's call, and a copy of that presentation is available on the Investors section of our website.\nOn Slide 4 is our safe harbor statement. Statements made by management on this call and in the accompanying presentation contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of U.S. federal securities laws. These statements are based on our beliefs and assumptions, current expectations, estimates and forecasts. The company's future results are influenced by many factors beyond the control of the company. Actual results could differ materially from past results as well as those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statement made here. Please refer to today's press release as well as any other disclosures made by the company regarding the risks to which it is subject, including our 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports.\nDuring today's call, management will make reference to non-GAAP financial measures, including organic sales growth, adjusted operating profit, adjusted operating profit margin and adjusted diluted EPS. Reconciliations and limitations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable financial results prepared in conformity to GAAP are provided in this morning's earnings release. I'll now turn the call over to our CEO, Eric Green.\n\nEric M. Green\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, West Pharmaceutical Services, Inc.\n\nThank you, Quintin, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. We will start on Slide 5. I'm pleased to report that we delivered a solid second quarter, which has us positioned for an even stronger performance in the second half of the year. The continued success is a result of our proven growth strategy as we capitalize on the robust customer demand and ongoing capacity expansion projects. And proudly, the strength of the One West team, and unwavering commitment to our purpose continues to set us apart as the trusted market leader. I want to acknowledge the team members across the globe and say thank you.\nThe second quarter performance was driven by our base proprietary products business, which grew mid-teens. As expected, COVID-19 sales continued to drop as the second quarter last year was the peak of our pandemic-related sales. With respect to our base business, the biologics market unit again grew double digits with stable demand. Our generics market unit continued to benefit from HVP capacity expansions as the base grew strong double digits. And the pharma market unit base grew high single digits.\nIn addition, contract manufacturing experienced significant momentum in the quarter with delivery of components for injection-related devices.\nTurning to Slide 6. The key levers of growth in Q2 were primarily driven by HVP components and delivery systems. Our participation rate in recently approved new molecular entities in the U.S. and Europe remains strong. The components developed by West or our partner, Daikyo, are addressing some of the most critical therapeutic areas around immunology, oncology, including gene therapy applications, cardiovascular, neurology, diabetes and obesity. This is also reflected in the solid order book across our biologics, generics and pharma customers, a clear reflection of the needs of the market, and we continue to make good progress on bringing down lead times for certain HVPs. We're seeing our order book patterns reverting to a more normal pre-pandemic cadence.\nIn addition, we continue to work closely with customers to update demand trends for the near and long term. These trends underscore the importance of our capacity investments, which are making a significant impact across West global operations. For example, at our West Kinston plant, we have installed, validated and brought online additional HVP capacity for NovaPure plungers. Although it is early days, we are pleased with the initial output as operations ramp up.\nRecently, I had the opportunity to visit West site in Singapore, where we have enhanced the capabilities to meet growing HVP demand from our commercial customers in the APAC region. It was exciting to see the facility fully equipped with industry-leading coding, pharmaceutical washing, sterilization and automated vision inspection capabilities for elastomers. This marks another exciting milestone on our journey towards meeting the industry's increasing emphasis on biologics.\nShifting to Slide 7. At the end of June, we published our 2022 ESG report on the company website. I am proud of the progress the organization has made towards the new 5-year targets with even greater scientific rigor and quantitative focus on environmentally based targets. We know to fulfill our purpose effectively together as One West, we must continue to progress the sustainability goals, diversity and inclusion and success around our charitable endeavors. These collective efforts from last year were recognized by several organizations, including being named as one of America's climate leaders by USA TODAY.\nMoving to Slide 8. Our full year 2023 organic sales growth outlook remains unchanged at approximately 3% to 4% and we're raising the 2023 financial outlook for overall net sales and adjusted diluted EPS. Now I'll turn the call over to Bernard, who will go into more detail from the quarter. Bernard?\n\nBernard J. Birkett\n\nSenior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, West Pharmaceutical Services, Inc.\n\nThank you, Eric, and good morning. So let's review the numbers in more detail. We'll first look at Q2 2023 revenues and profits, where we saw a low single-digit decrease in organic net sales and a decline in operating profit and diluted EPS compared to the second quarter of 2022.\nI will take you through the drivers impacting sales and margin in the quarter as well as some balance sheet takeaways. And finally, we will provide an update to our 2023 guidance.\nFirst up, Q2. Our financial results are summarized on Slide 9 and the reconciliation of non-U.S. GAAP measures are described in Slides 17 to 21. We recorded net sales of $753.8 million, representing an organic sales decline of 2.5%. COVID-related net revenues are estimated to have been $20 million in the quarter, an approximate $106 million reduction compared to the prior year.\nLooking at Slide 10. Proprietary products organic net sales declined 5.5% in the quarter. High-value products, which made up approximately 74% of proprietary product sales in the quarter, declined due to the reduction in COVID-related net revenues. Looking at the performance of the market units, the generics market unit delivered high single-digit growth led by sales of Westar components and self-injection related devices. While the pharma market unit experienced mid-single-digit growth led by Envision and Westar components as well as admin systems.\nAnd the biologics market unit saw a double-digit decline due to a reduction in sales related to COVID-19 vaccines. Our contract manufacturing segment experienced a double-digit net sales growth primarily driven by an increase in sales of components related to injection-related devices. Our adjusted operating profit margin of 24.5% was a 490 basis point decrease from the same period last year. Finally, adjusted diluted EPS declined 14.6% for Q2. Excluding stock-based compensation tax benefits, EPS decreased by approximately 18%.\nNow let's review the drivers in both our revenue and profit performance. On Slide 11, we show the contributions to organic sales decline in the quarter. Sales price increases contributed $43.1 million or 5.6 percentage points of growth in the quarter, as did a foreign currency tailwind of approximately $4.4 million. Offsetting price was a negative mix impact of $61.9 million, which includes an approximate $106 million reduction in COVID-19 related net demand.\nLooking at margin performance. Slide 12 shows our consolidated gross profit margin of 38.7% for Q2 2023, down from 41.7% in Q2 2022. Proprietary products second quarter gross profit margin of 43.9% was a 230 basis points lower than the margin achieved in the second quarter of 2022. The key driver for the decline in proprietary products gross profit margin was primarily on favorable mix from a reduction in sales related to COVID-19 vaccine, offset by sales price increases, and production efficiencies.\nContract manufacturing second quarter gross profit margin of 15.4% was 90 basis points below the margin achieved in the second quarter of 2022 primarily due to inflationary pressures on our plant labor costs.\nNow let's look at our balance sheet and review how we've done in terms of generating cash. On Slide 13, we have listed some key cash flow metrics. Operating cash flow was $307.3 million for the 6 months ended June 2023, a decrease of $17 million compared to the same period last year, a 5.2% decrease primarily due to a decline in operating results. Our second quarter 2023 year-to-date capital spending was $157.5 million, $25.6 million higher than the same period last year. We continue to leverage our CapEx to increase our high-value product manufacturing capacity.\nWorking capital of approximately $1.36 billion at June 30, 2023, declined by $37.9 million from December 31, 2022, primarily due to reductions in our cash balance. Our cash balance at June 30 of $796.3 million was $98 million lower than our December 2022 balance. The decrease in cash is primarily due to our share repurchase program and higher CapEx, offset by our operating cash flow in the period.\nTurning to Slide 8 provides a high-level summary -- sorry, turning to guidance. Slide 8 provides a high-level summary. We are updating our full year 2023 net sales guidance and expect net sales to be in a range of $2.97 billion to $2.995 billion, compared to our prior guidance range of $2.965 billion and $2.990 billion. There is an estimated full year 2023 tailwind, $20 million based on current foreign exchange rates, compared to prior guidance of a tailwind of $15 million. We expect organic sales growth to be approximately 3% to 4%, unchanged from prior guidance.\nWe are raising our full year 2023 adjusted diluted EPS guidance to be in a range of $7.65 to $7.80 compared to a prior range of $7.50 to $7.65. Also, our CapEx guidance of $350 million for the year, unchanged from prior guidance. There are some key elements I want to bring your attention to as you review our guidance. We expect full year COVID-19 related sales to be approximately $60 million, unchanged from prior guidance. Net sales guidance also includes a reduction of $8 million, resulting from a divestiture of the European facility that produced standard proprietary product components, again, unchanged from prior guidance.\nFull year 2023 adjusted diluted EPS guidance range includes an estimated FX tailwind of approximately $0.05 based on current foreign currency exchange rates compared to prior guidance of a tailwind of $0.02. The updated guidance also includes EPS of $0.26 associated with year-to-date 2023 tax benefits from stock-based compensation. Our guidance excludes future tax benefits from stock-based compensation. I would now like to turn the call back over to Eric.\n\nEric M. Green\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, West Pharmaceutical Services, Inc.\n\nThank you, Bernard. To summarize on Slide 14. The solid financial performance in Q2 has us positioned well for the second half of the year. We continue to have a strong base business, which is a testament to the foundation we have built over time. As a global leader, we recognize the critical role our products play in health care across the globe, and that is why we're so dedicated to supporting patient health, both now and into the future. Valerie, we're ready to take questions. Thank you."

Welcome to West Pharmaceutical Services Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Quintin Lai, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nQuintin J. Lai\n\nVP of Strategy & IR, West Pharmaceutical Services, Inc.\n\nThank you, Shannon.\nGood morning, and welcome to West's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Conference Call.\nWe issued our financial results this morning and the release has been posted in the Investors section on the company's website located at westpharma.com.

Green\n\nChair, President & CEO, West Pharmaceutical Services, Inc.\n\nThank you, Quintin, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today.\nWe will start on Slide 5.\nFor over 100 years, the West name has come to mean so much to so many people. We have grown and expanded from manufacturing primary containment components to designing and manufacturing delivery systems. This remains the same today. As a global market leader who continues to define the evolution of our industry, our 10,000-plus team members are motivated by improving patient lives. The past few years have been a reminder that the world doesn't stand still and the needs of the health care industry are evolving and growing in complexity with shifting treatment options from the hospital to home setting. We remain committed to the pursuit of scientific innovation and partnerships to address the changing needs of today and into the future.\nMoving to Slide 6. Looking back at the year, I'm pleased to report that West delivered overall organic sales growth of approximately 8%. This growth was generated despite a rapidly shifting pandemic landscape. We started 2022 expecting COVID-19 volume growth, but instead decline in orders and demand from our customers actually resulted in a 15% decline in pandemic-related sales. Excluding COVID-19, we estimate that our base organic sales growth was low double digit, with mid-teens growth in proprietary products, and driving this base growth is demand for our high-value product offerings for both legacy as well as recently launched drugs, and we ended the year with a return to growth in Q4 in contract manufacturing. This performance is a result of the dedication and relentless focus of our team members across the globe. We are connected by a strong responsibility and shared values that continue to help us succeed each day. I want to acknowledge these efforts and say thank you.\nLooking ahead, we remain well positioned with the right growth strategy around execute, innovate and grow. Our solid order book of committed orders reinforces the criticality of West's components and devices to address our customers' growing injectable drug demand, and we continue to deploy capital investments to support the increase in demand driven by the attractive end markets.\nTurning to Slide 7. In addition to our financial momentum, there were several other notable accomplishments in 2022. We shipped close to 47 billion components touching billions of patient lives. As scientific and technical leaders in the industry, our customers expect us to help solve their problems. We continue to broaden insights with our expertise through our webinars, published articles and technical presentations. We partnered with Corning to build a next-generation leading elastomer-glass system. We launched Daikyo CZ 2.25 ml insert needle syringe to support the biologics market and secured 3 additional FDA-approved drugs using our SmartDose technology as we continue to bring additional value to our customers.\nLastly, we donated $2.75 million, but more importantly, our team members continue to volunteer their time to help our local communities with the greatest needs. Our heartfelt thoughts are with all those impacted by the devastating earthquake in Turkey and Syria, where we have provided aid through UNICEF.\nShifting to Slide 8. We continue to factor environmental considerations into every aspect of our business. Over the past 5 years, we have made tremendous strides across the 6 priority areas and newly defined performance indicators. I'm pleased that we're on target with 90% of our operational waste not being sent to landfills. Our pursuit of renewable energy alternatives has aided in a positive impact in the emission reduction. These efforts have been recognized with numerous ESG accolades in 2022. We look forward to sharing more detail in our corporate responsibility report to be published in the spring.\nTurning to Slide 9. We continue to address the growing market needs with today's complex and sensitive molecules. At the recent Pharma Pack meeting, we introduced several new products for large volume delivery and complete vial containment solutions. One available product is our West Ready Pack with Corning's Valor ready-to-use vials. This will be the first of many products from our Corning partnership. The combination of these products eliminates the risk of delamination and reduces glass particulate in bulk filling lines. It is drug delivery innovations like this that ensures best-in-class performance with a value proposition to meet the increased regulatory expectations with a complete vial containment solution.\nMoving to Slide 10. We are introducing full year 2023 financial guidance. This guidance is based on demand trends as well as our current capacity levels. It's also reinforced by our strong West and Daikyo participation rate in drug approvals, especially in biologics and biosimilars. We expect full year overall organic sales growth of approximately 3% to 4%, which includes a $303 million year-over-year decline in pandemic-related sales. Excluding this impact, we expect mid-teens overall base organic sales growth with proprietary products growth in the high teens and high single-digit growth in contract manufacturing.\n2023 will represent a transition year for our margin profile as we see a headwind from COVID-19 HVPs. That said, our expected margins for this year are significantly above pre-pandemic 2019 levels. This underscores the strength of our financial construct with annual margin expansion of 100 basis points or more per year. In 2019, we posted operating margin of 16.1%. In 2023, we expect operating margin of 23% to 24%, which would represent an increase of approximately 800 basis points over a 4-year period.\nAlso, today we announced that the Board of Directors has authorized a new share repurchase plan as our prior plan was completed last year. This program is authorized for up to $1 billion of share repurchase. We note that this new program does not have a specified end date. As comparison, in 2022, our 12-month program was completed at $203 million of buybacks. And in 2021, our 12-month program was completed at $137 million of buybacks. This new $1 billion program will provide for a continuation of our share count-neutral strategy, which is assumed in our 2023 full year financial guidance. We believe this program will also provide flexibility for incremental share repurchases depending on various factors such as economic and market conditions.\nTurning to Slide 11. As you can see from our guidance, we seek continued base momentum in 2023, and we're planning for a further additional growth as our customers are preparing for expanded success of their current biologics portfolio and drug launches. As such, we continue to drive forward to complete the installation of our capital expansion plans for additional HVP capacity. The picture shows the progression of our ongoing efforts. On my recent visit to Kinston, it was impressive to see the additional space added to accommodate the installation of new manufacturing equipment to address the growth of HVPs and plungers. Together with other site expansions, this will support future demand across our global manufacturing network.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Bernard.\n\nBernard J. Birkett\n\nSenior VP and Chief Financial & Operations Officer, West Pharmaceutical Services, Inc.\n\nThank you, Eric, and good morning.\nWe will first look at Q4 2022 revenues and profits, where we saw low single-digit organic sales growth and a decline in operating profit and diluted EPS. I will take you through the drivers impacting sales and margin in the quarter as well as some balance sheet takeaways. And finally, we will review our 2023 guidance.\nFirst off, Q4. Our financial results are summarized on Slide 12 and the reconciliation of non-U.S. GAAP measures are described in Slides 20 to 23. We recorded net sales of $708.7 million in the quarter, representing organic sales growth of 2.6%. COVID-related net revenues are estimated to have been approximately $55 million in the quarter, an approximate $69 million reduction compared to the prior year. These net revenues include our assessment of components associated with vaccines, treatment and diagnosis of COVID-19 patients, offset by lower sales to customers affected by lower volumes due to the pandemic.\nLooking at Slide 13. Proprietary Products sales grew organically by 1.8% in the quarter. High-value products, which made up approximately 72% of Proprietary Product sales in the quarter were flat compared to the prior year due to the reduction in COVID-related net revenues.\nLooking at the performance of the market units, the generics market unit delivered double-digit growth led by ambition components and admin systems, while the pharma market unit experienced high single-digit growth led by NovaPure and Westar components. And the biologics market unit saw a mid-single-digit decline due to a reduction in sales related to COVID-19 vaccine.\nOur Contract Manufacturing segment experienced net sales growth of 7% in the fourth quarter, primarily driven by sales of health care-related medical devices. Our adjusted operating profit margin of 22.4% was a 350 basis point decrease from the same period last year. Finally, adjusted diluted EPS declined 13.2% for Q4. Excluding stock-based compensation tax benefit of $0.06 in Q4, EPS declined by approximately 13.6%.\nNow let's review the drivers in both our revenue and profit performance.\nOn Slide 14, we show the contributions to sales growth in the quarter. Sales price increases contributed $28.1 million or 3.8 percentage points of growth. Offsetting price was a foreign currency headwind of approximately $41.3 million and a negative mix impact of $8.9 million, primarily due to a reduction in COVID-19-related net demand.\nLooking at margin performance, Slide 15 shows our consolidated gross profit margin of 37% for Q4 2022, down from 41.1% in Q4 2021. Proprietary Products fourth quarter gross profit margin of 41.6% was 470 basis points lower than the margin achieved in the fourth quarter of 2021. The key drivers for the decline in Proprietary Products gross profit margin were unfavorable mix from a reduction in sales related to COVID-19 vaccine and continued inflationary pressures on our plant costs, including raw materials, labor and overheads. The headwinds were partially offset by sales price increases. Contract Manufacturing fourth quarter gross profit margin of 15.4% was 110 basis points below the margin achieved in the fourth quarter of 2021. The decrease in margin is largely attributed to mix of products sold.\nNow let's look at our balance sheet and review how we've done in terms of generating more cash.\nOn Slide 16, we have listed some key cash flow metrics. Operating cash flow was $724 million for the year, an increase of $140 million compared to the same period last year, a 24% increase. Operating cash flow in the period benefited from our working capital improvement. In 2022, we spent over $284 million on capital expenditures, a 12% increase over 2021. We continue to leverage our CapEx to increase our high-value product manufacturing capacity within our existing facilities in the U.S., Germany, Ireland and Singapore. Working capital of approximately $1.4 billion increased by $252.6 million from 2021, primarily due to higher accounts receivable from our increased sales, higher inventory levels and an increase in our cash position. Our cash balance at December 31 of $894.3 million was $131.7 million higher than our December 2021 balance. The increase in cash is primarily due to our operating results in the period, offset by our share repurchase program and higher CapEx.\nTurning to guidance. Slide 10 provides a high-level summary. Full year 2023 net sales guidance will be in a range of $2.935 billion and $2.96 billion. There is an estimated headwind of $30 million based on current foreign exchange rates. We expect organic sales growth to be approximately 3% to 4%. We expect our full year 2023 adjusted diluted EPS guidance to be in a range of $7.25 to $7.40. Also, our CapEx guidance is $350 million for the year.\nThere are some key elements I want to bring your attention to as you review our guidance. Estimated FX headwind on EPS has an impact of approximately $0.11 based on current foreign currency exchange rates. We expect full year COVID-19 related net sales to be approximately $85 million compared to $388 million in 2022. And our guidance excludes future tax benefits from stock-based compensation.\nI'd now like to turn the call back over to Eric.\n\nEric M. Green\n\nChair, President & CEO, West Pharmaceutical Services, Inc.\n\nGreat. Thank you, Bernard.\nTo summarize on Slide 17, the solid financial performance shared today continues to reaffirm that our growth strategy is working. We have a durable base business proven by our market-led approach which is delivering unique value to our customers. Our global operations team is efficiently manufacturing and delivering products in this complex environment with a focus on service and quality. And we're continuing to progress capital spending across our operations to meet current and anticipated future growth. We realize that our products in pursuit of scientific innovations are critical to health care across the globe which is why we're so committed to support patient health today and well into the future.\nShannon, we're ready to take questions. Thank you."

There's a slide presentation that accompanies today's call, and a copy of the presentation is available on the Investors section of our website.\nOn Slide 4 is our safe harbor statement. Statements made by management on this call and in the accompanying presentation contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of U.S. federal securities law. These statements are based on our beliefs and assumptions current expectations, estimates and forecasts. The company's future results are influenced by many factors beyond the control of the company. Actual results could differ materially from past results as well as those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statement made here. Please refer to today's press release as well as any other disclosures made by the company regarding the risks to which it is subject including our 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports.\nDuring today's call, management will make reference to non-GAAP financial measures, including organic sales growth, adjusted operating profit, adjusted operating profit margin and adjusted diluted EPS. Reconciliations and limitations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable financial results prepared in conformity to GAAP are provided in this morning's earnings release.\nI now turn the call over to our CEO, Eric Green.\n\nEric M. Green\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, West Pharmaceutical Services, Inc.\n\nThank you, Quintin, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today.\nWe'll start on Slide 5. Last year, we celebrated West's 100th anniversary of groundbreaking health care innovation, which is one of many proud highlights shown on this recap slide. I also want to thank our team members who are connected by our strong responsibility and shared values that continue to help us succeed each day.\nNow turning to Slide 6, where I'll cover 3 main topics: first, we will examine the drivers of 2023. Second, we will discuss the challenges ahead in 2024. And third, we will talk about the drivers of growth that we'll return West to long-term financial construct of sales and margin expansion in 2025.\nLet's begin with our financial results. I am pleased with the strong base growth in 2023, which more than offset a decline of COVID-19-related sales of approximately $320 million. Excluding pandemic-related sales, we had strong base overall organic sales growth in the mid-teens. Driving this base growth is the expanding customer demand for our high-value product offerings, both components and devices and for our contract manufacturing services. During the year, we made great strides with our capital expansion plans across our global network. For example, in Kinston, we expanded our footprint with new NovaPure capacity, and we're in the process of a significant expansion in our HVP processing capacity. At our Grand Rapids contract manufacturing site we brought online new capacity for a customer's injection device in late 2022, which contributed to growth in 2023. We also have been able to successfully address our backlog of long lead times for certain products. This has been a challenge since the start of the pandemic, and thanks to the hard work of our teams through both optimization and capacity expansion, we have exited the year with normalized lead times.\nMoving to Slide 7. As we turn our attention to 2024, we are facing several challenges to our growth model as indicated in our preliminary outlook from October. With greater visibility of the changing market landscape, we expect 2% to 3% organic sales growth for the full year or about 5 to 6 percentage points lower than our preliminary outlook. This difference comes from 4 main factors. First, we had expected flat COVID-related sales this year. Instead, demand continues to decline, which resulted in about 1% point decrease in organic sales. Second, timing of HVP device manufacturing capacity coming online, to satisfy customer demand has been pushed out, causing a percentage point of headwind. Third, timing of a customer's upgrade to a higher HVP tier has caused a percentage point of headwind. And finally; fourth, a more widespread destocking is causing approximately 2 to 3 percentage points of headwind. Towards the end of the year and into January, the industry, inventory management trend and other life science tools companies have been experiencing has now reached our segment of the injectable drug value chain. While we thought we might see some impact in 2024, we were surprised with the breadth, latitude and speed at which customers change their forecast. In several of these cases, customers express to us the same sentiment at the amount of forecast changes that were being handed to them.\nAs we look to overall quarterly pacing for 2024, we expect that Q1 will have the largest negative impact due to destocking as well as timing of new HVP device capacity and customer-led HVP upgrade. We expect in Q1 that proprietary products will be down by high single decline. We expect some effect, but to a lesser degree in Q2 with positive proprietary products and consolidated organic growth. And we expect the second half of the year to have better growth with Q4 in line with our long-term financial construct. As we set our 2024 guidance and quarterly cadence, we see several areas that support our expectations. First, our February order book for the second half of the year has a higher coverage ratio than prior pre-pandemic levels. Second, we have some customers that are expected to be able to produce more drugs as the year progresses. Third, we expect HVP device capacity to improve in the second half of the year as we implement process modifications that were designed to improve manufacturing throughput. I am disappointed that we're not -- we will not achieve our usual full year organic sales and margin expansion in 2024. As I've outlined, outside of further COVID demand reduction, some of the impact is time related to new capacity and timing of customer upgrades. As for destocking, this is an industry-wide situation, not a change in market share or patient demand for drug volumes. Looking beyond 2024, we continue to be bullish on our growth construct. And our teams will have another active year of capital investments in 2024.\nMoving to Slide 8. We will be expanding our industry-leading capacity with major HVP expansion projects in Jersey Shore and Eschweiler as well as other projects across the global network. Another driver of growth with a bright future comes from our HVP devices, which includes our injection delivery device platforms, Crystal Zenith containment solutions in the admin systems. HVP devices had very strong double-digit organic sales growth in 2023 and now represent 10% of overall sales. Less platforms are an integral part of our customers' drug device combination products that are making a difference to patients. And this year, we have had multiple capital expansion projects that will increase capacity for SmartDose, self-dose and admin systems, with some expected to come online in the second half of 2024 and fully online in 2025. As mentioned at the outset, contract manufacturing had growth contribution from new capacity at our Grand Rapids site to support our customer's injection device platform.\nLooking ahead, we're excited to have started a significant expansion at our Dublin facility, which is already dedicated to contracted demand for future injection device manufacturing. We expect to be completed and validated in 2024, which places us in a great position for 2025 growth. I also want to take some time to talk about the dynamics of future demand related to our growth drivers for HVP components. As you know, we have been building HVP capacity for several years and expect it to continue to do so in 2024. We see a robust runway of volume growth over the next few years. As a foundation, we expect volume growth of existing drugs with increasing aging patient populations, expanding geographical reach and evolving treatment guidelines and market conditions. In addition to overall volume growth, we continue to experience and see certain drugs have breakthrough growth. For example, we are experiencing a similar surge in demand for components associated with drugs treating diabetes and obesity. Our responsibility as the industry leader in primary packaging is to be prepared for incremental jumps in demand. And lastly, the area with the most potential for our future growth is our HVP capacity to support and mix shift. For mix shift, we see a combination of volume from new drugs that enter the market and from legacy drugs that upgrade from either a standard component or lower to a higher HVP category. The mix shift of legacy to HVP has historically been a smaller contributor for us compared to contribution from newly approved drugs. However, with the industry landscape changing, regulators are introducing new regulations for higher quality lower particulate and more standardized solutions. And therefore, customers are looking to upgrade their standard primary components. When we look at that over the next few years, we estimate that several billions of our primary containment components in standard form could benefit from a mix shift to our modern formulation and HVP processes. We recognize this mix shift will take time, but we anticipate as new regulation changes are enforced. This adoption will accelerate. By considering our combination of growth drivers from volume, price and HVP mix shift, we can confidently assert that we will be well equipped to navigate the challenges and continue to fuel our long-range financial construct of 7% to 9% annual organic sales growth and at least 100 basis points of operating margin expansion per year.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Bernard. Bernard?\n\nBernard J. Birkett\n\nSenior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, West Pharmaceutical Services, Inc.\n\nThank you, Eric, and good morning.\nLet's review the numbers in more detail. We'll first look at Q4 2023 revenues and profits, where we saw low single-digit organic sales growth and an increase in diluted EPS and operating profit. I will take you through the drivers impacting sales and margin in the quarter as well as some balance sheet takeaways. And finally, we will review our 2024 guidance.\nFirst of Q4. Our financial results are summarized on Slide 9 and the reconciliation of non-U.S. GAAP measures are described in Slides 17 to 21. We recorded net sales of $732 million in the quarter, representing organic sales growth of 1.4%. COVID-related net revenues are estimated to have been approximately $7 million in the quarter and approximately $48 million reduction compared to the prior year.\nLooking at Slide 10. Proprietary Products organic net sales declined by 0.3% in the quarter. As we anticipated, in addition to the COVID decline, we continue to experience a destocking of inventory by certain of our customers during the fourth quarter. High-value products, which made up approximately 75% of proprietary product sales in the quarter, generated low single-digit growth, led by customer demand for HVP components and devices.\nLooking at the performance of the market units, the pharma market unit had low single-digit growth led by demand for Daikyo and NovaPure components, partially offset by a reduction in sales related to COVID. The biologics and generics market units experienced low single-digit and mid-single-digit declines, respectively, due to a reduction in sales related to COVID-19 vaccine.\nOur Contract Manufacturing segment showed high single-digit net sales growth, led by an increase in sales of medical device and diagnostic products. We recorded $278.2 million in gross profit, which was $16.1 million or 6.1% higher than Q4 of last year. And our gross profit margin of 38% was a 100 basis point increase from the same period last year. Our adjusted operating profit increased to $159.9 million this quarter compared to $158.7 million in the same period last year. Our adjusted operating profit margin of 21.8% was a 60 basis point decrease from the same period last year. Finally, adjusted diluted EPS rose 3.4% for Q4. Excluding stock-based compensation tax benefit of $0.01 in Q4, EPS increased by approximately 6.4%.\nNow let's review the drivers in both our revenue and profit performance. On Slide 11, we show the contributions to sales growth in the quarter. Sales price increases contributed $39 million or 5.5 percentage points of growth in the quarter as did a foreign currency tailwind of approximately $18.5 million. Offsetting price was a negative mix impact of $29.3 million, primarily due to a reduction in COVID-19-related net demand of $48 million and destocking trends in the sector by certain of our customers.\nLooking at margin performance on Slide 12. Proprietary Products fourth quarter gross profit margin of 42.7% is 110 basis points higher than the margin achieved in the fourth quarter of 2022. The key driver for the increase in proprietary products gross profit margin related to sales price increases, offset by inflationary pressures at our plants and mix from the reduction in COVID revenues. Contract Manufacturing fourth quarter gross profit margin of 17.9% was 250 basis points greater than the margin achieved in the fourth quarter of 2022. The increase in margin can be attributed to sales price increases and a favorable mix of products sold.\nAnd let's look at our balance sheet and review how we've done in terms of generating more cash. On Slide 13, we have listed some key cash flow metrics. Operating cash flow was $776.5 million for the year, an increase of $52.5 million compared to the same period last year, a 7.3% increase. Operating cash flow in the period primarily benefited from favorable working capital management. In 2023, we spent $362 million on capital expenditures, a 27.2% increase over 2022. We continue to leverage our CapEx to increase our high-value product manufacturing capacity and/or contract manufacturing capacity. Working capital of approximately $1.26 billion decreased by $135.9 million from 2022, primarily due to an increase in our current portion of long-term debt and reduction in our cash balance. Our cash balance at December 31st, $853.9 million was $40.4 million, lower than our December 2022 balance. The decrease in cash is primarily due to increased CapEx and share repurchases, offset by our working capital management.\nTurning to guidance. Slide 7 provides a high-level summary. Full year 2024 net sales guidance will be in a range of $3 billion to $3.025 billion. There is an estimated headwind of $8 million based on current foreign exchange rates. We expect organic sales growth to be approximately 2% to 3%. We expect our full year 2024 adjusted diluted EPS guidance to be in a range of $7.50 to $7.75. Also, our CapEx guidance is $350 million for the year.\nThere are some key elements I want to bring your attention to as you review our guidance. Estimated FX headwind on EPS has an impact of approximately $0.02 based on current foreign currency exchange rates and our guidance excludes future tax benefits from stock-based compensation.\nI would now like to turn the call back over to Eric.\n\nEric M. Green\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, West Pharmaceutical Services, Inc.\n\nThank you, Bernard.\nTo summarize on Slide 14, our proven growth strategy continues to deliver unique value, the breadth of our high-quality product offerings. This is evidenced by a robust committed order book. Despite the headwinds and challenges in the sector, our team is committed to overcome these obstacles to meet the anticipated growth expectations. I'm confident and excited about the future for West as we continue to make a difference to patient health across the globe.\nLatif, we're ready to take questions. Thank you."

You may begin.\n\nQuintin J. Lai\n\nVP of Strategy & IR, West Pharmaceutical Services, Inc.\n\nThank you, Towanda. Good morning, and welcome to West's Second Quarter 2022 Conference Call. We issued our financial results this morning, and the release has been posted in the Investors section on the company's website located at westpharma.com.\nThis morning, Eric Green and Bernard Birkett will review our financial results, provide an update on our business and present an update on our financial outlook for the remaining full year of 2022. There is a slide presentation that accompanies today's call and a copy of that presentation is available on the Investors section of our website.\nOn Slide 4 is our safe harbor statement.

Reconciliations and limitations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable financial results prepared in conformity to GAAP are provided in this morning's earnings release.\nI now turn the call over to our CEO, Eric Green.\n\nEric M. Green\n\nChair, President & CEO, West Pharmaceutical Services, Inc.\n\nThank you, Quintin, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. We will start on Slide 5. I'm pleased to report that we delivered an excellent second quarter. We grew 13% organically with over 18% organic sales growth in our Proprietary Products segment. Our base business continues to have solid demand across all 3 market units: Biologics, Pharma and Generics, which more than offsets a slight decline in COVID-19-related sales. And again, our high-value products led the way to this impressive growth.\nOur continued success highlights the strength and resilience of our proven strategy of execute, innovate and grow, which continues to set us apart as a trusted market leader. It is the strength of our One West team guided by our purpose that makes a meaningful difference in ensuring our customers have reliable supply of the components necessary to deliver drugs to patients.\nAn example of our One West culture in action is our team members in China, who I would like to thank for their inspiring efforts and commitment to our customers during the lockdowns in April and May. The relentless focus in our purpose enabled us to reopen our sites and continue to serve our customers with minimal impact.\nNow moving to Slide 6. We made great progress in the second quarter. Let me briefly share a few highlights. We continue to deliver the key drivers of growth in Q2, primarily driven by our HVP components including NovaPure, Envision, Daikyo Crystal Zenith and self-injection devices. With a strong order book for our Biologics and Generics customers, along with Pharma demand ramping up, we are seeing the benefits of our capital spend investments as we optimize productivity across our global operations. Our 2020 capital expansion is now complete and we're driving forward to complete the installation of our 2021 expansion.\nTurning to Crystal Zenith. We have been expanding capacity of our 1-ml syringe as our customer uptake has been robust. At the 2022 BIO International Conference, we launched the Daikyo Crystal Zenith 2.25 ml insert needle syringe system. With a market trend for larger-dose injections, we're able to answer the needs of more patients with a safe and reliable containment solution. The new CZ syringe system will help our customers bring a larger volume of product to patients with fewer or less frequent injections, enabling an easier patient experience.\nAs we continue to advance the standard of care for patients with our customers, I'm pleased to share that we have a combination drug approved using our newly launched CZ 2.25-ml system with targeted customer launch in 2023. In addition, we're seeing good progress with our SmartDose on-body subcu delivery system and now have 3 FDA-approved biologic drugs using our technology.\nShifting to Slide 7 and an update on ESG. At the end of June, we published our 2021 corporate responsibility report on the company website. We are tracking well towards our 5-year targets, and I'm proud of how our organization has connected our One West culture with our ESG initiatives. We know to fulfill our purpose effectively, we must progress our environmental sustainability goals, diversity and inclusion and success around our charitable efforts. Together, this makes for a better performing company today and into the future.\nI'm also pleased to share that yesterday, we announced that our Board of Directors has elected Dr. Stephen Lockhart as our newest member. As the former Chief Medical Officer of Sutter Health in California, his expertise will be a valuable addition to our Board.\nBefore I turn it over to Bernard, I want to provide some high-level thoughts on our updated full year outlook and implied second half 2022 guidance. We have 2 headwinds: FX and slowing COVID-19 demand. On the positive, not only has our base business been strong in the first half of the year, but we also expect the Generics and Pharma market units to perform even better in the second half of the year with additional resources to address the demand dynamics.\nFor guidance, we're taking our overall sales down by $100 million for the full year. Incremental FX is going to be a $75 million headwind. In addition, we're seeing a decline in COVID-19 demand as compared to our April outlook that assumed modest growth over 2021. While we're seeing some orders for stoppers for smaller vials to hold fewer doses, we do not assume a meaningful sales impact in 2022 and expect an overall decline of COVID-19 sales of 20% or $85 million from 2021 sales levels.\nTo sum it up, changes in FX and COVID are causing headwinds well in excess of our $100 million negative change to full year sales guidance. On the positive side, we're expecting even stronger base business growth in the second half of this year from all 3 market units of Biologics, Pharma and Generics that is helping to moderate the guidance impact.\nNow I'll turn it over call to Bernard.\n\nBernard J. Birkett\n\nSenior VP and Chief Financial & Operations Officer, West Pharmaceutical Services, Inc.\n\nThank you, Eric, and good morning. Let's review the numbers in more detail. We'll first look at Q2 2022 revenues and profits, where we saw another strong quarter of sales growth, led by performance in our Biologics and Generics market units. I will take you through the profit drivers in the quarter as well as some balance sheet takeaways. And finally, we will provide an update to our 2022 guidance.\nFirst up, Q2. Our financial results are summarized on Slide 8, and the reconciliation of non-U.S. GAAP measures are described in Slides 17 to 20. We recorded net sales of $771.3 million, representing organic sales growth of 13.1%.\nLooking at Slide 9. Proprietary Products sales grew organically by 18.3% in the quarter. High-value products, which made up approximately 73% of proprietary product sales in the quarter, grew double digits and had solid momentum across Biologics and Generics market units in Q2.\nLooking at the performance of the market units, the Biologics market unit delivered strong double-digit growth. We continue to work with many biotech and biopharma customers who are using West and Daikyo high-value product offerings.\nThe Generics market unit also experienced strong double-digit growth led by sales of FluroTec and Westar components. Our Pharma market unit saw mid-single-digit growth with sales led by high-value products, including NovaPure components. And Contract Manufacturing declined 8.9% for the second quarter due to a reduction in sales of components for diagnostic devices. We recorded $321.5 million in gross profit, $6.4 million or 2% above Q2 of last year. And our gross profit margin of 41.7% was a 180 basis point decline from the same period last year. We saw improvement in adjusted operating profit with $227 million recorded this quarter compared to $211.2 million in the same period last year for a 7.5% increase. And our adjusted operating profit margin of 29.4% was a 20 basis point increase from the same period last year.\nFinally, adjusted diluted EPS grew $0.01 for Q2. Excluding stock-based compensation tax benefit of $0.01 in Q2, EPS grew by approximately 4%. So let's review the drivers in both revenue and profit. On Slide 10, we show the contributions to sales growth in the quarter. Volume and mix contributed $71.7 million, or 9.9 percentage points of growth and sales price increases contributed $23.4 million or 3.2 percentage points of growth in the quarter.\nLooking at margin performance. Slide 11 shows our consolidated gross profit margin of 41.7% for Q2 2022, down from 43.5% in Q2 2021. Proprietary Products' second quarter gross profit margin of 46.2% was 360 basis points lower than the margin achieved in the second quarter of 2021. The decline in Proprietary Products gross profit margin was caused by inflationary pressures impacting all planned costs, including raw materials, labor and overheads. Partially offsetting these inflationary headwinds was improvement in our product mix, price increases and pass-through surcharges and approximately 90 basis points of benefit associated with onetime fees from COVID supply agreements.\nContract Manufacturing second quarter gross profit margin of 16.3% was 40 basis points below the margin achieved in the second quarter of 2021. The decrease in margin is largely attributed to mix of products sold in the period.\nNow let's look at our balance sheet and review how we've done in terms of generating more cash. On Slide 12, we have listed some key cash flow metrics. Operating cash flow was $324.3 million for the 6 months ended June 2022, an increase of $91.2 million compared to the same period last year, a 39.1% increase. Our operating cash flow in the period benefited from increased earnings, our working capital performance and timing of income tax payments.\nOur second quarter 2022 year-to-date capital spending was $131.9 million, $20.3 million higher than the same period last year. Working capital of approximately $1.2 billion at June 30, 2022, increased by $58.1 million from December 31, 2021, primarily due to increases in accounts receivable and inventory, offset by reductions in our cash.\nOur cash balance at June 30 of $718.5 million was $44.1 million lower than our December 2021 balance. The decrease in cash is primarily due to our share repurchase program and higher CapEx, offset by our strong operating cash flow in the period.\nTurning to guidance. Slide 13 provides a high-level summary. We are updating our full year 2022 net sales guidance and expect net sales to be in a range of $2.95 billion and $2.975 billion compared to our prior guidance range of $3.05 billion to $3.075 billion. There is an estimated headwind of $190 million based on current foreign exchange rates compared to a prior estimated headwind of $115 million.\nWe expect organic sales growth to be approximately 11% compared to prior guidance of approximately 11% to 12%. We expect our full year 2022 adjusted diluted EPS guidance to be in a range of $9 to $9.15 compared to a prior range of $9.30 to $9.45. This revised guidance includes our first half $0.13 EPS positive impact of tax benefits from stock-based compensation.\nAlso, our CapEx guidance remains at $380 million for the year. There are some key elements I want to bring your attention to as you review our guidance. Estimated FX headwind on EPS has an increased impact of approximately $0.55 based on current foreign currency exchange rates, compared to a prior estimated headwind of $0.38. We expect full year COVID-19-related sales to be approximately $85 million lower than 2021 sales. And our guidance excludes future tax benefits from stock-based compensation.\nTo summarize the key takeaways for the quarter, strong top line growth in proprietary, growth in operating profit, solid adjusted diluted EPS despite FX and inflationary headwinds and growth in operating cash flow, delivering in line with our pillars of execute, innovate and grow.\nI would now like to turn the call back over to Eric.\n\nEric M. Green\n\nChair, President & CEO, West Pharmaceutical Services, Inc.\n\nThank you, Bernard. To summarize on Slide 14, our performance in Q2 has positioned us well for the second half of the year. We continue to have a strong base business, which is a testament to the foundation we have built over time with the right strategy and execution, leveraging the benefits of a global operating model to deliver the robust book of committed orders and continue to accelerate capital spending across our operations to meet current and anticipated future growth.\nTowanda, we're ready to take questions. Thank you."

I now turn over the call to our CEO, Eric Green.\n\nEric M. Green\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, West Pharmaceutical Services, Inc.\n\nGreat, thank you, Quentin, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Due to an unexpected family emergency back in Ireland, Bernard cannot participate today. I appreciate your understanding. Quintin will step in for Bernard. We'd like to begin by addressing the ongoing situation in Israel.\nOur top priority and focus remains on the safety and well-being of our team members and their families that live and work in the region. Now let's turn to Slide 5 and the Q3 performance. I am pleased to report that our team delivered a solid third quarter. Our ongoing success can be attributed to our well-established market-led growth strategy, which allows us to take full advantage of our solid base customer demand and recent capacity expansions.\nAnd it is the strength of our One West team, who I'd like to thank that make us -- make a meaningful difference to ensuring our customers have reliable supply of components necessary to deliver drugs to patients. In the third quarter, we had solid organic net sales growth of 5.7%. With an approximate $78 million year-over-year decrease and COVID-19-related sales. Our base organic sales growth exceeded 20% for both the Enterprise and our Proprietary Products segment.\nShifting to Slide 6. In proprietary products, we had strong base demand of HVP components and devices. We continue to see certain customers experiencing strong uptake of their drugs as they accelerate and increase their replenishment orders with us. The greater than 20% growth in our base business was again led by our Biologics market unit, which had very strong double-digit growth in the quarter, excluding the impact of COVID-19-related sales.\nAnd, as we have seen through much of the year, we also had accelerated growth from restocking long lead time HVP components, that we've been able to produce through our capacity expansions. This fueled growth in our generics and pharma market units. During September and October, we have started to see an increase in inventory management trends by certain large pharma and generic customers, especially for our standard products, as they manage their safety stocks for the remainder of the year.\nThese issues have led us to temper our fourth quarter organic sales growth to 2% to 3%. Excluding COVID-related sales, we expect double-digit overall organic sales growth and double-digit proprietary product sales growth for the quarter. And we continue to monitor the situation in Israel and currently do not expect any impact on our ability to manufacture and ship out of the country.\nAs in prior years, we will provide our formal 2024 guidance on our upcoming February Q4 call. In a bit of a preview, despite the inventory management we are seeing by some of our large customers, we continue to expect to deliver our financial construct of 7% to 9% organic sales growth and 100 basis points of operating margin expansion. In addition, we anticipate that our pandemic-related sales are at a point, where we will no longer have to separate our base performance in 2024.\nLastly, a key aspect of our growth strategy and market leadership is West's team of scientific thought leaders and technical experts. They continue to advance the care for patients with our customers, through valuable insights to address the changing needs of more complex molecules and combination products. For example, at the recent PDA conference and CPhI Worldwide conference, several of our West experts delivered insightful presentations about the revised regulatory standards and emphasis on the development of sustainable products. Now I'll turn the call over to Quintin, who will go into more detail from the quarter. Quintin?\n\nQuintin J. Lai\n\nAnalyst, Robert W. Baird & Co. Equity Capital Markets\n\nThank you, Eric, and good morning. Let's review the numbers in more detail. We'll first look at Q3 2023 revenues and profits, where we saw a mid-single-digit increase in organic net sales growth, an increase in diluted EPS and a decline in operating profit compared to the third quarter of 2022.\nI will also take you through the drivers impacting sales and margin in the quarter, as well as some balance sheet takeaways. And finally, we'll provide an update to our 2023 guidance. First of Q3. Our financial results are summarized on Slide 7 and a reconciliation of non-U.S. GAAP measures are described in Slides 16 to 20.\nWe recorded net sales of $747.4 million, representing organic sales growth of 5.7%. COVID-related net revenues are estimated to have been approximately $18 million in the quarter, a decline of $78 million compared to the same period last year.\nLooking at Slide 8. Q3 proprietary products, organic net sales increased 3.2%. High-value products which made up approximately 76% of Proprietary Products segment sales grew by mid-single digits, led by customer demand for HPV components and devices. Taking a look at the performance of the market units, including the negative impact from a reduction of COVID-19-related sales, the generics market unit, delivered high single-digit growth and the pharma market unit experienced low single-digit growth, both led by Westar components and Advent systems.\nThe Biologics market unit also saw low single-digit growth driven by sales of Fluorotech components and self-injection delivery devices. Our Contract Manufacturing segment experienced double-digit net sales, organic sales growth led by an increase in components that sales of components related to injection-related devices and health care diagnostic devices.\nOur adjusted operating profit margin of 24.2% and was a 290 basis point decreased from the same period last year. Finally, adjusted diluted EPS increased 6.4% for Q3, excluding stock-based compensation, tax benefit, adjusted diluted EPS increased by 1% compared to last year.\nNow let's review the drivers in both our revenue and profit performance. On Slide 9, we showed the contribution to organic sales growth in the quarter. Sales price increases contributed $46.2 million or 6.8 percentage points of growth in the quarter. Foreign currency tailwind was approximately $25.1 million or 3.7 percentage points of growth. Overall mix and volume negatively impacted sales by $7.3 million. This includes an approximate $78 million reduction in COVID-19-related net demand, partially offset by positive volume and mix contribution from our non-COVID base business.\nLooking at margin performance. Slide 10 shows our consolidated gross profit margin of 38.6% for Q3, down from 39.0% in the same period last year. Proprietary Products third quarter gross profit margin of 43.4% was 20 basis points lower than margin achieved in the same period last year. The key driver for the decline in Proprietary Products gross profit margin was an unfavorable mix from a reduction in sales related to COVID-19 vaccines, offset by sales price increases that offset inflationary cost pressures in our plans.\nContract Manufacturing, third quarter gross profit margin of 18.6% was 130 basis points higher than the margin achieved in the third quarter of last year, due to a favorable mix of products sold, and increased sale prices offset by inflationary pressures on our plant labor costs.\nNow let's look at our balance sheet and review how we've done in terms of generating cash for the business. On Slide 11, we have listed some key cash flow metrics. Operating cash flow was $537.4 million for the first 9 months of 2023. An increase of $44.2 million compared to the same period last year, a 9% increase primarily due to improvement in working capital. Our third quarter 2023 year-to-date capital spending was $253.3 million, $63.6 million higher than the same period last year. We continue to leverage our CapEx to increase our high-value product manufacturing capacity.\nWorking capital of approximately $1.44 billion at September 30, 2023, increased by $38.3 million from December 31, 2022, primarily due to growth in our current assets, offset by an increase in our current portion of long-term debt. Our cash balance at September 30, 2023, was $898.6 million and was $4.3 million higher than our December 2022 balance. The small increase in cash is primarily driven by positive operating results, offset by increased repurchases under our share repurchase program and higher CapEx.\nTurning to guidance. Slide 12 provides a high-level summary. We're updating our full year 2023 net sales guidance and expect net sales to be in a range of $2.95 billion to $2.96 billion compared to a prior guidance range of $2.97 billion to $2.995 billion. There is an estimated full year 2023 tailwind of $20 million based on current FX rates, unchanged from prior guidance. We expect organic sales to be approximately 2% to 3% for the full year, compared to the prior guidance range of 3% to 4%.\nWe are raising our full year 2023 adjusted diluted EPS guidance to be in a range of $7.95 to $8 compared to a prior range of $7.65 to $7.80. Also, our CapEx guidance is $350 million for the year, unchanged from prior guidance. There are some key elements I want to bring to your attention. We have lowered our revenue guidance to reflect the recent trend with certain pharma and generic customers, slowing their restocking of inventory and increased inventory management as we head into the end of the year. We expect full year COVID-19 related sales to be approximately $68 million, compared to prior guide of $60 million.\nNet sales guidance also includes a reduction of $8 million, resulting from a divestiture of a European facility that produced standard Proprietary Products, and this is unchanged from prior guidance. Full year 2023 adjusted diluted EPS range includes an FX tailwind of approximately $0.07, based on current FX exchange rates, compared to prior guidance of a tailwind of $0.05.\nThe updated guidance also includes EPS of $0.41 associated with year-to-date 2023 tax benefits from stock base comp. Our guidance excludes future tax benefits from stock-based compensation. I would like to highlight that over the last 5 years, our base business growth, excluding COVID-19 has been within or above our construct of annual -- organic revenue growth of 7% to 9%. And over the same time period, we've averaged our annual operating margin expansion of over 100 basis points.\nAs Eric mentioned earlier, we are providing a preliminary look to 2024. Based on current trends in demand, we anticipate that West will again be within our long-range financial construct of organic sales growth and operating profit margin expansion. As usual, we'll provide more detailed guidance on 2024 in our February call. I'd like to turn the call back over to Eric.\n\nEric M. Green\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, West Pharmaceutical Services, Inc.\n\nThank you, Quintin. To summarize on Slide 13. We had a solid Q3 performance and are on track for double-digit base organic sales growth in Q4. Our base business remains strong, which is a testament to the durability of the foundation we have built over time. We are proud to serve as a valuable trusted partner for customers to support patient health and look forward to continue to play a critical role in delivering health care well into the future. Michelle, we're ready to take questions. Thank you."

Welcome to the 2022 West Pharmaceutical Services Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions)\nPlease be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Quintin Lai, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nQuintin J. Lai\n\nVP of Strategy & IR, West Pharmaceutical Services, Inc.\n\nThank you. Good morning, and welcome to West's Third Quarter 2022 Conference Call. We issued our financial results this morning, and the release has been posted in the Investors section on the company's website located at westpharma.com. This morning, Eric Green and Bernard Birkett will review our financial results, provide an update on our business, provide an update on our financial outlook for the full year of 2022 and an introduction to a preliminary 2023 outlook. There is a slide presentation that accompanies today's call, and a copy of that presentation is available on the Investors section of our website.\nOn Slide 4 is our safe harbor statement. Statements made by management on this call and in the accompanying presentation contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of U.S. federal securities law. These statements are based on our beliefs and assumptions, current expectations as forecast. The company's future results are influenced by many factors beyond the control of the company. Actual results could differ materially from past results as well as those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statement made here. Please refer to today's press release as well as any other disclosures made by the company regarding the risks to which it is subject, including our 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports.\nDuring today's call, management will make reference to non-GAAP financial measures, including organic net sales, adjusted operating profit, adjusted operating profit margin and adjusted diluted EPS. Reconciliations and limitations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable financial results prepared in conformity to GAAP are provided in this morning's earnings release.\nI'd now turn the call over to our CEO, Eric Green.\n\nEric M. Green\n\nChair, President & CEO, West Pharmaceutical Services, Inc.\n\nThank you, Quintin, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. We'll start on Slide 5. I I'll begin by covering 3 main topics: first, examining the drivers of lower-than-expected Q3 results; second, examining the impact to Q4; and third, providing color on our current view of market demand and projecting a preliminary sales outlook for 2023.\nLet's begin with Q3. As expected, we had a few drivers in the quarter that materialized. We had headwinds from FX. We had declining sales in contract manufacturing, and we had a decline in COVID-19-related sales of about $20 million from last year. If we exclude the headwinds from COVID, proprietary organic sales grew over 11%; however, this performance was below our expectations for the quarter. When we provided guidance on the Q2 earnings call, we projected that we would be able to shift resources, formerly dedicated to pandemic-related production to other HVP products that are experiencing increased demand.\nSpecifically, we plan to successfully address this transition by accelerating customer orders for NovaPure plungers and fulfilling customer HVP orders originally requested for this year but pushed to 2023 because of longer lead times. These 2 factors were the underlying drivers to our guidance of strong double-digit base organic net sales in Q3 and Q4. Instead, as the quarter progressed, we underestimated the complexity of the transition and were impacted with a series of setbacks related to capacity constraints and mix shift productivity.\nMuch of our vaccine stoppers were going to fewer customers with fewer SKUs. This enabled high productivity and throughput with our HVP network. When transitioning to NovaPure plungers, we now are addressing demand coming from numerous customers, addressing drugs across numerous diseases and more SKUs. The end result is lower throughput through our existing HVP manufacturing sites. And compounding this situation further, as the quarter progressed, we had a reduction in capacity in our HVP operating network through a combination of equipment downtime and project delays related to installation of HVP processing equipment.\nWe estimate that the total negative impact to Q3 was $30 million. While we see these issues as temporary and expect full resolution in 2023, they will continue to impact us in Q4. As we look at the capacity constraints, we project that additional HVP processing capacity will come online early next year based on the timeline to install and validate the newer technology. Since we are already running at full capacity, we also are unable to address the additional demand coming from long lead time items in Q4. Altogether, while we still expect our base business ex COVID to grow more than 10% in Q4, we will not be able to offset the expected $80 million reduction in COVID-19 sales.\nWhile I'm disappointed that we're lowering our forecast for the rest of 2022, I want to stress that these issues are all supply-related and not demand related.\nMoving to Slide 6. Our robust order book of committed orders, excluding the declining COVID-19-related demand grew 20% year-over-year. Our customers have reiterated that they're looking to us to deliver the critical components and devices to address the growing injectable drug demand. And we are -- we have several customers that have notified us of potential upside demand, especially for NovaPure plungers beyond our current order book based on future drug launches. As we look at 2023, we are confident and expect most of the capacity issues will be resolved early in the year.\nTaking a reasonable view on capacity expansion and customer delivery timing, our preliminary look at 2023 includes the following projections. First, we now assume that COVID-19 sales will decline to a full year 2023 sales of approximately $90 million or a 75% decline from 2022. This is based on current customer forecasts, which we believe assumes a continuation of current trends and COVID booster demand. We expect non-COVID-19 overall base business to grow in the double digits and in excess of our financial construct of 7% to 9%. Base proprietary products are expected to grow in the low teens led by biologics, and we expect CM sales to rebound to growth next year.\nOur participation rate in recently approved new molecular entities in the U.S. and Europe remain strong. Our components by West or our partner, Daikyo, are expecting almost all the biologics and biosimilars approved so far in 2022 and majority of small molecules approved. Adding it all together, our prelimited view is that we will have positive organic sales growth in 2023, despite an anticipated decline of approximately $280 million of COVID-19 sales. We will provide more detailed guidance on our Q4 call in February of next year.\nNow shifting to Slide 7 and some highlights from the quarter. I want to first thank our team members who continue to focus on our purpose to deliver superior value to customers through our high-quality products and solutions to make a meaningful difference to patients' lives. An example of this dedication and resiliency was evident in the recent response to the hurricanes that devastated Puerto Rico and Florida. Despite the personal impacts to our team members, they ensure their plants continued to produce and ship product with minimal impact. Just another great testimony to the strength of our One West team.\nWe continue to make good strides with the opportunity to improve at-home management of diseases. I'm pleased to share that earlier this month, our customer, scPharmaceuticals, received FDA approval for FUROSCIX delivered via on-body infuser, utilizing West, SmartDose on-body drug delivery technology. This brings us to 4 FDA-approved drugs using our SmartDose technology.\nOur strategic collaboration with Corning is moving along. We anticipate that in Q1 2023, West Ready Pack system with Valor Glass vials, a ready-to-use sterile packaging system for use with NovaPure stoppers will be available to customers. Lastly, our West experts are pleased to be back in person at recently held PDA conference and upcoming CPHI worldwide showcasing our leadership with new scientific insights and technical developments across our portfolio of high-quality drug delivery and devices.\nMoving to Slide 8, with the capital spending investments initiated in 2020 for the larger capacity expansion, we continue to drive forward to complete the installation of our 2021 expansions and initiate the next tranche of investment earlier this year. You can see from the pictures how impressive the ongoing expansions are across our sites. While they do not happen overnight, we are making good progress and expect all these investments will result in several billion units of increased capacity for our HVP components.\nNow I'll turn our call over to Bernard.\n\nBernard J. Birkett\n\nSenior VP and Chief Financial & Operations Officer, West Pharmaceutical Services, Inc.\n\nThank you, Eric, and good morning. So let's review the numbers in more detail. We'll first look at Q3 2022 revenues and profits where we saw mid-single-digit organic sales growth, led by performance in our Biologics and Generics market units. I will take you through the profit drivers in the quarter as well as some balance sheet takeaways. And finally, we will provide an update to our 2022 guidance.\nFirst up, Q3. Our financial results are summarized on Slide 9 and the reconciliation of non-U.S. GAAP measures are described on Slides 18 to 21. We recorded net sales of $686.9 million, representing organic sales growth of 4.3%.\nLooking at Slide 10. Proprietary Products sales grew organically by 5.5% in the quarter. High-value products, which made up approximately 72% of proprietary product sales in the quarter, grew mid-single digits and had growth across our biologics and generic market units in Q3. Looking at the performance of market units, the biologics market unit delivered mid-single-digit growth. We continue to work with many biotech and biopharma customers who are using West and Daikyo high-value products. The generics market unit also experienced mid-single-digit growth, led by sales of Westar components. Our Pharma market unit saw low single-digit growth with sales led by high-value products, including NovaPure and Westar components.\nContract Manufacturing declined 1.2% for the third quarter due to a reduction in sales of components for diagnostic devices. We reported $268 million in gross profit, $20.2 million or 7% below Q3 of last year. Our gross profit margin of 39% was a 180 basis point decline from the same period last year. We saw a 2% increase in adjusted operating profit with $186.4 million recorded this quarter compared to $182.8 million in the same period last year. And our adjusted profit margin of 27.1% was a 120 basis point increase from the same period last year.\nFinally, adjusted diluted EPS declined $0.03 for Q3, excluding stock-based compensation tax benefit EPS increased by approximately $0.05 and foreign currency negatively impacted our EPS by approximately $0.16 in the quarter.\nSo let's review the drivers in both the revenue and profit performance. On Slide 11, we show the contributions to sales decline in the quarter. Volume and mix decreased by approximately $1 million in the quarter, net of approximately $20 million decrease in COVID sales. Sales price increases contributed $31.1 million or 4.4 percentage points in the quarter. Foreign currency generated approximately $49.8 million headwind on our revenue in the quarter. Looking at margin performance. Slide 12 shows our consolidated gross profit margin of 39% for Q3 2022 down from 40.8% in Q3 2021. Proprietary Products third quarter gross profit margin of 43.6% was 270 basis points lower than the margin achieved in the third quarter of 2021. The decline in Proprietary Products gross profit margin was caused by a few key factors: delays in equipment expansion projects, which led to production bottlenecks in certain -- in meeting certain customer demand.\nCustomer demand mix shift led to a greater-than-anticipated impact due to the delays mentioned above as well as continued inflationary pressures on our planned costs, including raw materials, labor, overheads and transportation. Partially offsetting these headwinds on our margin were sales price increases of 180 basis points of benefit associated with onetime fees from COVID supply agreements. Contract Manufacturing third quarter gross profit margin of 17.3% was 120 basis points above the margin achieved in the third quarter of 2021. The increase in margin is largely attributed to price increases in the period and production efficiencies.\nNow let's look at our balance sheet and review how we've done in terms of generating more cash for the business. On Slide 13, we have listed some key cash flow metrics. Operating cash flow was $493.2 million for the 9 months ended September 2022, an increase of $70 million compared to the same period last year, a 16.5% increase. Our operating cash flow in the 9-month period benefited from our working capital performance. Our third quarter 2022 year-to-date capital spending was $189.7 million, $12.8 million higher than the same period last year. Working capital of approximately $1.27 billion at September 30, 2022, increased by $129 million from December 31, 2021, primarily due to increase in inventory and reductions in our accounts payable.\nOur cash balance at September 30 of $729 million was $33.6 million lower than our December 2021 balance. The decrease in cash is primarily due to our share repurchase program, a $43.7 million scheduled payment of debt principal and interest in the third quarter and higher CapEx, offset by our operating cash flow in the period.\nTurning to guidance. Slide 14 provides a high-level summary. We are updating our full year 2022 net sales guidance and expect net sales to be in a range of $2.83 billion to $2.84 billion compared to our prior guidance range of $2.95 billion to $2.975 billion. There is an estimated fourth quarter headwind, $60 million based on current foreign exchange rates. We expect organic sales growth to be approximately 7% compared to prior guidance of approximately 11%. We expect our full year 2022 adjusted diluted EPS guidance to be in a range of $8.15 to $8.20 compared to a prior range of $9 to $9.15. This revised guidance includes our $0.16 EPS positive impact of tax benefits from stock-based compensation during the 9-month period.\nAlso, we are updating our CapEx guidance to $300 million to $320 million compared to our prior estimate of $380 million for the year. There are some key elements I want to bring your attention to as you review our guidance. Estimated FX headwind on EPS in the fourth quarter was an approximately $0.17 headwind. We expect full year COVID-19-related sales to be approximately $85 million lower than 2021 sales, unchanged from our prior guidance. And our guidance excludes future tax benefits from stock-based compensation.\nI would now like to turn the call back over to Eric.\n\nEric M. Green\n\nChair, President & CEO, West Pharmaceutical Services, Inc.\n\nThank you, Bernard. To summarize Slide 15. Looking ahead, with a sharpened focus, we continue to ensure our growth strategy is bringing value to our customers. Our committed order book remains robust. We continue to capture the benefits of the globalization of our operating network and delivering products in this complex environment, and we're continuing to drive forward the capital investments across our operations to meet current and anticipated future growth.\nGigi, we're ready to take questions. Thank you."

Welcome to West Pharmaceutical Services First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]\nPlease note that today's conference may be recorded. I will now hand the conference over to your speaker host Quintin Lai, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nQuintin J. Lai\n\nAnalyst, Robert W. Baird & Co. Equity Capital Markets\n\nThank you, Olivia. Good morning, and welcome to West's First Quarter 2024 Conference Call. We issued our financial results this morning and the release has been posted in the Investors section on the company's website located at westpharma.com. This morning, we will review our financial results, provide an update on our business and present an updated financial outlook for the full year 2024. There is a slide presentation that accompanies today's call and a copy of that presentation is available on the Investors section of our website.\nOn Slide 4 is our safe harbor statement.

The Reconciliations and limitations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable financial results prepared in conformity to GAAP are provided in this morning's earnings release. I now turn the call over to our CEO, Eric Green.\n\nEric M. Green\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, West Pharmaceutical Services, Inc.\n\nThank you, Quintin, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. We will start on Slide 5, where I'd like to cover a few topics. First, we will review Q1 performance. Second, we will provide an update on the markets that we serve as well as updates on our growth initiatives. And third, we will provide an update to our full year 2024 financial outlook.\nNow turning to the financial results. We delivered a solid start to the year. During the quarter, we again saw growth in our top-tier HVP component, NovaPure, and our HVP devices such as SmartDose. We also continued to see inventory management or destocking by our larger mature customers that are working down their inventory closer to pre-pandemic levels. With that said, Q1 had a solid start due to favorable order timing of customer deliveries fulfilled in the quarter.\nI want to address the question that many of you are asking, are we seeing an inflection in destocking? The short answer is not quite yet. Several customers are still working through their safety stock levels, and we still expect Q2 to have an impact from customer destocking and customer order trends continue to indicate a stronger second half of 2024 with a return to more typical order patterns in Q4. Therefore, after a solid quarter, we maintain our full year net sales guidance.\nTurning to Slide 6. We continue to have an active year of capital expansion projects that are increasing capacity to meet growing demand for both our proprietary products and contract manufacturing segments. In our Proprietary Products segment, we have expansion projects in several of our HVP components manufacturing sites, such as Jersey Shore, Kinston, Waterford and [ Ash wider. ] These projects will provide a combination of increased manufacturing capacity, especially HVP processing, washing, sterilization and envision as well as bring a higher level of global standardization throughout our network. We believe that this favorably positions West to address anticipated growing demand for HVP components from volume growth of legacy drugs, from recently launched or to be launched drugs and potential conversions from legacy customers to higher levels of quality in response to the global regulatory changes.\nLast quarter, we mentioned one such regulatory change was the European Union GMP and X1. We continue to emphasize that adoption, both timing and level of HVP will vary from customer to customer and from drug to drug. What we are seeing in Q1 is an acceleration of interest from customers as Annex 1 calls for higher quality, lower particulate and more stabilized solutions. Earlier this month at the INTERPHEX conference in New York, Annex 1was a key topic of discussion with customers as we highlighted our innovative approach and leading products of Westar Select and NovaPure. Also, in the Proprietary Products segment, we're making progress with capacity expansion of our HVP devices including SmartDose, SelfDose and admin systems. For the near term, we're working to layer in capacity through productivity optimization programs. And for the longer term, we are adding capacity that incorporates automation to complement our manual processes.\nWith our contract manufacturing, we continue to build out capacity at our Grand Rapids site and significant expansion at our Dublin facility, which are both in support of our customer's injection device platform. These expansions are critical to the overall volume growth that we continue to experience with growing demand for certain components associated with drugs for diabetes and obesity.\nShifting to Slide 7. We're maintaining our full year 2024 organic sales growth outlook of 2% to 3%. Our teams are actively engaged in working through our customers' inventory management. We expect improved growth along with stronger gross and operating margins in the second half of the year, with Q4 projected to be the strongest quarter. For the full year, we are maintaining general core cost discipline while reinvesting into new growth initiatives, as I have just outlined. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Bernard. Bernard?\n\nBernard J. Birkett\n\nSenior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, West Pharmaceutical Services, Inc.\n\nThank you, Eric, and good morning. Let's review the numbers in more detail. We'll first look at Q1 2024 revenues and profits, where as expected, we saw a low single-digit decrease in organic sales, the decline in operating profit and diluted EPS compared to the first quarter of 2023, given the current market dynamics. I will take you through the drivers impacting sales and margin in the quarter as well as some balance sheet takeaways. And finally, we will provide an update to our 2024 guidance.\nFirst up, Q1. Our financial results are summarized on Slide 8, and the reconciliation of non-U.S. GAAP measures are described in Slides 15 to 18. We recorded net sales of $695.4 million, representing an organic sales decline of 3%. Looking at Slide 9. Proprietary Products organic net sales decreased 4% in the quarter. High-value products, which made up 72% of proprietary product sales in the quarter declined by low single digits primarily due to decreased sales from our FluroTec products and Westar components. Looking at the performance of the market units, the Biologics market unit delivered low single-digit growth, led primarily by sales of NovaPure. The pharma market unit saw a high single-digit decline, primarily due to a reduction in sales of Envision and standard components while the generics market unit declined double digits, primarily due to decreased sales from our Westar and FluroTec components. Our Contract Manufacturing segment experienced low single-digit net sales growth in the first quarter primarily driven by an increase in sales of components associated with diagnostic devices. Our adjusted operating profit margin, 17.7% was a 530 basis point decrease from the same period last year. Finally, adjusted diluted EPS declined 21.2% for Q1. Excluding stock-based compensation tax benefit, EPS decreased by approximately 23%.\nNow let's review the drivers in both our revenue and profit performance. On Slide 10, we showed the contribution to organic sales decline in the quarter. Sales price increases contributed $24.1 million, a 3.4 percentage points of growth in the quarter as did a foreign currency tailwind of approximately $3.4 million. More than offsetting price was a negative volume and mix impact of $45.5 million primarily due to lower sales volume caused by customer inventory management decisions in the period.\nLooking at margin performance. Slide 11 shows our consolidated gross profit margin of 33.1% of Q1 2024, down from 37.9% in Q1 2023. Proprietary Products first quarter gross profit margin of 37% was 550 basis points lower than the margin achieved in the first quarter of 2023. The key drivers for the decline in Proprietary Products gross profit margin with lower sales volume and an unfavorable mix of products sold, partially offset by increased sales prices. Contract Manufacturing first quarter gross profit margin of 17% was 60 basis points below the margin achieved in the first quarter of 2023, primarily due to inflationary labor costs and an unfavorable mix of products sold, partially offset by increased sales prices.\nNow let's look at our balance sheet and review how we've done in terms of generating cash for the business. On Slide 12, we have listed some key cash flow metrics. Operating cash flow was $118.2 million for the 3 months ended March 2024, a decrease of $19.9 million compared to the same period last year, a 14.4% decrease primarily due to a decline in operating results. Our first quarter 2024 year-to-date capital spending was $90.6 million, $8.5 million higher than the same period last year. We continue to leverage our CapEx to increase both our high-value products and/or contract manufacturing capacity. Working capital of approximately $1.04 billion at March 31, 2024, decreased by $220.1 million on December 31, 2023 primarily due to a reduction in our cash balance. Our cash balance at March 31, 2024 was $601.8 million, was $252.1 million lower than our December 2023 balance. The decrease in cash is primarily due to $267 million of share repurchases and/or capital expenditures offset by cash from operations.\nTurning to guidance. Slide 7 provides a high-level summary. We are reaffirming our full year 2024 net sales guidance in the range of $3 billion to $3.025 billion. There is an estimated full year 2024 headwind of approximately $8 million based on current foreign exchange rates. We expect organic sales growth to be approximately 2% to 3%, unchanged from prior guidance. We are raising our full year 2024 adjusted diluted EPS guidance to be in a range of $7.63 to $7.88, compared to a prior range of $7.50 to $7.75. Also, our CapEx guidance of $350 million for the year, unchanged from prior guidance. There are some key elements I want to bring your attention to as you review our guidance. Full year 2024 adjusted diluted EPS guidance range includes an estimated FX headwind of approximately $0.04 based on current foreign currency exchange rate, which is an increase from the prior guidance of $0.02. The updated guidance also includes EPS of $0.15 associated with first quarter 2024 tax benefits from stock-based compensation. Our guidance excludes future tax benefits from stock-based compensation. I would now like to turn the call back over to Eric.\n\nEric M. Green\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, West Pharmaceutical Services, Inc.\n\nThank you, Bernard. To summarize on Slide 13, the solid financial performance and execution in Q1 continues to reaffirm our proven growth strategy, strong base business and the unique value of our high-quality product offerings for customers. We look forward to building on this momentum as we move through the year, and our team is steadfast in meeting the anticipated growth expectations as we make a positive impact on health care across the globe. Olivia, we're ready to take questions. Thank you."

Welcome to the Q1 West Pharmaceutical Services Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions)\nI would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Quintin Lai, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nQuintin J. Lai\n\nVP of Strategy & IR, West Pharmaceutical Services, Inc.\n\nThank you, Didi. Good morning, and welcome to West's First Quarter 2022 Conference Call. We issued our financial results this morning, and the release has been posted in the Investors section on the company's website located at westpharma.com. This morning, CEO, Eric Green; and CFO, Bernard Birkett, will review our financial results, provide an update on our business and present an update on our financial outlook for the full year of 2022.\nThere's a slide presentation that accompanies today's call, and a copy of that presentation is available on the Investors section of our website. On Slide 4 is our safe harbor statement. Statements made by management on this call and in the accompanying presentation contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of U.S. federal securities law. These statements are based on our beliefs and assumptions, current expectations, estimates and forecasts.\nFuture results are influenced by many factors beyond the control of the company. Actual results could differ materially from past results as well as those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statement made here. Please refer to today's press release as well as any other disclosures made by the company regarding the risk to which it is subject, including our 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports.\nDuring today's call, management will make reference to non-GAAP financial measures, including organic sales growth, adjusted operating profit, adjusted operating profit margin and adjusted diluted EPS. Reconciliations and limitations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable financial results prepared in conformity to GAAP are provided in this morning's earnings release.\nI now turn the call over to West CEO and President, Eric Green. Eric?\n\nEric M. Green\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, West Pharmaceutical Services, Inc.\n\nThank you, Quintin, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. We will start on Slide 5.\nI'm pleased to report that we delivered a strong first quarter. This was driven by double-digit organic sales growth with increasing demand for our high-value products. Our confirmed order book for the rest of 2022 and into 2023 remains as strong as ever, primarily driven by non-COVID-based business. And to provide you more color, over half of the order book is coming from biologics demand.\nThese results were delivered despite several macroeconomic challenges that are impacting all companies and sectors. We have taken proactive measures to mitigate the risk of these challenges and ensure the continuity of critical components to our customers. For example, inflation. We're adjusting our pricing strategy and have enacted surcharges as a pass-through to offset increasing costs of raw materials, energy and transportation. Supply chain. Our raw material and proprietary medical device components are sourced from across the globe. We have increased our inventory of these key raw materials to minimize any supply disruption. And we continue to execute and monitor our business continuity plans with respect to these issues, including the war in Ukraine and the recent pandemic surge in China.\nTurning to Slide 6. Our team members across the globe continue to demonstrate their passion to improve patient lives as they remain focused on our strategic initiatives of execute, innovate and grow. Starting with the first pillar of execute.\nWe continue to deliver the key drivers of growth in Q1 with strong customer demand of HVP components, including NovaPure and Westar. There was solid demand in the quarter across all market units and a positive outlook remains for the rest of the year. And in particular, for our Biologics market segment, which is now greater than 42% of our total sales, we see both existing and new customers continue to spec our highest level of components by West or our partner Daikyo for their sensitive molecules.\nOur capital spending investments through expansions and optimizing productivity across the global operations remain on track. To date, almost all of our 2020 expansion phases have been installed, validated and in production, and we're making good progress on the 2021 capital expansion plans, some of which will come online in the second half of 2022 and throughout 2023. With the accelerated biologics demand for NovaPure, we have executed additional support for NovaPure future demand as well as other HVP finishing capabilities. Expansion construction is underway and will be online towards the back half of this year with commercial production in 2023.\nShifting to West team of scientific and technical experts. We continue to educate and share insights in biologics, combination products and container closure integrity, which are priority areas in pharmaceutical packaging. At the recent PDA Annual Meeting, several of our West experts were recipients of prestigious awards.\nNow to innovate. We need to fuel innovation to develop future products, solutions and services that connect the dots across science and technology to create customer value. We're doing so by investing in external opportunities that complement our current business needs such as our partnership with TECHIN to create a research center of excellence in combination with West scientific expertise, the Corning collaboration as we expand our HVP value proposition to lead the industry from components to a truly integrated system of elastomer-glass and building technologies like the recent collaboration with Pneuma Systems to develop a family of fluid flow technologies for drug delivery. I'm pleased of the progress our R&D team is making around innovate.\nMoving to the final pillar, growth, which includes uses of cash. We're working from a position of strength as we believe we have a long horizon of continued strong organic sales growth and margin expansion. As we have demonstrated over the past 2 years, we have increased our capital spending for capacity expansion at existing sites across our global network to support our organic growth initiatives. In addition, we have made inorganic investments such as partnerships with Corning.\nOur continued focus within these 3 strategic pillars, execute, innovate and grow, allows us to be more responsive, leverage our assets more effectively and support the trends that are happening in the industry today. This was most evident from our recent site visits in Dublin and Waterford, Ireland. For example, in Dublin, I saw firsthand how the digitalization of our manufacturing technologies is providing real-time data, enabling our team to raise the bar in operational performance with higher yields and efficiencies.\nAt Waterford, the capital investments over the last 1.5 years have significantly increased capacity with additional lines producing HVP product to meet increased demand. And we're seeing early success with our next-generation fully integrated automation that we believe will scale and transfer across the network for a combined benefit of higher quality production and higher manufacturing throughput. Lastly and proudly, the hard work of our Waterford team was acknowledged by the Ireland-U.S. Council as we received the Global Public Service Award for our commitment during the pandemic.\nNow I'll turn it over to our CFO, Bernard Birkett, who will provide more detail on our financial performance.\n\nBernard J. Birkett\n\nSenior VP & CFO, West Pharmaceutical Services, Inc.\n\nThank you, Eric, and good morning. Let's review the numbers in more detail. We'll first look at Q1 2022 revenues and profits where we saw continued strong sales and EPS growth, led by strong revenue performance in our Biologics and Pharma market units. I will take you through the profit growth we saw in the quarter as well as some balance sheet takeaways. And finally, we will provide an update to our 2022 guidance.\nFirst up, Q1. Our financial results are summarized on Slide 7, and the reconciliation of non-U.S. GAAP measures are described in Slides 15 to 18. We recorded net sales of $720 million, representing organic sales growth of 11%.\nLooking at Slide 8. Proprietary Products sales grew organically by 14.4% in the quarter. High-value products, which made up approximately 73% of Proprietary Products sales in the quarter, grew double digits and had solid momentum across Biologics and Pharma market units in Q1.\nLooking at the performance of the market units, the Biologics market unit delivered strong double-digit growth. We continue to work with many biotech and biopharma customers who are using West and Daikyo high-value product offerings. The Generics market unit experienced mid-single-digit growth, led by sales of FluroTec and Westar components. Our Pharma market unit saw high single-digit growth with sales, led by high-value products, including Daikyo and NovaPure components. And Contract Manufacturing declined 3.8% for the first quarter due to a reduction in sales of components for diagnostic devices.\nWe recorded $284.6 million in gross profit, $12.7 million or 4.7% above Q1 of last year. And our gross profit margin of 39.5% was a 100 basis point decline from the same period last year. We saw improvement in adjusted operating profit with $189.9 million recorded this quarter compared to $179.2 million in the same period last year or a 6% increase. However, our adjusted operating profit margin of 26.4% was a 30 basis point decrease from the same period last year. Finally, adjusted diluted EPS grew 12% for Q1. Excluding stock-based compensation tax benefit of $0.12 in Q1, EPS grew by approximately 15%.\nSo let's review the drivers in both revenue and profit. On Slide 9, we show the contributions to sales growth in the quarter. Volume and mix contributed $49.9 million or 7.4 percentage points of growth. And sales price increases contributed $23.6 million or 3.5 percentage points of growth in the quarter.\nLooking at margin performance. Slide 10 shows our consolidated gross profit margin of 39.5% for Q1 2022, slightly down from 40.5% in Q1 2021. Proprietary Products first quarter gross profit margin of 43.4% was 290 basis points lower than the margin achieved in the first quarter of 2021. The decline in Proprietary Products gross profit margin was caused by several factors, including lower levels of absorption during the early part of the quarter due to short-term labor constraints, increases in raw material and overhead costs. In addition, our 2021 gross profit margin included approximately 150 basis points of benefit in the prior year associated with onetime fees from COVID and other supply agreements, which did not reoccur in the first quarter of 2022. These fees had approximately 160 basis points of benefit on Q1 2021 operating margin.\nContract Manufacturing first quarter gross profit margin of 20.1% was 440 basis points above the margin achieved in the first quarter of 2021. The increase in margin is largely attributed to pass-through of inflationary costs and components in the quarter.\nNow let's look at our balance sheet and review how we've done in terms of generating more cash for the business. On Slide 11, we have listed some key cash flow metrics. Operating cash flow was $151.2 million for the first quarter of 2022, an increase of $62.5 million compared to the same period last year, 70.5% increase. Our operating cash flow in the period benefited from our working capital performance.\nOur first quarter 2022 year-to-date capital spending was $65.8 million, $11.1 million higher than the same period last year. Working capital of approximately $1.1 billion at March 31, 2022, decreased slightly by $42.2 million from December 31, 2021, primarily due to the net reduction of our cash, offset by an increase in inventory levels. Our cash balance at March 31 of $667.7 million was $94.9 million lower than our December 2021 balance. The decrease in cash is primarily due to our share repurchase program and higher CapEx, offset by our strong operating results in the period.\nTurning to guidance. Slide 12 provides a high-level summary. We are reaffirming our full year 2022 net sales guidance. We expect net sales to be in a range of $3.05 billion to $3.075 billion. There is an estimated FX headwind of $115 million based on current foreign exchange rates compared to a prior estimated headwind of $70 million. We expect organic sales growth to be in the range of 11% to 12% compared to our prior guidance of approximately 10%.\nWe expect our full year 2022 adjusted diluted EPS guidance to be in a range of $9.30 to $9.45 compared to a prior range of $9.20 to $9.35. This revised guidance includes first quarter $0.12 EPS positive impact of tax benefits from stock-based compensation. Also, our CapEx guidance remains at $380 million for the year.\nThere are some key elements I want to bring your attention to as you review our guidance. Estimated FX headwind on EPS has an increased impact of approximately $0.38 based on current foreign currency exchange rates compared to a prior estimated headwind of $0.21. And our guidance excludes future tax benefits from stock-based compensation. So to summarize the key takeaways for the first quarter: strong top line growth in proprietary, growth in operating profit, growth in adjusted diluted EPS and growth in operating cash flow, delivering in line with our pillars of execute, innovate and grow.\nI'd now like to turn the call back over to Eric.\n\nEric M. Green\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, West Pharmaceutical Services, Inc.\n\nThank you, Bernard. To summarize on Slide 13, our execution in Q1 has positioned us well for the year ahead. We continue to have a strong base business despite the current macro environment in which we operate. We remain well positioned with the right market-led strategy around execute, innovate and grow.\nWe have a robust book of committed orders with momentum in 2022 and continuing into 2023. We continue to realize the benefits of our global operating model, and we're continuing to accelerate capital spending across our operations to meet current and anticipated future growth. With great pride, we realize the criticality of our products for health care across the globe, which is why our purpose to improve patient lives propels us each and every day.\nDidi, we're ready to take questions. Thank you."

Baird & Co. Equity Capital Markets\n\nConference call. We issued our financial results this morning, and the release has been posted in the Investors section on the company's website located at westpharma.com.\nThis morning, Eric Green and Bernard Birkett will review our financial results, provide an update on our business and present an update on our financial outlook for the full year 2023. There's a slide presentation that accompanies today's call and a copy of that presentation is available on the Investors section of our website.\nOn Slide 4, our safe harbor statement.

Reconciliations and limitations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable financial results prepared in conformity to GAAP are provided in this morning's earnings release.\nI now turn the call over to our CEO, Eric Green. Eric?\n\nEric M. Green\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, West Pharmaceutical Services, Inc.\n\nGreat. Thank you, Quintin, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today.\nWe will start on Slide 5. On April 14, West turned 100 years old. This is a major milestone that we're very proud of. Over the course of our 100-year history, the West name has come to mean so much to so many people.\nI would like to recognize our founder, Herman O. West, and the past generations of leadership that have built West to who we are today. In addition, I want to especially thank our 10,000-plus team members who are motivated by our purpose of improving patient lives and making a difference in the communities in which we work and live.\nMoving to Slide 6. I am pleased to report that we delivered a solid first quarter. This was driven by overall organic sales growth of over 2%. Excluding COVID-19, our base organic sales grew high teens. Our end markets remain stable even in this uncertain macroeconomic environment. As expected, we saw a drop in COVID-19-related sales compared to last year. That said, our Biologics market unit, excluding COVID, again grew double digits, and we expect this trend to continue for the rest of the year.\nWith a focus on reprioritization of longer lead time components, our Generics and Pharma market units delivered an especially strong quarter of double-digit organic growth. In addition, our Contract Manufacturing had solid growth while delivering components for injection-related devices.\nThis overall performance is a result of our team members across the globe as they remain focused on our strategic initiative of execute, innovate and grow. The resiliency of the business continues to be a reflection of our team members, and I want to acknowledge these efforts and say thank you.\nTurning to Slide 7. In addition to our financial performance, there were several other significant accomplishments in our quarter. I would like to highlight a few. In February, we opened our new R&D lab in Radnor, Pennsylvania. This investment supports our capability enhancements while meeting the growing needs of customers in the changing regulatory environment across the globe. The lab supplied research will include containment and systems for advanced therapies and biomaterials, along with advanced design and engineering for drug delivery.\nIn addition, the lab will also test and develop elastomer glass systems, and the work done here will support our future R&D ambitions for new containment and packaging solutions.\nOur product innovations have been recognized with several notable awards, including the Best Technologies Award at Interphex for our West Ready Pack with Corning's Valor ready-to-use vials. And as we continue to make tremendous strides in ESG, we have announced a stability partnership with the Philadelphia Eagles who are recognized as environmental stewards across all areas of their business. We look forward to sharing more detail on our ESG efforts in our corporate responsibility report to be published shortly.\nShifting to Slide 8. A robust capital investments through expansions and optimizing productivity across our global operations remain on track. We continue to drive forward the expansion of additional HVP capacity with the anticipated growth of our customers' biologic portfolios and drug launches. This includes the installation and validation of new manufacturing equipment for HVP plungers and finishing capabilities, which will continue to come online throughout 2023 and into 2024.\nMoving to Slide 9. We are reiterating our full year 2023 organic sales growth outlook of 3% to 4% and are raising our 2023 financial outlook for overall net sales and adjusted diluted EPS. While Bernard will go over more details in his remarks, I want to make a few high-level comments. We continue to see a decline in overall COVID-19 sales and now expect $60 million for the full year 2023 instead of $85 million.\nEven with this change, we are reaffirming full year 2023 overall organic sales guidance. We continue to expect mid-teens Proprietary Products base organic sales growth for the year. Contract Manufacturing is now expected to be double-digit growth compared to prior high single-digit outlook as we expect to see continued demand for certain injection devices as seen in Q1.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Bernard. Bernard?\n\nBernard J. Birkett\n\nSenior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, West Pharmaceutical Services, Inc.\n\nThank you, Eric, and good morning. We'll first look at Q1 2023 revenues and profits, where we saw low single-digit organic sales growth and a decline in operating profit and diluted EPS compared to the first quarter of 2022. I will take you through the drivers impacting sales and margin in the quarter as well as some balance sheet takeaways. And finally, we will provide an update to our 2023 guidance.\nFirst up, Q1. Our financial results are summarized on Slide 10, and the reconciliation of non-U.S. GAAP measures are described in Slides 17 to 20. We recorded net sales of $716.6 million, representing organic sales growth of 2.3%.\nCOVID-related net revenues are estimated to have been approximately $23 million in the quarter, an approximate $88 million reduction compared to the prior year. These net revenues in 2022 include our assessment of components associated with vaccines, treatment and diagnosis of COVID-19 patients, offset by lower sales to customers affected by lower volumes due to the pandemic.\nLooking at Slide 11, Proprietary Products organic net sales remained flat in the quarter. High-value products, which made up more than 70% of Proprietary Product sales in the quarter, declined by low single digits due to the reduction in COVID-related net revenues.\nLooking at the performance of the market units, the Generics market unit delivered high double digits growth led by sales of Westar components, while the Pharma market unit experienced low double-digit growth led by Envision and Westar components as well as Admin Systems. And the Biologics market unit saw double-digit -- saw a double-digit decline due to a reduction in sales related to COVID-19 vaccine.\nOur Contract Manufacturing segment experienced double-digit net sales growth in the first quarter, primarily driven by an increase in sales of components related to injection-related devices. Our adjusted operating profit margin of 23% was a 340 basis point decrease from the same period last year.\nFinally, adjusted diluted EPS declined 13.9% for Q1. Excluding stock-based compensation tax benefits, EPS decreased by approximately 16.1%.\nNow let's review the drivers in both our revenue and profit performance. On Slide 12, we show the contributions to organic sales growth in the quarter. Sales price increases contributed $38 million or 5.3 percentage points of growth in the quarter. Offsetting price was a negative mix impact of $21.3 million, primarily due to a reduction in COVID-19-related net demand and a foreign currency headwind of approximately $20.1 million.\nLooking at margin performance, Slide 13 shows our consolidated gross profit margin of 37.9% for Q1 2023, down from 39.5% in Q1 2022. Proprietary Products first quarter gross profit margin of 42.5% was 90 basis points lower than the margin achieved in the first quarter of 2022.\nThe key drivers for the decline in Proprietary Products gross profit margin were unfavorable mix from a reduction in sales related to COVID-19 vaccines and continued inflationary pressures on our planned costs, including labor, raw materials and overheads. These factors were partially offset by sales price increases and production efficiencies.\nContract Manufacturing first quarter gross profit margin of 17.6% was 250 basis points below the margin achieved in the first quarter of 2022, primarily due to mix of products sold.\nNow let's look at our balance sheet and review how we've done in terms of generating more cash. On Slide 14, we have listed some key cash flow metrics. Operating cash flow was $138.1 million for the 3 months ended March 2023, a decrease of $13.1 million compared to the same period last year, an 8.7% decrease, primarily due to a decline in operating results.\nOur first quarter of 2023 year-to-date capital spending was $82.1 million, $16.3 million higher than the same period last year. We continue to leverage our CapEx to increase our high-value product manufacturing capacity within our existing facilities in the U.S., Germany, Ireland and Singapore.\nWorking capital of approximately $1.4 billion at March 31, 2023, remained consistent from December 31, 2022. Our cash balance at March 31 of $886.3 million was $8 million lower than our December 2022 balance. The decrease in cash is primarily due to our share repurchase program and higher CapEx, offset by operating cash flow for the first quarter.\nTurning to guidance, Slide 9 provides a high-level summary. We are updating our full year 2023 net sales guidance and expect net sales to be in a range of $2.965 billion to $2.99 billion compared to our prior guidance range of $2.935 billion to $2.96 billion. There is an estimated full year 2023 tailwind of $15 million based on current foreign exchange rates compared to prior guidance of the 2023 headwind of $30 million.\nWe expect organic sales growth to be approximately 3% to 4%, unchanged from prior guidance. We expect our full year 2023 adjusted diluted EPS guidance to be in a range of $7.50 to $7.65 compared to a prior range of $7.25 to $7.40. Also, our CapEx guidance is $350 million for the year, unchanged from prior guidance.\nThere are some key elements I want to bring your attention to as you review our guidance. We expect full year COVID-19-related sales to be approximately $60 million compared to prior guidance of approximately $85 million. Net sales guidance also includes a reduction of $8 million, resulting from an expected divestiture of a European facility that produced standard Proprietary Product components.\nFull year 2023 adjusted diluted EPS guidance range includes an estimated FX tailwind of approximately $0.02 based on current foreign currency exchange rates compared to prior guidance of a headwind of $0.11. The updated guidance also includes EPS of $0.15 associated with first quarter 2023 tax benefits from stock-based compensation. Our guidance does not include potential future tax benefits from stock-based compensation.\nI would now like to turn the call back over to Eric.\n\nEric M. Green\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, West Pharmaceutical Services, Inc.\n\nThank you, Bernard.\nTo summarize, on Slide 15, the solid financial performance and execution in Q1 continues to reaffirm we have a strong base business and are delivering unique value to our customers. While there may be instability in some small cash-dependent biotechs, these customers are not a substantial portion of our business.\nOur end markets remain stable, and there continues to be a promising pipeline of new drugs that could have meaningful launches and/or expansions over the next few years, which means more HVP sales opportunities for West. Our global operations team is efficiently manufacturing and delivering products in this complex environment with a focus on service and quality.\nAnd we're continuing to progress capital spending across our operations to meet current and anticipated future growth. With great pride, we realize this criticality of our products for health care across the globe, which is why our purpose to improve patient lives propels us each and every day.\nNorma, we're ready to take questions. Thank you."

Joining me today are David Goeckeler, Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Eulau, Chief Financial Officer.\nBefore we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements, including product portfolio expectations, business plans and performance, trends and financial outlook based on management's current assumptions and expectations, and as such, does include risks and uncertainties. We assume no obligation to update these statements. Please refer to our most recent financial report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC for more information on the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.\nWe will also make references to non-GAAP financial measures today. Reconciliations between the non-GAAP and comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the press release and other materials that are being posted in the Investor Relations section of our website.\nWith that, I will now turn the call over to David for introductory remarks.\n\nDavid V. Goeckeler\n\nCEO & Director, Western Digital Corporation\n\nThank you, Peter. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the call to discuss our second quarter of fiscal 2022 results.\nWe delivered strong results for the fiscal second quarter with revenue of $4.8 billion and non-GAAP gross margin of 33.6%, both of which are within the guidance range we provided last quarter. Additionally, we reported non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.30, which was ahead of our expectations. I'm proud of the team as this marks the seventh consecutive quarter of meeting or exceeding guidance amid a continuously increasingly challenged supply chain.\nBefore I go over the detailed results and business trends, I want to offer some important key takeaways coming out of calendar year 2021. First, we have made significant progress in strengthening our product portfolio. We delivered on our goals of qualifying our enterprise SSD products at 3 cloud titans and 2 OEMs, commercializing energy-assisted hard drives as well as commencing shipments of 20-terabyte hard drives based on OptiNAND technologies. These products address the large and fast-growing opportunities within the cloud for storage.\nSecond, demand for Western Digital storage solutions across cloud, client and consumer end markets remains consistently strong. We are optimistic about our outlook for calendar year 2022 as our customers continue to indicate solid demand across the end markets we serve. I'll share more about that demand and other macro factors later.\nThird, we are continuing to navigate an increasingly complex supply chain, which is impacting both our customers' ability to ship products as well as our ability to build products. In order to meet our end customers' demand, we are incurring additional costs that will weigh primarily on our hard drive gross margins through the first half of calendar year 2022. These issues are transitory in nature, affecting both revenue and gross margin, and we expect them to subside as the supply chain normalizes. We remain confident that the long-term growth and profitability opportunity in front of us has not changed.\nLastly, we received an investment-grade corporate rating from Fitch in December, which represents Western Digital's second investment-grade corporate rating. This marks an important milestone as we have worked hard over the last 18 months to strengthen our financial position, providing us with greater financial flexibility in the future. As we approach our targeted debt levels, we look forward to reengaging in a capital return program in fiscal year 2023.\nTurning to our results. This past quarter, demand remained strong across our end markets, and our customers and the Western Digital teams continue to work diligently to mitigate the impact of supply chain disruptions. In particular, cloud revenue for the fiscal second quarter increased by 89% from the same period last year. We continue to anticipate strength in storage demand, which is bolstered by our ability to continue to bring innovative new products to market to meet the needs of the digital economy.\nThe potential of what can be accomplished through the creation of content and the ability to access digital information easily has never been greater. With our technology, we are enabling businesses, creators and innovators to think bigger and push their limits even further.\nWestern Digital has built a great position in the large and growing storage markets. Our proven ability to innovate and develop a balanced portfolio, coupled with our broad routes to market, puts Western Digital in a strong position to capitalize on the many growth opportunities ahead of us.\nI'll now recap our HDD and Flash businesses. In HDD, overall cloud end-market product demand remained high with revenue increasing 50% year-over-year led by capacity enterprise hard drives. Although we were up strongly year-over-year, capacity enterprise hard drives declined sequentially after 2 quarters of strong shipments, partly due to some of our customers' supply chain challenges. As both Western Digital or customers continue to face supply chain challenges, we will experience some near-term visibility issues. However, our overall demand signals continue to be very good as we move through the calendar year, and we will be in a stronger position once these headwinds subside.\nDuring the fiscal second quarter, we commenced volume shipments of our 20-terabyte CMR hard drives based on OptiNAND technologies. We are very excited about OptiNAND, a revolutionary technology that utilizes flash in the control plane to further increase areal density. Additionally, we are seeing an increase in customer interest in adopting SMR technology and expect multiple cloud titans to deploy SMR drives in high volume later in this calendar year.\nIn Flash, revenue grew in the second fiscal quarter due to seasonal strength in mobile and consumer. Within mobile, shipments of our BiCS5 products into leading 5G smartphones increased over 60% sequentially and 50% year-over-year, led by strong content growth. BiCS5 shipments represented over 40% of total revenue, and BiCS5 production crossover took place during the quarter as expected. The successful ramp of BiCS5 helped accelerate our overall year-over-year bit shipment growth to 37% in the quarter.\nOur WD_BLACK premium SSD product line optimized for the best gaming experience continues to gain momentum, with revenue increasing about 50% sequentially and doubling in calendar year 2021. Along with flash products for gaming consoles, revenue has grown from 0 to over 10% of our flash portfolio over the last 2 years. As consumers demand more ways to access, generate and store content, whether via gaming or the now emerging metaverse, our strong and growing flash portfolio will be integral to enable all of these applications.\nIn line with the guidance we provided last quarter, our client SSD business declined sequentially due to supply chain disruptions at some of our PC customers and pricing pressure in the more transactional markets. So far, within the current quarter, we are starting to see pricing in the more transactional markets stabilize. As I mentioned earlier, our enterprise SSD products are qualified at 3 cloud titans and 2 major storage OEMs, marking significant progress compared to 1 cloud titan a year ago. As you know, this has been one of my top priorities.\nBuilding upon the early success of ramping BiCS5 into mobile and gaming consoles, we are further strengthening our product portfolio as we move through calendar year 2022. In client SSD, the bedrock of Western Digital's flash portfolio, we have launched and are ramping BiCS5-based products in the fiscal third quarter, with BiCS5 enterprise SSD products later in the year.\nFor our next-generation 3D flash, we began initial commercial shipment of consumer flash devices based on our 162-layer BiCS6. Furthermore, we qualified and commenced revenue shipment of client SSDs based on QLC and BiCS5 technology in the fiscal second quarter. While still early in its evolution, we are starting to pave the way for the industry's adoption of QLC in the future, and our next-generation BiCS6 node will play an important role in that evolution.\nLet me now offer a few observations on the demand environment. The accelerated digital transformation in the last 2 years has created a world that is more technology-enabled and technology-dependent than ever before. We anticipate these trends will continue to drive data storage growth across each end market we serve: cloud, client and consumer. Our customers remain optimistic about demand trends in calendar 2022, driven by capital investment for the cloud build-out, continued recovery in enterprise spending, growth in smart video applications, increased adoption in 5G phones, consumer gaming and emerging trends such as VR/AR devices.\nIn cloud, our customers have announced a 36% year-over-year increase in capital investment for the cloud build-out. This, coupled with an increase in enterprise spending and continued growth in smart video applications, is expected to drive growth for our flash and HDD products into this growing end market.\nIn client, PC end demand has remained strong. Our customers are driving more consistent demand than the past several quarters, and we see continued stabilization in 2022. PC unit shipment forecasts continue to be robust and significantly ahead of prepandemic levels. In addition, we anticipate an eventual return to site to drive a mix shift towards commercial PCs, which tend to offer richer client SSD content versus consumer-oriented PCs.\nIn mobile, the latest 5G phones have doubled NAND content from prior-generation smartphones. We expect mobile device content to benefit as ongoing 5G adoption and new 5G-enabled applications are expected to drive the storage demand in both endpoints in the cloud.\nIn Consumer, the highlight of this end market is our WD_BLACK SSD line of products optimized for gaming enthusiasts. Revenue more than doubled in calendar year 2021. The consumer recognition of the strength and value of WD_BLACK, along with the SanDisk and SanDisk Professional brands, drove a 34% year-over-year growth in average capacity per unit in consumer flash.\nWhile end customer demand in calendar 2022 looks promising, supply chain challenges are increasing. This both limits our ability to source components to meet customer demand and increases component costs. These costs are on top of the ongoing elevated logistics and health and safety COVID costs. While we believe these incremental costs are transitory and will subside as the supply chain conditions normalize, they will impact our results through the first half of this calendar year.\nLet me now turn the call over to Bob, who will discuss our fiscal second quarter results and provide a more detailed outlook for calendar year 2022. Bob?\n\nRobert K. Eulau\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Western Digital Corporation\n\nThanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. As Dave mentioned, overall results for the fiscal second quarter were better than our expectations, marking the seventh consecutive quarter that we've met or exceeded guidance.\nTotal revenue for the quarter was $4.8 billion, down 4% sequentially and up 23% year-over-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $2.30, which exceeded the high end of our guidance range. Please note that this figure includes $70 million in total COVID-related costs, which was higher than we anticipated entering the quarter. I'll provide more details on these costs in a minute, but we are pleased to have delivered such strong results in the face of ongoing supply chain issues and COVID-related challenges.\nIn addition to this solid financial performance, we had a major milestone this quarter in receiving an investment-grade corporate rating from Fitch. This marks the company's second investment-grade corporate rating. We are pleased to see that our work to build a stronger financial foundation is being recognized and is providing us with greater financial flexibility for the future.\nAdditionally, we closed a public debt offering last December and amended our loan agreement with lenders in January, bringing the maturity of over 85% of our debt balance to 2026 and beyond. For more details, please refer to our earnings presentation.\nTurning to our end markets. Cloud represented 40% of total revenue at $1.9 billion, down 14% sequentially and up 89% from a year ago. Supply chain disruptions impacted cloud hard drive deployments at certain customers, which led to a sequential decline in exabyte shipments in the fiscal second quarter. However, healthy overall demand for capacity enterprise drives, along with Western Digital's leadership position at the 18-terabyte capacity point, drove a greater than 50% year-over-year increase in exabyte shipments.\nThe client end market represented 38% of total revenue at $1.9 billion, flat sequentially and down 1% year-over-year. The continued ramp of 5G phones helped offset decline in both client SSD and client hard drive revenue, enabling total client revenue to stay flat. Client hard drives represent less than 15% of our HDD revenue.\nLastly, consumer represented 22% of revenue at $1.1 billion, up 9% sequentially and flat year-over-year. With a strong holiday season, retail flash led the sequential growth in consumer. On a year-over-year basis, growth in consumer flash was offset by a decline in consumer HDD.\nTurning now to revenue by segment. We reported flash revenue of $2.6 billion, up 5% sequentially and up 29% year-over-year. On a blended basis, flash ASPs were down 6% sequentially due to a seasonal increase in shipments to mobile and retail. On a like-for-like basis, flash ASPs were down 3% sequentially. Flash bit shipments increased by 13% sequentially and 37% year-over-year.\nHard drive revenue was $2.2 billion, down 14% sequentially and up 16% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, total hard drive exabyte shipments decreased by 14%, while the average price per hard drive decreased by 5% to $97. On a year-over-year basis, total hard drive exabyte shipments increased by 27%.\nAs we move to costs and expenses, please note that my comments will be related to non-GAAP results unless stated otherwise. Gross margin for the second quarter was 33.6%, down 0.3 percentage points sequentially. As noted earlier, the COVID-related impact was $10 million higher than we anticipated at $70 million.\nOur flash gross margin was 36.1%, down 0.9 percentage points sequentially. This included COVID-related impact of $10 million or approximately 0.4 percentage points. Our hard drive gross margin was 30.6%, down 0.3 percentage points sequentially. This included COVID-related impact of $60 million or approximately 2.7 percentage points.\nOperating expenses of $741 million were below our guidance range due to prudent cost control and lower variable compensation expense. Operating income was $882 million, representing a 7% decrease from the prior quarter and 157% increase year-over-year, highlighting our ability to drive profitable growth. Earnings per share was $2.30, which exceeded the high end of our guidance range.\nOperating cash flow for the second quarter was $666 million, and free cash flow was $407 million. Despite a slight increase in inventory due to supply chain disruption, we maintained strong cash flow generation in the quarter.\nCapital expenditures, which include the purchase of property, plant and equipment and activity related to our flash joint ventures on our cash flow statement, was a cash outflow of $259 million. We remain prudent in investing in manufacturing capacity and continue to expect gross CapEx for the current fiscal year to be around $3 billion. We now expect cash CapEx to be around $1.5 billion as we actively manage our overall spending.\nAs we mentioned on our last earnings call, we fully repaid our Term Loan B in the amount of $943 million last October. In addition, last December, we closed a public offering of $1 billion in senior unsecured notes and repaid $1.3 billion on our Term Loan A, bringing our gross debt outstanding to $7.4 billion at the end of the fiscal second quarter.\nOn top of that, earlier this month, we entered into an agreement with our lenders to revise the terms of our loan agreement to reflect our improved credit ratings and to extend the maturity of our term loan and revolving credit facility from 2023 to 2027. Our trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA at the end of the second quarter as defined in our credit agreement was $4.8 billion, resulting in a gross leverage ratio of 1.5x. This compares to 3.0x in the third fiscal quarter of 2020, when we announced the plan to focus on debt repayment to achieve greater financial flexibility.\nAs a reminder, our credit agreement includes $1 billion in depreciation add-back associated with the flash ventures. This is not reflected in our cash flow statement. Please refer to our earnings presentation on the Investor Relations website for further details.\nConsidering the transitory supply chain challenges we discussed earlier, I would like to provide a bit more color on our view of both hard drive and Flash businesses in calendar 2022. Within our hard drive segment, we expect hard drive revenue to decrease on a sequential basis in the third fiscal quarter. While the supply chain disruptions at some of our customers are expected to remain, the larger issue of late has been our ability to source components to meet customer demand. We expect revenue to return to sequential growth in the fiscal fourth quarter.\nWhile overall hard drive pricing is expected to remain relatively stable, we expect gross margins to decline 2 to 3 percentage points from the fiscal second quarter through the fiscal fourth quarter due primarily to component cost inflation.\nWithin our Flash segment, we expect Flash revenue to decrease on a sequential basis in the fiscal third quarter driven by ASP. We expect Flash revenue to return to growth in the second half of calendar year 2022. Furthermore, we anticipate downward pressure on gross margins for the first half of this calendar year as cost reductions revert towards our long-term target of 15%.\nIn regard to our fiscal third quarter, our non-GAAP guidance is as follows. We expect revenue to be in the range of $4.45 billion to $4.65 billion with a sequential revenue decline for both Flash and hard drive businesses. We expect gross margin to be between 30% and 32%. We expect operating expenses to be between $750 million and $770 million. Interest and other expenses are expected to be approximately $70 million. Our tax rate is expected to be approximately 11% in the third quarter and for the fiscal year. We expect earnings per share to be between $1.50 and $1.80 in the third quarter, assuming approximately 318 million fully diluted shares outstanding.\nI'll now turn the call back over to Dave.\n\nDavid V. Goeckeler\n\nCEO & Director, Western Digital Corporation\n\nThanks, Bob. Looking ahead, we remain optimistic about our business outlook in calendar year 2022 as our customers continue to indicate strong end demand across cloud, client and consumer end markets. Despite the transitory issues we discussed earlier, it is clearer than ever that we have the right foundation for long-term growth and the right technology portfolio in place to ensure that we are successful in scaling our business.\nOver the last couple of years, we have made significant changes necessary to improve our focus, sharpen execution and set strategic goals to place Western Digital in a position of greater strength. And I'm excited that we are starting to see the fruits of those changes.\nBefore I finish today, I'd like to take a moment to comment on the CFO transition we announced earlier this afternoon. As you may have seen, we announced that Wissam Jabre will be joining Western Digital as Chief Financial Officer effective the week of February 7. Wissam was most recently Chief Financial Officer at Dialog Semiconductor. In addition to his deep financial and semiconductor expertise, Wissam also has technical expertise, and importantly, shares Western Digital's values of collaboration and innovation. You can read more about his background in the press release issued today.\nI'd like to extend my sincere thanks on behalf of the entire Board and management team to Bob for his dedication and hard work at the service of Western Digital. During my tenure as CEO, I've greatly benefited from his friendship and expertise. He's been an essential part of our leadership team, guiding key aspects of our strategy. Among many other contributions, Bob drove a capital allocation strategy that has led to significant repayment of our debt, marked this quarter by Western Digital's second investment-grade corporate rating. Bob's insight was also instrumental in helping us navigate COVID uncertainty and execute other strategic changes at the company to position us for growth and value creation.\nNext quarter, you'll have an opportunity to hear from Wissam. I know he's looking forward to it.\nWith that, Peter, let's begin the Q&A."

Welcome to the Western Digital Fiscal Second Quarter 2023 Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) And as a reminder, this call is being recorded.\nNow I will turn the call over to Mr. Peter Andrew. You may begin.\n\nT. Peter Andrew\n\nVP of IR, Western Digital Corporation\n\nThank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me today are David Goeckeler, Chief Executive Officer; and Wissam Jabre, Chief Financial Officer.\nBefore we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements, including expectations for our product portfolio, cost reductions, business plans and performance, demand and market trends and financial results based on management's current assumptions and expectations, and as such, does include risks and uncertainties.\nWe assume no obligation to update these statements. Please refer to our most recent financial report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC for more information on the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. We will also make references to non-GAAP financial measures today. Reconciliations between the non-GAAP and comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the press release and other materials that are being posted in the Investor Relations section of our website.\nWith that, I will now turn the call over to David for introductory remarks.\n\nDavid V. Goeckeler\n\nCEO & Director, Western Digital Corporation\n\nThank you, Peter. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining the call to discuss our 2023 second quarter results. The Western Digital team worked diligently within a dynamic market and delivered revenue at the high end of the guidance range we provided in October. We reported second quarter revenue of $3.1 billion and non-GAAP operating loss of $119 million. Our non-GAAP loss per share was $0.42.\nOur ongoing efforts to control expenses, optimize working capital and deploy capital judiciously helped us manage cash flow amidst a challenging flash pricing environment and larger-than-expected ACD underutilization that pressured gross margins.\nBefore we discuss the details of our second quarter results, I wanted to cover 2 other announcements that we are making today. First, we disclosed that Western Digital has entered into agreements with Apollo Global Management and Elliott Investment Management for convertible preferred equity investments totaling $900 million.\nIn connection with the agreement, Reed Rayman, a partner at Apollo, will join our Board starting immediately. On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to welcome Reed, a leading technology investor who will provide us with additional financial and strategic expertise, which will be critical as we continue to execute on our business strategy and complete our strategic review. Second, on January 25, we secured access to $875 million of financing through a delayed draw term loan.\nWhen combined with the actions we undertook to structurally lower our cost structure, these financings provide valuable financial optionality and flexibility to Western Digital as we continue our strategic review. Regardless of the outcome of the strategic review, our goal is to ensure the business is in a solid financial position to invest in innovation and create long-term shareholder value.\nGiven the ongoing nature and confidentiality of the process, we will not be answering any questions about the strategic review process or making comments on market rumors. We will provide updates as we have them. Over the past 3 years, we have worked continuously to reinvigorate innovation and bolster business agility for both our flash and HDD organizations, which enabled the Western Digital team to stay ahead of the market. Over the same period, we paid down $2.7 billion in debt and arranged for settlement of a long-standing tax dispute.\nSince the beginning of fiscal year 2023, we have taken additional actions to reset the business in response to the post-pandemic environment. These actions include: first, we have further reduced our capital expenditures across flash and HDD to moderate our supply. As a result, our projected cash capital expenditure for fiscal 2023 has declined nearly 40% from 6 months ago. Second, we have decreased supply bit growth across both flash and HDD. In flash, we reduced wafer starts by 30% in January.\nIn HDD, during the fiscal first quarter, we consolidated production lines across our manufacturing facilities and idled certain media production lines in Asia, reducing client hard drive capacity by approximately 40%. During the fiscal second quarter, we continued to optimize our capacity enterprise manufacturing footprint to align our supply with the new demand environment.\nThird, we have reduced our quarterly non-GAAP operating expense by over $100 million since the close of fiscal year 2022, driven by lower headcount, discretionary spending and variable compensation. We are targeting to reduce quarterly non-GAAP operating expense level to below $600 million by the time we exit the fiscal year. And lastly, in December, we successfully executed an amendment to the existing financial covenants under our credit agreement.\nTurning to end market demand during the fiscal second quarter. Demand for consumer-oriented products stabilized as we discussed in October. In consumer, we experienced a seasonal uptick across both flash and HDD. In client, channel demand for both SSD and HDD have improved. However, commercial PCs are now being impacted by tightening budgets and spending across corporations, which is negatively affecting client SSD shipments.\nIn cloud, we experienced a decline in nearline shipments as our customers were undergoing inventory digestion and ongoing subdued China demand.\nI'll now turn to business updates, starting with HDD. During the fiscal second quarter, our HDD revenue declined significantly as cloud inventory digestion intensified, while demand for retail and client HDD improved. We continue to successfully execute on our product road map as we completed qualifications and commenced shipments of our latest generation 22-terabyte CMR hard drives at multiple cloud and major OEM customers last quarter.\nWe are aggressively ramping this 22-terabyte CMR product this quarter and expect this drive along with its SMR variants to be our growth engine going forward. Qualifications of our 26-terabyte UltraSMR drives are also progressing well. Our major customers remain committed to adopting SMR drives as the 20% capacity gain that UltraSMR drives over CMR offers multi-generation TCO benefits to the most complex data centers worldwide.\nWe expect sequential growth in revenue and margin into our fiscal third quarter and continued recovery as we move through calendar year 2023. Turning to flash. Thanks to our broad portfolio, diverse routes to market and leading retail franchise combined with strong seasonal demand, bit shipments increased 20% sequentially, exceeding our forecast. While we continue to experience pricing pressure in the market, our premium brands, including SanDisk, SanDisk Professional and WD_BLACK continued to deliver strong share and profitability to support the business.\nOur premium WD_BLACK client SSD, which is optimized for gaming continues to be well received in the marketplace. It achieved a record exabyte shipments, unit shipments and average capacity per drive resulting in exabyte shipment increase of 73% sequentially and 41% year-over-year for this product.\nOn the technology front, BiCS5 represented 70% of our flash revenue in the December quarter, while BiCS6 will reach cost crossover in the fiscal third quarter. Our next-generation 3D NAND node BiCS8 has entered productization phase. BiCS8 incorporates several groundbreaking 3D NAND architectural innovations to deliver a major leap in performance and cost-effective solutions to a broad range of exciting products, demonstrating the benefits of Western Digital's strong partnership with Kioxia and our innovation leadership in 3D NAND architecture.\nAs we look into the fiscal third quarter, in hard drives, overall demand in cloud has stabilized, and we expect modest improvement in near line to offset a seasonal decline in client and consumer hard drives. We expect stronger improvements in the second half of this calendar year, led by the aggressive ramp of our 22 and 26 terabyte hard drives. In flash, we expect enterprise SSD product demand for the fiscal third quarter to be sharply reduced as certain large cloud customers have entered a digestion period.\nIn addition, a reduction in commercial PC demand is expected to impact client SSD shipments in the near term. Driven by the lower customer demand forecast in enterprise and client SSDs, we anticipate bit shipments to decline in the fiscal third quarter and return to growth in the fiscal fourth quarter. As I mentioned earlier, Western Digital lowered wafer starts in January, and we remain flexible in adjusting the magnitude and duration to restore our flash supply and demand balance.\nAs noted, for calendar year 2023, we expect reduced capital investment and lower utilization in response to the new demand environment. Our initial estimate is for flash demand bit growth to be in the low 20% range with production bit growth to be well below that of demand.\nWith that, let me turn the call over to Wissam, who will discuss our second quarter results in greater detail and provide an outlook for the third quarter.\n\nWissam G. Jabre\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Western Digital Corporation\n\nThank you, David, and good afternoon, everyone. Total revenue for the quarter was $3.1 billion, down 17% sequentially and 36% year-over-year. Non-GAAP loss per share was $0.42. Looking at our end markets, cloud represented 39% of revenue at $1.2 billion, down 33% sequentially and 36% year-over-year.\nSequentially, the declines in capacity enterprise drives sold to our cloud customers and smart videos were partly offset by an increase in flash shipments. Nearline bit shipments were 61 exabytes, down sequentially, driven by inventory digestion. The year-over-year decline was also primarily due to inventory digestion in hard drives. Client represented 35% of total revenue at $1.1 billion, down 11% sequentially and 41% year-over-year.\nSequentially, the decline was driven by pricing pressure across our flash products, which was partly offset by an increase in hard drive shipments. The year-over-year decline was also due to pricing pressure in flash as well as lower client SSD shipments for PC applications. Finally, consumer represented 26% of revenue at $0.8 billion, up 17% sequentially and down 25% year-over-year.\nSequentially, the increase was driven by a seasonal uptick in both retail hard drives and Flash shipments. The year-over-year decline was driven by lower retail hard drive shipments and pricing pressure in flash.\nTurning now to revenue by segment. We reported HDD revenue of $1.5 billion down 28% sequentially and 34% year-over-year. Sequentially, total HDD exabyte shipments decreased 35% and average price per hard drive decreased 21% to $99. On a year-over-year basis, total HDD exabyte shipments decreased 33%, and average price per unit increased 2%. Flash revenue was $1.7 billion, down 4% sequentially and 37% year-over-year. Sequentially, flash ASPs were down 20% on a blended basis and 13% on a like-for-like basis.\nFlash bit shipments increased 20% sequentially and remained approximately flat year-over-year. As we move to costs and expenses, please note that my comments will be related to non-GAAP results unless stated otherwise. Gross margin for the fiscal second quarter was 17.4%, down 9.3 percentage points sequentially and 16.2 percentage points year-over-year. Our HDD gross margin was 20.7%, down 7.8 percentage points sequentially and 9.9 percentage points year-over-year.\nOn both a sequential and year-over-year basis, the decline was due to underutilization related charges of approximately $100 million. Our flash gross margin was 14.5%, down 10 percentage points sequentially and 21.6 percentage points year-over-year. We are continuing to reduce our costs with operating expenses at $659 million for the quarter, down $30 million sequentially. Operating loss was $119 million. Taxes were a benefit of $48 million. Taxes are influenced by several factors, including the projected quarterly profitability for the rest of the year and our corporate tax structure.\nEarnings per share was a loss of $0.42. operating cash flow for the second quarter was $35 million, and free cash flow was an outflow of $240 million. Cash capital expenditure, which includes the purchase of property, plant and equipment and activity related to our Flash joint ventures on our cash flow statement was $275 million. Our gross debt outstanding remained at $7.1 billion at the end of the fiscal second quarter. Our trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA at the end of the second quarter, as defined in our credit agreement, was $3.3 billion, resulting in a gross leverage ratio of 2.1x compared to 1.5x a year ago.\nAs a reminder, our credit agreement includes $0.8 billion in depreciation add-back associated with the Flash Ventures. This is not reflected in our cash flow statement. Please refer to the earnings presentation on the Investor Relations website for further details.\nAs David mentioned, during the fiscal second quarter, we executed an amendment to the credit agreement that temporarily increased the covenant leverage ratio for the next 7 quarters. Our liquidity position continues to be strong.\nAt the end of the quarter, we had $1.9 billion of cash and cash equivalents and a revolver capacity of $2.25 billion for total liquidity of $4.1 billion. Today, we announced multiple agreements to further enhance our liquidity position by $1.8 billion as follows: On January 25, we closed the delayed draw term loan agreement with our lenders in the amount of $875 million. In addition, as David mentioned, Western Digital entered into an agreement with Apollo Global Management and Elliott Investment Management for a convertible preferred investment of $900 million. Together, these actions significantly increase our ability to access liquidity and provide additional financial flexibility and optionality as we manage through this challenging downturn and execute on our strategic review.\nBefore I go over guidance for the fiscal third quarter, I'll discuss the business outlook and the financial impact associated with the actions we are taking to rightsize our cost structure. In HDD, we expect revenue to increase modestly in the fiscal third quarter as growth in nearline shipments outpaces decline in consumer. In Flash, we expect both shipments and ASP to decrease sequentially. We expect bit growth to resume in the fiscal fourth quarter.\nFor the fiscal year 2023, we are reducing our gross capital expenditures to approximately $2.3 billion compared to our prior forecast of $3.2 billion entering this fiscal year. We are also aiming to reduce our cash capital expenditure to $900 million which is about 40% below our forecast 6 months ago.\nThe primary drivers of our lower capital expenditures are the delay of the BiCS6 transition in flash and reduced investment levels in both client and capacity enterprise hard drive manufacturing. We have reduced our quarterly operating expenses by over $100 million compared to 6 months ago. We are targeting to exit this fiscal year with quarterly operating expenses below $600 million. These actions will allow us to weather this cycle while also enabling us to continue advancing our innovative product road map going forward.\nI'll now turn to guidance. For the fiscal third quarter, our non-GAAP guidance is as follows: We expect revenue to be in the range of $2.6 billion to $2.8 billion. We expect gross margin to be between 9% and 11%, which includes underutilization charges in flash and HDD totaling $250 million, with flash driven by a 30% reduction in wafer starts.\nWe expect operating expenses to be between $600 million and $620 million. Interest and other expenses are expected to be approximately $90 million. We expect tax expenses to be between $60 million and $70 million for the fiscal third quarter and approximately $240 million to $260 million for the fiscal year. We expect loss per share of $1.70 to $1.40 in the third quarter, assuming approximately 319 million shares outstanding.\nI will now turn the call back over to David.\n\nDavid V. Goeckeler\n\nCEO & Director, Western Digital Corporation\n\nThanks, Wissam. Before we open up for questions, I wanted to reiterate our view of the long-term opportunities for both flash and HDD storage. Importantly, our efforts have enabled us to regain architectural leadership in both flash and HDD, and we are preparing these technologies to address the meaningful long-term growth for data storage from client to edge to cloud. With our diverse portfolio, broad go-to-market engine, an enviable retail franchise and a lower cost structure, we remain confident in our ability to deliver long-term shareholder value.\nOkay. Peter, let's open up for Q&A."

Welcome to Western Digital's Fiscal Third Quarter 2023 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Peter Andrew, Vice President, Financial Planning and Analysis of Investor Relations. You may begin.\n\nT. Peter Andrew\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me today are David Goeckeler, Chief Executive Officer; and Wissam Jabre, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements including expectations for our product portfolio, cost reductions, business plans and performance, demand and market trends and financial results based on management's current assumptions and expectations and as such, does include risks and uncertainties. We assume no obligation to update these statements. Please refer to our most recent financial report on Form 10-K and other filings with the SEC for more information on the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.\nWe will also make references to non-GAAP financial measures today. Reconciliations between the non-GAAP and comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the press release and other materials that are being posted in the Investor Relations section of our website.\nWith that, I will now turn the call over to David for introductory remarks.\n\nDavid V. Goeckeler\n\nCEO & Director, Western Digital Corporation\n\nThank you, Peter. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining the call to discuss our 2023 third quarter results. Western Digital's third quarter performance exceeded expectations with core metrics at the high end of our guidance range, demonstrating the company's resilience in a challenging market environment. We reported third quarter revenue of $2.8 billion, non-GAAP gross margin of 11% and a non-GAAP loss per share of $1.37. Over the last several years, our team is focused on enhancing business agility and delivering a range of innovative, industry-leading products that address the increasing data storage demands of our customers. The groundwork we laid combined with the actions we have taken since the beginning of this fiscal year to rightsize and refocus our business have enabled us to navigate a dynamic environment.\nI am pleased that we delivered non-GAAP gross margin at the higher end of our guidance range due to strong execution across both our HDD and flash businesses. In HDD, our early actions to streamline our manufacturing footprint and focus our product offerings on delivering the best value for our data center customers have resulted in gross margin upside and profitable market share gains in HDD. In flash, our broad go-to-market strategy anchored on our enviable retail franchise and a strong client SSD portfolio enabled us to optimize bit placement and bolster gross margin. During the fiscal third quarter, we saw signs of demand stabilizing across various end markets. In consumer, our Flash and HD results were consistent with the expectations we shared in January. In client, demand for each major product area came in better than we expected across PC OEM, channel, mobile and gaming. In cloud, demand for capacity enterprise hard drives improved, whereas the demand for flash drives was consistent with our expectations set in January.\nBefore I jump into updates on our HDD and flash businesses, I would like to reiterate that the strategic review process is ongoing, and we will provide updates as we have them.\nI'll now turn to the business update, starting with HDD. During the fiscal third quarter, our HDD revenue improved sequentially with growth in capacity enterprise offsetting seasonal declines in retail and client. During the quarter, our 22 terabyte CMR drive became the highest volume product among all of our 20-terabyte-and-above capacity points, demonstrating our leadership position at this capacity point. In addition, we expect to complete qualification of our 26 terabyte UltraSMR technology in the fiscal fourth quarter. These innovative products provide multi-generation benefits to our customers.\nTurning to flash. Total exabyte shipment came in higher than expected in consumer, mobile, PC OEM and channel products. Despite the industry experiencing the worst downturn in over a decade, Western Digital delivered positive product gross margin, excluding underutilization charges driven by our unique combination of premium retail brands, broad go-to-market channels and low-cost flash supply from our joint venture fab with Kioxia. Furthermore, we continue to see encouraging signs of price elasticity-driven content growth in retail flash led by WD_BLACK SSD optimized for gaming as well as mobile PC OEMs and channel within client. On the technology front, BiCS6 achieved its anticipated cost crossover during the quarter. Moreover, on March 30, Western Digital and Kioxia announced our next-generation BiCS8 node, a groundbreaking technology that builds upon the success of BiCS5 and BiCS6. This new technology is based on circuit bonded to array architecture which provides several benefits, including reduced cycle time, faster yield ramp, better lateral scaling and industry-leading I-O performance when compared to products based on circuit under array architecture. We continue to aggressively productize BiCS8 for a broad range of applications, which will position Western Digital for success as business conditions improve.\nAs we look to the fiscal fourth quarter, in hard drives, overall demand will be impacted by ongoing inventory digestion at cloud customers and a sustained decline in client. However, we are beginning to experience improved demand at certain customers in China. In flash, we are seeing signs of stabilization and content increase per unit. PC OEMs have emerged from inventory digestion and are now shipping closer to end demand. Gaming will remain strong, while enterprise SSD for cloud applications will remain soft. We anticipate modest growth in bit shipments into the fiscal fourth quarter.\nBefore I hand the call over to Wissam, I would like to thank the Western Digital team for the response efforts they made in addressing the network security incident we disclosed on April 2. Our team took proactive and precautionary measures to secure our operations and successfully executed on our business continuity plans.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Wissam.\n\nWissam G. Jabre\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Western Digital Corporation\n\nThank you, David, and good afternoon, everyone. Fiscal third quarter results reflected the challenging market environment with continued pressure on revenue and profitability. Total revenue for the quarter was $2.8 billion, down 10% sequentially and 36% year-over-year. Non-GAAP loss per share was $1.37. Looking at end markets, cloud represented 43% of total revenue at $1.2 billion, down 2% sequentially driven by an increase in capacity enterprise drive shipments which was offset by a decrease in flash shipments. Nearline bit shipments were 79 exabytes, up 31% sequentially. Year-over-year, revenue declined 32%, primarily due to a decline in shipments of both hard drive and flash products as well as price decreases in flash.\nClient represented 35% of total revenue at $1 billion, down 10% sequentially and 44% year-over-year. On both a sequential and year-over-year basis, the decrease was driven by price declines across our flash products and lower client SSD and hard drive shipments for PC application. Finally, consumer represented 22% of total revenue at $0.6 billion, down 22% sequentially and 29% year-over-year. Sequentially, the decrease was due to a seasonal decline in shipments of both retail hard drive and flash products as well as price declines in retail flash. The year-over-year decrease was driven by lower retail hard drive shipments and price declines in flash.\nTurning now to revenue by segment. HDD revenue was $1.5 billion, up 3% sequentially and down 30% year-over-year. Sequentially, total HDD exabyte shipments increased 15% and average price per hard drive increased 10% to $109. On a year-over-year basis, total HDD exabyte shipments decreased 23%, and average price per unit increased 9%. Flash revenue was $1.3 billion, down 21% sequentially and 42% year-over-year. Sequentially, flash ASPs were down 10% on a blended basis and 12% on a like-for-like basis. Flash bit shipments decreased 14% sequentially and 1% year-over-year.\nMoving to costs and expenses. Please note that my comments will be related to non-GAAP results unless stated otherwise. Gross margin for the fiscal third quarter was 10.6%, down 6.8 percentage points sequentially and 21.1 percentage points year-over-year. This includes $275 million of charges for manufacturing underutilization, inventory write-downs and other items. HDD gross margin was higher than anticipated at 24.3%, up 3.6 percentage points sequentially and down 3.4 percentage points year-over-year. Sequentially, the increase was primarily due to higher capacity enterprise volume as well as lower manufacturing costs and underutilization related charges. Underutilization charges were less than projected at approximately $40 million or 2.7 percentage points, partially benefiting from the actions to streamline our manufacturing footprint and offsetting other charges of $22 million.\nFlash gross margin was negative 5%, down 19.5 percentage points sequentially and [ 40.6 ] percentage points year-over-year. Underutilization charges associated with the reduced manufacturing volumes were approximately $160 million or 12.2 percentage points, less than expected as we focused on lowering manufacturing costs. During the quarter, we incurred $53 million of flash inventory write-down charges resulting from projected selling prices falling below the cost of inventory. We continue to tightly manage our operating expenses, which were at $602 million for the quarter, down $57 million sequentially and $138 million year-over-year.\nOperating loss in the quarter was $304 million driven by underutilization charges inventory write-downs and other items totaling $275 million. Income tax expense was $60 million. Despite the consolidated loss, we continue to have taxable income in certain geographies resulting in taxes payable in those areas. Fiscal third quarter loss per share was $1.37, inclusive of a $9 million dividend cost associated with the convertible preferred equity.\nOperating cash flow for the third quarter was an outflow of $381 million, and free cash flow was an outflow of $527 million. Cash capital expenditures, which include the purchase of property, plant and equipment, and activity related to our flash joint ventures on the cash flow statement was $146 million. Gross debt outstanding was $7.1 billion at the end of the fiscal third quarter. Trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA at the end of the third quarter, as defined in our credit agreement was $2.5 billion, resulting in a gross leverage ratio of 2.8x compared to 2.1x in the fiscal second quarter. As a reminder, our credit agreement includes $0.7 billion in depreciation add-back associated with the flash joint ventures. This is not reflected in our cash flow statement. Please refer to the earnings presentation on the Investor Relations website for further details. At the end of the quarter, total liquidity was $5.3 billion, including cash and cash equivalents of $2.2 billion, undrawn revolver capacity of $2.25 billion and unused delayed drawn term loan facility of $875 million.\nBefore I cover guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter, I'll discuss the business outlook. We expect HDD revenue to decrease sequentially due to ongoing inventory digestion at cloud customers. We expect flash revenue to decrease sequentially as modest growth in bit shipments is more than offset by ASP declines. We expect flash bit shipment growth to accelerate in the first half of fiscal year 2024. In the fiscal fourth quarter, total gross margin will be negatively impacted by underutilization charges and flash pricing. We continue to tightly manage our cost structure through this dynamic environment and expect operating expenses to be below $600 million.\nFor fiscal year 2023, we project gross capital expenditures to be approximately $2.2 billion and cash capital expenditures to be approximately $0.8 billion. The projected cash capital expenditures represent more than a 50% reduction from our forecast as we entered fiscal year 2023 and approximately 35% reduction from fiscal year 2022.\nI'll now turn to guidance. For the fiscal fourth quarter, our non-GAAP guidance is as follows. We expect revenue to be in the range of $2.4 billion to $2.6 billion. We expect gross margin to be between 3% and 5% which includes underutilization charges across flash and HDD totaling $220 million to $240 million. We expect operating expenses to be between $580 million to $600 million. Interest and other expenses are expected to be approximately $90 million. We expect income tax expense to be between $60 million and $70 million. We expect loss per share of $2.20 to $1.90, assuming approximately 321 million shares outstanding.\nI'll now turn the call back over to David.\n\nDavid V. Goeckeler\n\nCEO & Director, Western Digital Corporation\n\nThanks, Wissam. Over the past few quarters, we have successfully ramped a series of industry-leading storage products and commercialized innovative technologies while concurrently rightsizing our cost structure. Our proactive actions have positioned Western Digital favorably for the future as demand gradually returns to normal levels.\nIn closing, I would like to thank our team members for their unwavering commitment in advancing innovative products and driving operational efficiency. Their exceptional efforts have allowed Western Digital to deliver industry-leading gross margins across our HDD and flash businesses despite the challenging and rapidly changing landscape. Additionally, I am immensely proud to share that Western Digital has been honored for the fifth consecutive year as one of the world's most ethical companies by the [ Ethisphere Institute ]. This recognition is a testament to the dedication and support of our people worldwide, and we remain committed to upholding the highest ethical standards in all that we do.\nOkay. I look forward to your questions. Let's open it up."

Welcome to Western Digital's Third Quarter Fiscal 2024 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this event is being recorded.\nNow I will turn the call over to Mr. Peter Andrew, Vice President Financial Planning and Analysis and Investor Relations. You may begin.\n\nT. Peter Andrew\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me today are David Goeckeler, Chief Executive Officer; and Wissam Jabre, Chief Financial Officer.\nBefore we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon management's current assumptions and expectations, and as such, does include risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements include expectations for our product portfolio, our business plan and performance, the separation of our Flash and HDD businesses, ongoing market trends and our future financial results. We assume no obligation to update these statements. Please refer to our most recent financial report on Form 10-K and our other filings with the SEC for more information on the risks and uncertainties and that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations.

Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the call to discuss our third quarter of fiscal year 2024 performance.\nWestern Digital delivered excellent results in the quarter with revenue of $3.5 billion non-GAAP gross margin of 29.3% and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.63, all of which exceeded expectations. Our strategy of developing a diversified portfolio of industry-leading products across a broad range of end markets, coupled with structural changes we have made to both of our businesses is unlocking our true earnings potential and allowing us to continue improving through-cycle profitability and dampening business cycles. This strategy enables us to generate higher earnings per share even in a constrained supply environment. In addition, our commitment to achieving operational efficiency and enhancing our agility has allowed us to run our Flash and HDD businesses more efficiently and further drive innovation to take opportunities. In particular, as the technology landscape continues to evolve, the demand for AI solutions is becoming increasingly apparent across our end markets. The uptick in AI adoption is highlighting the incredible value of data and will drive increased storage demand across both HDD and Flash at the edge and in the core, providing greater long-term growth and margin expansion opportunities for Western Digital. We are in the early innings of unlocking the full potential of this company, and our team remains focused on improving the profitability of our business to drive long-term margin expansion and shareholder value as these new demand opportunities present themselves.\nBefore I dive further into the demand environment, I want to briefly comment on the status of the separation of our Flash and HDD businesses. I am proud of the team's ongoing efforts as we drive towards completion of the separation in the second half of the calendar year. We remain focused on achieving the separation as soon as possible, and we'll continue to provide further updates on our progress as appropriate.\nMoving on to end market commentary. I am pleased to report that during the quarter, revenue in all of our major end markets returned to year-over-year growth. In cloud, we experienced 29% growth in revenue from a year ago, highlighting the incredible success of our industry-leading HDD product line. In addition, we began to experience an increase in demand for our flash-based solutions, signaling a long-awaited recovery in this end market.\nIn client, 20% revenue growth from a year ago was driven by increased bit demand for our flash-based solutions, coupled with an increase in ASPs.\nIn consumer, we experienced 17% revenue growth from a year ago, highlighting the power of the SanDisk premium brand. Higher flash bit sales, combined with a better pricing environment more than offset the continued decline in consumer HDD demand.\nI'll now turn to business updates, starting with flash. Our sequential revenue growth in the quarter reflects the continuing commitment to disciplined capital spending and carefully optimizing bit shipments into our most profitable end markets to take advantage of the improved pricing environment. This approach, combined with the strength of our product portfolio has enabled us to drive significantly higher profitability while strategically managing our inventory. On the technology front, we achieved a significant milestone by initiating mass production of our QLC-based client SSD, leveraging BiCS6 technology. This is yet another significant milestone demonstrating our continued commitment to innovation and market leadership. These advancements pave the way to spearhead the market's transition to QLC-based flash solutions in calendar year 2024. Additionally, our progress with BiCS8 is on track. While this technology is ready to be productized as market conditions warrant, our innovative offerings will remain at the forefront of the market, further strengthening our competitive position and bolstering our growth prospects. As noted earlier, in the third quarter, we began to experience an increase in demand for our enterprise SSD solutions. We are seeing demand returning for NVMe SSDs that we qualified before the downturn. We are also experiencing significant interest in providing these products in dramatically higher capacities for AI-related applications which we expect to ship in the second half of the year.\nIn addition, we are also sampling our newest high-performance PCI Gen 5, BiCS6-based enterprise SSD. We are preparing for qualification at a hyperscaler and the product is generating significant interest in the enterprise market. We expect to ramp in the second half of the calendar year.\nTurning to HDD. The sequential revenue increase was driven by improved nearline demand and higher pricing as we focused on optimizing profitability per exabyte sold. In particular, nearline revenue reached a fixed quarter high, reflecting the successful strategy we put in place to bring the most innovative, high-capacity and high-performance drives to market. We have the right products at the right cost structure, which are reflected in our financial performance.\nOur cloud customers continue to transition to SMR with our 26-terabyte and 28-terabyte Ultra SMR drives, quickly becoming a significant portion of our capacity enterprise exabyte shipments. SMR-based drives represented approximately 50% of nearline exabyte shipments in the quarter.\nOur portfolio strategy to commercialize ePMR, OPD NAND and Ultra SMR technologies in advance of our transition to HAMR, has proven to be the winning strategy and enables us to deliver to customers the industry's highest capacity and leading TCO drives, all of which can be produced at scale with controlled costs. We are confident that our product strategy, which combines Ultra SMR technology with upcoming advancements in nearline drives is enabling Western Digital to deliver best-in-class gross margin in HDDs all at a time when AI is emerging as another growth engine for the industry.\nAs we move toward a new supply and demand environment, characterized by higher demand, supply tightness and product shortages, we are leveraging our proven technology we've already introduced to the market to meet the demands of our customers with the right portfolio at the right time, while also operating with a lean cost structure for continued profitability improvement in our HDD business.\nAlthough the actions we are taking have improved profitability, we remain focused on driving higher margins to appropriately value the incredible amount of innovation and TCO improvements we continue to deliver to our customers.\nBefore I turn it over to Wissam, I wanted to share some perspectives on our outlook. Within Flash, in addition to growth opportunities at the edge, which is Western Digital strength, we are encouraged by the returning demand within the enterprise SSD market and expect growth throughout this calendar year. AI-related workloads are driving increasing demand for enterprise SSDs, and our portfolio is well positioned to support those use cases.\nLooking ahead, we anticipate bit shipments to remain flat into the fiscal fourth quarter and look to flash ASP increases to be the primary revenue growth driver led by our focus on allocating bits to the most high-value end markets amidst the tightening supply environment. While we're pleased to see pricing trends moving in a positive direction, it's crucial to acknowledge the importance of maintaining capital discipline and only reinvesting capital back into the business once profitability improves further, and we see sustained demand. Overall, our continued focus on improving profitability through our innovation road map, disciplined capital spending and strategic pricing initiatives position us well for continued success in calendar year 2024 and into 2025 by offering the most capital and cost-efficient bits in the industry.\nIn HDD, the success of our portfolio of leading capacity enterprise products, combined with the restructuring efforts we've implemented in recent years are yielding improved unit economics and greater visibility. As cloud demand is recovering, we anticipate continued growth driven by higher nearline demand and better pricing as we are now in a supply-constrained environment. We're optimistic about aligning the pricing of our products to better mirror the innovation we are integrating into them, supporting long-term margin expansion in our HDD business. As we reap the rewards of the innovation and operational efficiencies that we've implemented, we will look for opportunities to reinvest in the business when the conditions are ripe for expansion. We will approach every capital allocation decision with a focus on discipline.\nLet me now turn the call over to Wissam, who will discuss our financial third quarter results.\n\nWissam G. Jabre\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Western Digital Corporation\n\nThank you, and good afternoon, everyone.\nFollowing on David's comments, Western Digital return to profitability and free cash flow generation and delivered great results in the quarter, which exceeded expectations. Total revenue for the quarter was $3.5 billion, up 14% sequentially and 23% year-over-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.63.\nLooking at end markets, cloud represented 45% of total revenue at $1.6 billion, up 45% sequentially and 29% year-over-year. The growth was primarily attributed to higher nearline shipments and improved nearline per unit pricing with Flash revenue up both sequentially and year-over-year. Nearline bit shipments of 108 exabytes were up 60% sequentially.\nClient represented 34% of total revenue at $1.2 billion, up 5% sequentially and 20% year-over-year. Sequentially, the increase in Flash ASP more than offset a decline in Flash bit shipments, while HDD revenue decreased. Year-over-year, the increase was driven by growth in both Flash and HDD ASPs and Flash bit shipments.\nConsumer represented 21% of total revenue at $0.7 billion, down 13% sequentially and up 7% year-over-year. Sequentially, both Flash and HDD were down at approximately similar rates and in line with seasonality. On a year-over-year basis, the increase was driven by growth in flash bit shipments and ASP.\nTurning now to revenue by business segment for the fiscal third quarter. Flash revenue was $1.7 billion, up 2% sequentially as ASP increased 18% on both blended and like-for-like basis. Bit shipments decreased 15% from last quarter as we proactively focused our flash bit placement to maximize profitability. Flash revenue grew 30% from fiscal third quarter of 2023 on higher bits and ASP.\nACD revenue was $1.8 billion, up 28% from last quarter, as exabyte shipments increased 41% and average price per unit increased 19% to $145. Compared to the fiscal third quarter of 2023, HDD revenue grew 17%, while total exabyte shipments and average price per unit were up 25% and 33%, respectively.\nMoving to gross margin and expenses. Please note, my comments will be related to non-GAAP results unless stated otherwise. Gross margin was 29.3%, well above the guidance range. Gross margin improved 13.8 percentage points sequentially and 18.7 percentage points year-on-year due to better pricing, our continued focus on cost reduction, and lower underutilization charges. Flash gross margin was higher than expected at 27.4%, up 19.5 percentage points sequentially and points year-over-year. There were no underutilization charges in the quarter. HDD gross margin was 31.1%, up 6.3 percentage points sequentially and 6.8 percentage points year-over-year. This includes underutilization charges of $17 million or 1 percentage point headwind. HDD gross margin is within our long-term target range, including underutilization charges. This underscores the team's focus on cost reduction and profitability as previously, this level of gross margin was achieved with higher revenue.\nOperating expenses were $632 million for the quarter, up 13% sequentially and 5% year-over-year. The sequential increase was mainly driven by higher variable compensation associated with better-than-expected financial results.\nOperating income was $380 million, which included HDD underutilization charges of $17 million. Tax expenses in the quarter was $51 million, reflecting the improved financial outlook for the fiscal year. Fiscal third quarter earnings per share was $0.63.\nOperating cash flow was $58 million, and free cash flow was $91 million. Cash capital expenditures, which include the purchase of property, plant and equipment and activity related to Flash joint ventures on the cash flow statement represented a cash inflow of $33 million. Third quarter inventory was flat from the prior quarter at $3.2 billion, with days of inventory increasing 4 days to 119 days. A decline in HDD inventory offset an increase in Flash inventory. Gross debt outstanding was $7.8 billion at the end of the fiscal third quarter. Cash and cash equivalents were $1.9 billion, and total liquidity was $4.1 billion, including revolver capacity of $2.2 billion.\nFor the fiscal fourth quarter, our non-GAAP guidance is as follows. We expect revenue to be in the range of $3.6 billion to $3.8 billion and project sequential revenue growth in both HDD and Flash.\nIn HDD, we expect continued momentum with our industry-leading SMR product portfolio aimed at the cloud. In Flash, we anticipate bits will be flat and ASP is up as we continue optimizing our bit placement to maximize profitability. Gross margin is expected to be between 32% and 34%. We expect operating expenses to be between $670 million and $690 million with the increase mainly related to certain project-driven investments, coupled with higher variable compensation as the financial outlook has continued to strengthen. Interest and other expenses are expected to be approximately $105 million. We expect income tax expense to be between $30 million and $40 million for the fiscal fourth quarter and $130 million to $140 million for fiscal year 2024 as the financial outlook improved. We expect earnings per share to be $1.05, plus or minus $0.15, based on approximately 342 million shares outstanding. The financial outlook has strengthened, and we will remain disciplined in executing the business, controlling our capital spending and improving our profitability.\nI will now turn the call back over to David.\n\nDavid Goeckeler\n\nExecutive Vice President and General Manager -Networking & Security Business, Cisco Systems, Inc.\n\nThanks, Wissam.\nLet me wrap up, and then we'll open up for questions. I'm pleased with the team's performance in developing a diversified portfolio of industry-leading products across a broad range of end markets. As industry supply and demand dynamics continue to improve, we will remain disciplined around our capital spending and focused on driving innovation and efficiency across our business. coupled with the structural changes we have made to our businesses, we are confident in our ability to drive greater through-cycle profitability and dampen business cycles. As we move forward, we remain uniquely positioned to capitalize on the promising growth prospects that lie ahead, solidifying our leadership position in the industry, particularly as AI continues to drive new storage solution opportunities and growth.\nOkay. Peter, let's start the Q&A."

Reconciliations between the non-GAAP and comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the press release and other materials that are being posted in the Investor Relations section of our website.\nWith that, I'll now turn the call over to David for introductory remarks.\n\nDavid V. Goeckeler\n\nCEO & Director, Western Digital Corporation\n\nThank you, Peter. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining the call to discuss our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2023 results. Western Digital's fiscal fourth quarter revenue exceeded expectations as our access to broad go-to-market channels, enviable retail franchise and strong client SSD portfolio enabled us to capture demand upsides in both client and consumer end markets, reaffirming our strength in a challenging market environment. We reported fourth quarter revenue of $2.7 billion and non-GAAP gross margin of 3.9%. And non-GAAP loss per share was $1.98.\nBefore diving into the specifics of the quarter and the full fiscal year, I would like to take a moment to reflect on our accomplishments in fiscal year 2023. Importantly, we continue to optimize our operations and successfully executed our innovative product road map, priming ourselves for greater profitability when demand rebounds across hard drives and flash. Throughout the fiscal year, we were focused on enhancing our product leadership and reinforcing our business agility.\nIn HDD, we have successfully qualified our latest family of capacity enterprise hard drives that all major customers and are shipping our 26 terabyte UltraSMR drive in high volume. In Flash, we pioneered the use of wafer bonding in advanced 3D NAND manufacturing and introduced the groundbreaking technology in BiCS8, which sets the foundation for future 3D NAND scaling. On the expense front, we streamlined investments across our HDD and Flash portfolio which enabled us to significantly reduce quarterly operating expense while continuing to deliver innovative products and technologies to address customers' growing storage needs.\nFurther, we reduced our cash capital expenditure run rate by over 50% in the fiscal second half and consolidated our hard drive manufacturing footprint. These efforts enabled Western Digital to preserve capital while effectively executing on product strategies and aligning our supply with post-pandemic demand environment.\nNotably, we reduced our inventory by nearly $300 million sequentially and exited fiscal year 2023 at a much healthier level than a few quarters ago. And in June, we successfully completed amendments to our credit agreements, which provide Western Digital with significant additional financial flexibility as we navigate macro dynamics.\nIn summary, we continue to proactively take action to bolster our agility enhance our liquidity position, optimize our inventory levels across HDD and Flash and strengthened our position as an industry and market leader. We exited fiscal year 2023 well positioned to capitalize on improving market conditions and capture long-term growth opportunities in data storage, spanning from client to edge to cloud. Finally, I want to acknowledge that the strategic review is ongoing. We continue to make progress on this process and will provide updates as appropriate.\nTurning to the fiscal fourth quarter. revenue in both client and consumer end markets returned to sequential growth, led by normalized end market demand and higher average capacity per unit in Flash. In Consumer, Retail Flash exceeded our expectations across all major product categories. We saw similar results in client with upside in both HDD and flash and across almost all major product categories, including client SSD, gaming console, embedded flash and client hard drives. In cloud, demand for both hard drive and flash products remain subdued.\nI'll now turn to business updates, starting with HDD. In the fiscal fourth quarter, ongoing cloud weakness drove the overall decline in HDD revenue. However, demand for both client and consumer hard drives has stabilized and exceeded our expectations. At the end of the fiscal fourth quarter, we have successfully qualified all variants of our 22 terabyte CMR and 26 terabyte UltraSMR hard drive platforms at all major cloud customers, setting the stage to improve shipments and profitability.\nIn addition, we are about to begin product sampling of our 28-terabyte UltraSMR drive. This cutting-edge product is built upon the success of our ePMR and UltraSMR technologies, with features and reliability trusted by our customers worldwide. We are staging this product for quick qualification and ramp as demand improves.\nTurning to Flash. Revenue increased sequentially led by growth in both client and consumer flash bit shipments, which exceeded our expectations with total bit shipments returning to year-over-year growth. The stronger-than-expected bit growth is attributable to normalizing PC and consumer demand as well as content growth. Average capacity per consumer and client SSD increased over 40% and 20% year-over-year, respectively.\nMoving to technology developments. We continue to aggressively productize BiCS8 based on a chip bonded to array architecture. BiCS8 solidifies Western Digital and Kok's leadership in cost, capital efficiency and I/O performance into the future.\nBefore I turn it over to Wissam, I wanted to share some perspective on our outlook. In HDD, as we look to the fiscal first quarter, we expect overall demand to remain stable. Beyond the fiscal first quarter, we anticipate both improving demand and new product ramps to drive growth in revenue and profitability. In Flash, we are encouraged by several indicators signaling improving market dynamics. Notably, our 2 largest end markets, client and consumer are returning to growth, inventories are normalizing, content per unit is increasing and price declines have been moderating.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Wissam.\n\nWissam G. Jabre\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Western Digital Corporation\n\nThanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. As David mentioned, fiscal fourth quarter revenue exceeded our expectations. Total revenue for the quarter was $2.7 billion, down 5% sequentially and 41% year-over-year. Non-GAAP loss per share was $1.98.\nLooking at end markets for the fiscal fourth quarter, cloud represented 37% of total revenue at $1 billion, down 18% sequentially and 53% year-over-year. Sequentially, the decline was primarily due to a decrease in capacity enterprise drive shipments. Nearline bit shipments were 59 exabytes, down 26% sequentially, driven by ongoing weakness at cloud customers. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to declines in both hard drive and flash product shipments.\nClient represented 39% of total revenue at $1 billion, up 6% sequentially and down 37% year-over-year. Sequentially, the increase was driven by growth in bit shipments for gaming consoles. The year-over-year decrease was due to declines in Flash pricing and lower client SSD and hard drive unit shipments for PC applications.\nConsumer represented 24% of total revenue at $0.6 billion, up 3% sequentially and down 19% year-over-year. Sequentially, the increase was primarily due to higher retail SSD shipments. The year-over-year decrease was driven by price declines in Flash and lower retail Hard Drive shipments. For the fiscal year, revenue was $12.3 billion, down 34% from fiscal 2022. Non-GAAP gross margin declined 17.2 percentage points to 15.7%, and non-GAAP operating margin decreased 21.8 percentage points to negative 4.8%. Non-GAAP loss per share was $3.59.\nLooking at end markets for fiscal year 2023, cloud revenue decreased 34% year-over-year primarily due to reduced shipments of capacity enterprise hard drives and enterprise SSDs. Client revenue decreased 39% year-over-year, primarily due to declines in Flash pricing as well as lower client SSD and hard drive unit shipments for PC applications. Lastly, Consumer revenue decreased 26% for the year as growth in retail SSD bit shipments was more than offset by broad-based Flash price decline and lower consumer Hard Drive shipments.\nTurning now to revenue by segment. In the fiscal fourth quarter, HDD revenue was $1.3 billion, down 13% sequentially and 39% year-over-year. Sequentially, total HDD exabyte shipments decreased 18% and average price per unit decreased 9% to $99. On a year-over-year basis, HDD exabyte shipments decreased 38% and average price per unit decreased 17%.\nFlash revenue was $1.4 billion, up 5% sequentially and down 43% year-over-year. Sequentially, Flash ASPs decreased 6% on a blended basis and 9% on a like-for-like basis. Flash bit shipments increased 15% sequentially and 7% year-over-year.\nMoving to costs and expenses. Please note that my comments will be related to non-GAAP results unless stated otherwise. Gross margin for the fiscal fourth quarter was 3.9%, down 6.7 percentage points sequentially and 28.4 percentage points year-over-year. This includes $272 million in costs or 10.2 percentage points for manufacturing underutilization, Flash inventory write-downs and other items.\nHDD gross margin was 20.7%, down 3.6 percentage points sequentially and 7.5 percentage points year-over-year. Sequentially, the decrease was primarily due to lower capacity enterprise volume as well as higher underutilization related charges. Underutilization charges were $76 million or 5.9 percentage points.\nFlash gross margin was negative 11.9%, down 6.9 percentage points sequentially and 47.8 percentage points year-over-year. Underutilization charges due to the reduced manufacturing volumes were $135 million, and inventory write-downs were $27 million, resulting in an 11.8 percentage point reduction. We continue to tightly manage our operating expenses of $582 million for the quarter, down $20 million sequentially and $178 million year-over-year.\nOperating loss in the quarter was $478 million, driven mainly by underutilization charges, inventory write-downs and other items totaling $272 million. Income tax expense was $57 million for fiscal fourth quarter and $237 million for fiscal year 2023. Despite the consolidated loss, we continue to have taxable income in certain geographies, resulting in taxes payable in those areas. Fiscal fourth quarter loss per share was $1.98, inclusive of $15 million dividend associated with the convertible preferred equity.\nOperating cash flow for the fourth quarter was an outflow of $68 million and free cash flow was an outflow of $219 million. Cash capital expenditures which include the purchase of property, plant and equipment and activity related to our Flash joint ventures on the cash flow statement were $151 million. Gross debt outstanding was $7.1 billion at the end of fiscal fourth quarter.\nTrailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA at the end of the fourth quarter, as defined in our credit agreement, was $1.6 billion, resulting in a gross leverage ratio of 4.5x compared to 2.8x in the fiscal third quarter. As a reminder, the credit agreement includes 0.7 billion in depreciation add-back associated with the Flash joint ventures. This is not reflected in the cash flow statement. Please refer to the earnings presentation on the Investor Relations website for further details.\nDuring the fiscal fourth quarter, we executed amendment to our credit agreements. These amendments include modifications to the leverage ratio requirements applicable through the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025, which provide additional financial flexibility in the near term. We also extended the commitment under the delayed draw term loan agreement to August 14, 2023. Please refer to our earnings presentation for details.\nAt the end of the quarter, total liquidity was $4.9 billion, including cash and cash equivalents of $2 billion, undrawn revolver capacity of $2.25 billion and an unused delayed draw term loan facility of $600 million.\nBefore I cover guidance for the fiscal first quarter, I'll discuss our business outlook. For fiscal first quarter, sequentially, we expect both HDD and Flash revenue to be relatively stable. In fiscal first quarter, we are continuing to adjust production to better match demand and anticipate underutilization charges to impact both HDD and Flash gross margins along with product mix pressures on flash ASP.\nBeyond the fiscal first quarter, we anticipate both HDD and Flash revenue to improve through the remainder of fiscal year 2024, driven by normalizing demand in storage as well as higher average content per unit in Flash. Gross margin is expected to gradually improve, driven by higher HDD volume and lower underutilization charges in both Flash and HDD. We will continue to tightly manage our cost structure and expenses as we navigate the challenging environment. For fiscal year 2024, we expect capital expenditures to decline significantly.\nI'll now turn to guidance. For the fiscal first quarter, our non-GAAP guidance is as follows: we expect revenue to be in the range of $2.55 billion to $2.75 billion. We expect gross margin to be between 2.5% and 4.5%, which includes underutilization charges across Flash and HDD totaling $200 million to $220 million. We expect operating expenses to be between $570 million to $590 million.\nInterest and other expenses are expected to be approximately $90 million. We expect income tax expense to be between $30 million and $40 million for the fiscal first quarter and $130 million to $170 million for fiscal year 2024. We expect the loss per share of $1.80 to $2.10, assuming approximately 323 million shares outstanding.\nI will now turn the call back over to David.\n\nDavid V. Goeckeler\n\nCEO & Director, Western Digital Corporation\n\nThanks, Wissam. Let me just wrap up. Fiscal year 2023 marked a period of exceptional progress in strategic planning for Western Digital. We diligently optimize our operations and executed our innovative product road map, priming ourselves for greater profitability as demand inevitably rebounds across Hard Drives and Flash. As we move forward, we remain confident in our ability to capitalize on emerging opportunities and deliver continued success.\nBefore opening up for Q&A, I would like to take a moment to recognize Siva Sivaram, our esteemed President of Technology and Strategy. Siva will be leaving Western Digital to pursue a great leadership opportunity in a different technology domain. Siva has made significant contributions to Western Digital and SanDisk over the past 10 years, and he's a wonderful friend. We wish him all the best going forward. Peter, let's start the Q&A."

[Operator Instructions] Please also note, today's event is being recorded.\nAt this time, I'd like to turn the floor over to Peter Andrews, VP of FP&A and Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead.\n\nT. Peter Andrew\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. Joining me today are David Goeckeler, Chief Executive Officer; and Wissam Jabre, Chief Financial Officer. Before I begin, we have a lot of exciting items to discuss today. In addition to the earnings press release and slides, we also have a press release and slides regarding the conclusion of our strategic review. All of these materials will be posted in the Investor Relations section of our website shortly.\nLet me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on management's current assumptions and expectations and, as such, does include risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements include expectations for our product portfolio, spending and cost reductions, business plans and performance, market trends, financial results, the outcome of a potential separation of our HDD and flash businesses including the form, timing and tax-free status of the transaction, our ability to complete the transaction, the future performance of our separated businesses and the creation of shareholder value by separating our businesses.\nWe assume no obligation to update these statements. Please refer to our most recent financial report on Form 10-K and other filings with the SEC for more information on the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.\nWe will also make references to non-GAAP financial measures today. Reconciliations between the non-GAAP and comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the press release and other materials that are being posted in the Investor Relations section of our website.\nWith that, I will now turn the call over to David for introductory remarks.\n\nDavid V. Goeckeler\n\nCEO & Director, Western Digital Corporation\n\nThank you, Peter. Good morning, and thank you for joining our call. I will first discuss the completion of the strategic review and then turn to our first quarter results.\nWe're thrilled to announce the completion of our strategic review and plans to form 2 independent public companies focused on capitalizing on the data storage industry's growth in HDD and flash. After evaluating a comprehensive range of alternatives, the Western Digital management team and Board determined that spinning off its flash business is the best executable alternative at this time to fully realize value for shareholders.\nThis transaction will allow each franchise to execute on its product and innovation road map and capitalize on the unique growth opportunities in their respective end markets. Each company will benefit from streamline management focus, operational flexibility and the ability to set its own distinct capital allocation and shareholder return policies. We are excited for the opportunities this transaction creates to better serve our customers, support our suppliers, partners and employees and unlock significant value for our shareholders.\nBefore discussing the details, let me walk you through the journey that brought us to this point. In March 2020, I joined Western Digital with a strong conviction in the company's unique position to accelerate and benefit from the digital transformation that is reshaping every industry, every company and how all of us live our daily lives. And importantly, I saw an opportunity to create value for a leader in both NAND flash and hard drives.\nDuring my early days of the company, I spent considerable energy into rebuilding and refocusing the company, including the formation of the HDD and flash business units. It soon became clear that our focus on driving 2 distinct technology portfolios was the right strategy, and the new management team that I brought in worked together to transform Western Digital by bolstering business agility and reinvigorating innovation.\nIn addition, we promptly focused on strengthening our balance sheet. We made the tough decision to suspend our dividend, which allowed Western Digital to speed up debt reduction and pay down $2.7 billion of debt over a couple of years following the suspension. We further enhanced our liquidity by bringing in $900 million of strategic investment from Apollo Global Management and Elliott Investment Management and amended our credit agreements. We also settled a long-standing tax dispute to increase strategic optionality.\nThe groundwork we laid over the past several years, including the additional actions taken in fiscal year '23 to rightsize the business, have enabled us to navigate a dynamic environment, all while staying focused on delivering a range of industry-leading products. Each business is now in a strong operational position to succeed on its own, and the actions we are announcing today will further enable each company to drive long-term success in the years to come.\nThe Western Digital Board completed the strategic review after evaluating a comprehensive range of alternatives and determined that spinning off its flash business is the best executable alternative at this time to fully realize value for shareholders. During our strategic review process, we evaluated material opportunities for each of our businesses. However, given current constraints, it has become clearer to the Board in recent weeks that delivering a stand-alone separation is the right next step in the evolution of Western Digital and puts the company in the best position to unlock value for our shareholders while providing strategic optionality for both businesses.\nGiven the confidential nature of the strategic review, we will not be discussing any of the other alternatives that were considered during the process. On Page 6 of the presentation, we present a separation transaction summary. The HDD business will retain the Western Digital name and become an independent publicly traded company. The flash business is expected to be spun off in a tax-free transaction to Western Digital shareholders, and the name of the publicly traded company will be determined at a later time. We target to complete these plans in the second half of calendar year '24, subject to the principal closing conditions described in the slide.\nPage 7 provides a bit more visibility into some of the end market exposure for our flash and HDD businesses on a trailing 12-month basis.\nMoving to the individual businesses on Page 8. In HDD, Western Digital is a well-known leader in the mass storage market with an ability to generate consistent cash flow on a stand-alone basis. Our ability to lead the industry in bringing new innovations to the hard drive market to enable higher capacity points for mass market adoption has established Western Digital as a key strategic supplier to the world's global cloud service providers, storage OEM and distributors.\nThe massive opportunity is driven by the ongoing expansion of the cloud infrastructure connected to intelligent endpoints and powered by high-speed networks. Industry analysts estimate the HDD addressable market to grow at approximately 12% compounded annual growth rate to $25 billion over the next 3 years, with cloud representing over 90% of the total addressable market. The cloud represents an incredibly large and growing end market for Western Digital and we are well positioned to address customer storage needs.\nMoving to our flash business on Page 10. The Western Digital flash business is well known for its broad go-to-market channels, enviable premium brand retail franchise and strong client SSD portfolio. Industry analysts forecast the flash market to grow at approximately 15% compounded annual growth rate over the next 3 years to $89 billion in calendar year 2025. We believe content increases in the consumer and client end markets as well as explosive growth of data created in the cloud by emerging applications such as generative AI, virtual reality and autonomous driving are driving a faster growth in flash versus HDD.\nThe highlight of our consumer end market is the strength of our SanDisk brand of retail products and our suite of high-performance SSDs for gaming enthusiasts. The brand recognition and affinity, combined with our unmatched presence across the world, is a great setup for the business on a stand-alone basis.\nOur successful 23-year partnership with Kioxia continues to provide us a reliable of high-performance, low-cost flash. Together, we have successfully brought to market numerous generations of flash technology with the industry's lowest cost and best capital efficiency. The joint venture fabs produce over 30% of the world's bits, and our joint memory technology road map remains incredibly well positioned, especially as we lead the industry's transition to wafer bonding. We will likely host an Investor Day closer to the time of the spin-off of our flash business to give investors greater clarity into the historical and future outlook for each of our businesses, along with the intended capital structures for each business.\nWith that, I'd like to turn to first quarter fiscal '24 earnings review and business update. Western Digital's first quarter results exceeded our expectations as the team's efforts to bolster business agility, drive innovation and rightsize the business have enabled us to capitalize on enhanced earning power in an improving environment. We reported first quarter revenue of $2.75 billion and a non-GAAP loss per share of $1.76. Our ability to develop differentiated and innovative products across a broad range of end markets has resulted in sequential margin improvement across both flash and HDD businesses.\nIn flash, healthy inventory levels on our balance sheet and signs that flash pricing is beginning to inflect have laid the groundwork for further gross margin improvements. Our broad go-to-market channels' enviable retail franchise and strong client SSD portfolio have enabled us to shift bits to the most attractive end market categories and achieve 26% sequential bit growth as well as upside in gross margin. In HDD, our industry-leading 26-terabyte UltraSMR drive became the highest nearline volume runner in just 2 quarters, which demonstrates Western Digital's aerial density leadership and ability to deliver high-volume innovative technologies to data center customers worldwide.\nDuring the quarter, demand in consumer and client continued to improve, exceeding our expectations. In consumer, flash revenue has returned to growth on a year-over-year basis, led by strong content increases and unit growth. In client, PC and component demand also exceeded our expectations, and demand for gaming consoles and mobile remained resilient. In cloud, demand for both hard drive and flash products remain subdued.\nI'll now turn to the business updates, starting with flash. During the quarter, flash revenue increased sequentially led by record exabyte shipments and continued content growth in consumer and client end markets, including PCs and all retail products as we continue to optimize bit placement in an improving environment. WD Black, which is optimized for gaming, continued to perform well with bit shipments more than doubling and content per unit increasing over 50% year-over-year.\nWe are in an excellent position from both the flash technology and capital efficiency perspective. Today, a majority of products we are shipping are based on BiCS5, the most capital-efficient node in the 3D era, that continues to provide an amazing cost structure and efficient capital spending. As we look into calendar year '24, we are ramping an array of QLC-based client SSDs based on BiCS6 technology to lead the expected industry transition to QLC. After BiCS6, we remain on track to introduce a broad range of high-performance products based on BiCS8 technology with its unique chip bonded on array architecture.\nTurning to HDD. Revenue declined due to lower nearline exabyte shipments driven by subdued demand from our cloud customers and slower-than-expected recovery in China. However, demand for consumer and client hard drives was stable. Western Digital has continued to lead the industry in driving innovation within the nearline market. Our ability to bring innovation into mass market drives that are quickly deployed into cloud data centers is reflected in our results as we successfully led the industry's transition to SMR-based nearline drives.\nSpecifically, our 26-terabyte UltraSMR drive, which we first announced at our Investor Day, accounted for nearly half of our nearline exabyte shipments with total SMR shipments exceeding the 40% goal we laid out in the same quarter a year prior. We are on track with our 28-terabyte UltraSMR drive qualification and have a clear road map of ePMR and UltraSMR-based innovations into the 40-terabyte range. These developments are a result of the choices we have made in the past few years through a combination of product R&D and manufacturing capabilities, and we are proud of how we have been executing against our strategy.\nLooking ahead to the fiscal second quarter. In flash, we expect both modest bit and ASP improvement and a decline in underutilization charges to drive continued sequential improvement in both revenue and gross margin. In HDD, we expect higher nearline shipments and seasonal demand in consumer end market to drive sequential revenue growth. We anticipate our value-based price efforts and lower underutilization charges will lead to sequential revenue and gross margin improvement in the quarter and through the rest of fiscal year '24. As we continue to execute against our HDD product road map, we are setting the stage for profitable growth for years to come.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Wissam.\n\nWissam G. Jabre\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Western Digital Corporation\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. As David mentioned, fiscal first quarter results exceeded the guidance ranges provided in July. Total revenue for the quarter was $2.75 billion, up 3% sequentially and down 26% year-over-year. Non-GAAP loss per share was $1.76.\nLooking at end markets for the fiscal first quarter. Cloud represented 32% of total revenue at $0.9 billion, down 12% sequentially and 52% year-over-year. Sequentially, the decline was primarily due to lower nearline hard drive shipments to data center customers. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to declines in shipments for both hard drive and flash products.\nClients represented 42% of total revenue at $1.1 billion, up 11% sequentially and down 7% year-over-year. Sequentially, the increase was due to growth in flash bit shipments. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to declines in flash pricing. Consumer represented 26% of revenue at $0.7 billion, up 14% sequentially and $0.08 year-over-year. On both a sequential and year-over-year basis, the increase was driven by both higher content per unit and increased unit shipments in flash.\nTurning now to revenue by segment. In the fiscal first quarter, flash revenue was $1.6 billion, up 13% sequentially and down 10% year-over-year. This marks the second consecutive quarter of sequential increase. Sequentially, flash ASPs decreased 10% on a blended basis and 4% on a like-for-like basis. We shipped a record amount of flash bits in the quarter with shipments increasing 26% sequentially and 49% year-over-year.\nHDD revenue was $1.2 billion, down 8% sequentially and 41% year-over-year. Sequentially, total HDD exabyte shipments decreased 5% and average price per unit increased 13% to $112. On a year-over-year basis, total HDD exabyte shipments decreased 42% and average price per unit decreased 10%.\nMoving to gross margin and expenses. Please note that my comments will be related to non-GAAP results unless stated otherwise. Gross margin for the first quarter was 4.1%, which was at the higher end of the guidance range provided in July and included $225 million in underutilization expenses and $9 million in other onetime charges. In total, these charges represented an 8.5 percentage point headwind to gross margin.\nFlash gross margin was negative 10.3%. Underutilization charges due to reduced manufacturing volumes were $142 million and flash inventory write-downs were $9 million, resulting in a combined 9.7 percentage points headwind to gross margin. HDD gross margin was 22.9%. Underutilization charges were higher than expected at $83 million or a 7 percentage point headwind to gross margin.\nWe continue to tightly manage our operating expenses, which were down 19% year-over-year to $555 million, well below our guidance range. Operating loss was $443 million, which included underutilization charges and inventory write-downs totaling $234 million. Income tax expense in the fiscal first quarter was $25 million. Net loss per share was $1.76, inclusive of a $15 million dividend associated with the convertible preferred equity.\nOperating cash flow for the first quarter was an outflow of $626 million, and free cash flow was an outflow of $544 million. Free cash flow included a payment of $523 million for the IRS settlement and $191 million cash received from the sale and leaseback of our facility in Milpitas, California.\nInventory declined $201 million sequentially to $3.5 billion. Days of inventory declined 10 days to 120 days. Flash inventory declined by nearly $400 million, driven by record bit shipments in the quarter and proactive actions taken to reduce wafer starts. Days of inventory for flash have reached the lowest level in nearly 4 years. HDD inventory grew by nearly $200 million due to the timing of certain purchases and lower-than-expected shipments.\nCash capital expenditures, which include the purchase and sale of property, plant and equipment, including the proceeds from our sale leaseback of our Milpitas facility and activity related to our flash joint ventures on the cash flow statement, represented a net cash inflow of $82 million. In the fiscal first quarter, we fully drew the $600 million delayed drought term loan facility. Gross debt outstanding was $7.7 billion at the end of the fiscal quarter. At the end of the quarter, total liquidity was $4.3 billion, including cash and cash equivalents of $2 billion and undrawn revolver capacity of $2.25 billion.\nBefore I cover guidance for the fiscal second quarter, I'll discuss the business outlook. For fiscal second quarter, we expect total revenue growth to be led by higher nearline HDD shipments and improved pricing in flash. We continue to adjust production into the second quarter to better align supply with demand and anticipate lower underutilization charges in both flash and HDD.\nFor our fiscal second quarter, our non-GAAP guidance is as follows. We expect revenue to be in the range of $2.85 billion to $3.05 billion. We expect gross margin to be between 10% and 12%, which includes underutilization charges across flash and HDD totaling $110 million to $130 million. We expect operating expenses to be between $560 million and $580 million. Interest and other expenses are expected to be approximately $105 million. We expect income tax expenses to be between $20 million and $30 million for fiscal second quarter and $80 million to $120 million for fiscal year 2024. We expect a preferred dividend of $15 million. We expect the loss per share of $1.35 to $1.05, assuming approximately 325 million shares outstanding.\nI'll now turn the call back over to David.\n\nDavid V. Goeckeler\n\nCEO & Director, Western Digital Corporation\n\nThanks, Wissam. Let me wrap up and then we'll open up for questions.\nWe are now emerging from a historic storage cyclical downturn, where all of the changes made in the past several years were evident in how well each business performed relative to peers. The first quarter of fiscal '24 builds upon the improvements we made in fiscal year '23 around disciplined supply and capital expenditure management while executing on our product innovation road map. We continue to tightly manage our operating expenses and are closely monitoring demand in our end markets to appropriately manage our inventory in both flash and HDD, all to improve sequential and year-over-year upside in our results.\nMoving forward, as we progress through fiscal year '24, we see an improving market environment in both businesses. With an improved position, the separation of the company unlocks value by creating 2 independent public companies with market-specific strategic focus, better positions each franchise to execute innovative technology and product development, capitalize on new growth opportunities, extend respective leadership positions and operate more efficiently with distinct capital structures.\nOkay, Peter. Let's open up for Q&A."

Welcome to Western Digital's Second Quarter Fiscal 2025 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this call is being recorded.\nNow I will turn the call over to Mr. Peter Andrew. Vice President, Financial Planning and Analysis and Investor Relations. You may begin, sir.\n\nT. Peter Andrew\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me today are David Goeckeler, Chief Executive Officer; and Wissam Jabre, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on management's current assumptions and expectations, and as such, does include risks and uncertainties.\nThese forward-looking statements include expectations for our product portfolio, our business plans and performance, the separation of our flash and HD businesses, ongoing market trends and our future financial results. We assume no obligation to update these statements. Please refer to our most recent financial report on Form 10-K and our other filings with the SEC for more information on the risks and uncertainties and that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations.\nWe will also make references to non-GAAP financial measures today. Reconciliations between the non-GAAP and comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the press release and other materials that are being posted in the Investor Relations section of our website.\nWith that, I will now turn the call over to David for introductory remarks.\n\nDavid V. Goeckeler\n\nDirector\n\nThanks, Peter. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining the call to discuss our second quarter fiscal year 2025 performance. As many of you know, with the completion of our separation later in the fiscal third quarter, I will become the CEO of SanDisk. As a result, this will be my last earnings call as the CEO of Western Digital.\nBefore we dive into our second quarter results, I want to express my gratitude to our employees, customers, partners and shareholders for their unwavering support throughout my tenure. It has been an honor and a privilege to serve as the CEO of Western Digital, and I'm immensely proud of what we've accomplished together to position both of our franchises for long-term success as stand-alone companies.\nNow on to the results. For the second fiscal quarter, Western Digital delivered revenue of $4.3 billion, non-GAAP gross margin of 35.9% and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.77. Our commitment to enduring quality and reliability driven by our industry-leading innovation and diversified portfolio has enabled us to navigate the current market dynamics effectively. While our HDD business is experiencing robust growth, particularly in high capacity enterprise drives, our flash segment faces temporary headwinds due to pricing pressure.\nDespite these challenges, we are strategically well positioned to capitalize on growing long-term storage demand from the AI Data cycle. Our HDD business continues to perform well. propelled by our cutting-edge UltraSMR technology. This innovation allows us to push the boundaries of storage capacity while maintaining the gold standard in reliability, quality and performance. The market has responded to our products enthusiastically, driving our HDD revenues to a 12-quarter high with a record non-GAAP gross margin.\nWe're seeing increasing adoption of our newer and higher density drives, underscoring their ability to meet the amount evolving demands of the storage market. I'm pleased to report that we're in the final stages of our plan to separate our flash and HDD businesses and expect this to be completed on schedule.\nDuring the second fiscal quarter, we achieved 2 crucial milestones completing our Form 10 filing and finalizing key financing activities necessary for the separation. Thanks to the meticulous planning and dedication of our teams were ready to operate as independent entities. We invite you to join us for our upcoming Investor Day on February 11 for SanDisk, on February 12 for Western Digital, where our respective management teams will share their strategic visions and demonstrate how each business will drive shareholder value as stand-alone entities.\nWe anticipate that within a few weeks after the Investor Day, Western Digital and SanDisk shares will begin trading as independent companies.\nTurning to our business units update. In Flash, revenue was stable and in line with expectations. Strength in client and consumer resulted in better-than-expected bit shipments. However, increased pricing pressure due to short-term oversupply from increased utilization rates throughout calendar year '24, coupled with customers working down inventory, offset our bit shipment results. Cloud pricing was a positive given continued AI-driven demand. Taken together, the result was a sequential decline in profitability.\nIn fiscal year 2024, consumer experienced growth across revenue, units and gross margins as the end market benefited from a market recovery. While revenue and units grew sequentially in the fiscal second quarter of '25, gross margin declined due to pricing pressure caused by oversupply in the broader NAND market. Despite this recent softening, our external SSD drive shipments grew 50% sequentially. Our efforts in bolstering consumer preference, expanding partnerships and launching our new creator series at CES, all provide SanDisk with the right foundation to drive organic demand and margin expansion.\nNow turning to the Flash outlook. We believe that we are currently in a mid-cycle pause. In the first -- in the fiscal third quarter, we expect bit shipments to be down with stronger demand in data center and mobile more than offset by lower bit shipments in PC, OEM and consumer. Given the stronger-than-anticipated pricing headwinds on we are proactively managing production levels to respond to ongoing inventory adjustments and evolving demand dynamics across our end markets.\nBy optimizing utilization and total capacity, with a key focus on delivering premium nodes, we aim to accelerate stabilizing profitability in this dynamic market. In this new era of NAND, with lower utilization and less intense CapEx environment relative to historical periods, we are seeing supply growth appropriately responding to the current short-term headwinds affecting demand, and we expect to see a recovery as we move through calendar year 2025. Specifically, we expect client inventory digestion to continue into the first half of calendar year '25 with normalization in the second half paving the way for a recovery that will enable the AI-driven PC ramp in the Windows refresh cycle to gain momentum.\nIn data center, we project cloud CapEx to continue to grow in year '25, and we continue to make good progress qualifying our cloud products with customers to capture our fair share of this market. Lastly, our consumer business continues to perform well and while we expect seasonal weakness in bit shipments, our premium brands are providing ASP support to the overall portfolio.\nWe look forward to discussing our views on the flash business at the SanDisk Investor Day on February 11. The team and I will discuss why we believe that our markets are strong and growing, how rapid adoption of AI is creating new opportunities, what differentiates SanDisk and how the Flash industry is evolving. We are very excited and believe you will be as well.\nOur HDD business delivered another quarter of strong performance, with data center revenue hitting an all-time high. This achievement underscores the strength of our nearline storage solutions and how well positioned we are to benefit from ongoing market tailwinds. The HDD business also achieved record gross margins as customers continue to increase the adoption of our higher capacity drives, and we shared in the TCO benefit provided by our innovative products.\nWe are operating in an environment where demand for our product exceeds supply. To proactively manage this, we continually work with our customers to get visibility into their future needs. In these tight conditions, we might see volatility in shipments from quarter-to-quarter, but over the longer term, we continue to progress toward a state of predictable business operations and sustainable profitable growth.\nTurning to the HDD outlook. In the fiscal third quarter, we anticipate continued momentum in data center to drive strong demand across our nearline portfolio. As I mentioned, our supply is now very tight, which is helping us get better visibility into long-term customer demand and enabling better planning for product deliveries in the coming quarters. Our customers increasingly appreciate the complexity of the HD supply chain and the need for us to better anticipate future demand.\nAs we continue to broaden adoption of our UltraSMR portfolio at our largest customers and complete the qualification and ramp of our newest drives we anticipate profitability will continue to improve in the coming quarters. The HD business' positive structural transformation continues to gain momentum. We remain focused on operational excellence, efficient cost structure and a strong commitment to maintaining a balanced supply-demand dynamic.\nWe are well positioned to continue delivering the most profitable and innovative product portfolio, while establishing long-term industry leadership through our earnings potential. During the upcoming WD Investor Day on February 12, [ Irving, ] and his team will provide a detailed overview of HCD's strategic road map.\nI want to take a moment to acknowledge the CFO transition announcement that we made 2 weeks ago. After nearly 3 years with us, Wissam so will be moving on to another opportunity. Wissam has been an outstanding partner and leader at Western Digital, helping us successfully navigate the company through the ups and downs of our end markets and build a strong financial profile at both HDD and flash. On behalf of the Board and everyone at Western Digital, I want to thank Wissam for his many contributions, including seeing us through the separation and wish him the best of luck in his next role.\nLet me now turn the call over to Wissam, who will discuss our fiscal second quarter results.\n\nWissam Jabre\n\nCFO & Senior VP of Finance, Dialog Semiconductor Plc\n\nThank you, David, and good afternoon, everyone. In the fiscal second quarter, Western Digital delivered results generally within the guidance ranges we gave in October in the face of a challenging pricing environment in flash. Total revenue for the quarter was $4.3 billion, up 5% sequentially and 41% year-over-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.77.\nLooking at end markets, Cloud represented 55% of total revenue at $2.3 billion, up 6% sequentially and more than doubling year-over-year. On a sequential basis, the growth was due to an increase in nearline HDD shipments, while flash was down. On a year-over-year basis, both HDD and Flash revenue grew. Client represented 27% of total revenue at $1.2 billion, down 3% sequentially and up 4% year-over-year.\nCompared to last quarter, Flash revenue declined as bit shipment growth was offset by pricing pressure, while HDD revenue was flat. Year-over-year, an increase in flash revenue was primarily due to higher ASPs as bid shipments declined and was partially offset by lower HDD revenue. Consumer represented 18% of revenue at $0.8 billion, up 14% sequentially and down 8% year-over-year. Sequentially, both flash and HDD bit shipments grew and drove revenue growth while pricing was a headwind. Year-over-year, the decrease was due to lower shipments in Flash and HDD and pricing in flash.\nTurning now to revenue by business unit. In the fiscal second quarter, Flash revenue was $1.9 billion, flat from last quarter and up 13% year-over-year. Sequentially, Flash ASPs decreased 13% on a like-for-like basis and 10% on a blended basis. Bit shipments were up 9% from the previous quarter and down 2% compared to last year. HDD revenue was $2.4 billion, up 9% sequentially and 76% year-over-year. The strength of our nearline portfolio delivered exabyte growth of 7% on a sequential basis and 93% versus a year ago.\nAverage price per unit increased 5% sequentially to $172. Nearline bit shipments were at a record level of 154 exabytes.\nMoving to the rest of the income statement. Please note, my comments will be related to non-GAAP results unless stated otherwise. Gross margin for the fiscal second quarter was 35.9%, which was below our guidance range. Sequentially, gross margin was down 2.6 percentage points and up 20.4 percentage points from a year ago. Flash gross margin was 32.5%, down 6.4 percentage points sequentially due to pricing pressure late in the quarter.\nFlash gross margin was up 24.6 percentage points from a year ago. In HDD, strong demand for nearline drives resulted in gross margin improvement of 0.5 percentage points on a sequential basis to 38.6% and 13.8 percentage points from a year ago. Operating expenses were down sequentially, at $674 million, including the synergy expenses of $17 million. Lower-than-expected operating expenses were due to the synergy costs being lower than expectations, while progress towards executing the SanDisk spend remains on track.\nIn addition, variable compensation was lower than expectations aligned with business performance. Our results demonstrate continued focus on cost discipline while making progress towards the completion of the business separation. Operating income was $864 million, down 2% sequentially driven by lower gross margin, partially offset by lower operating expenses.\nOperating margin was 20.2%, down approximately 140 basis points sequentially, but favorable compared to operating losses posted last year. Income tax expense was $105 million, and the effective tax rate was 14%. Earnings per share was $1.77. Operating cash flow for the fiscal second quarter was $403 million, and free cash flow generation was $335 million. Cash capital expenditures, which include the purchase of property, plant and equipment and activity related to flash joint ventures on the cash flow statement represented a cash outflow of $68 million.\nFiscal second quarter inventory was largely flat at $3.4 billion, with days of inventory declining by 9 days to 112 days. The decrease in HDD inventory was offset by an increase in flash inventory. Gross debt outstanding was $7.4 billion at the end of fiscal second quarter. Cash and cash equivalents were $2.3 billion, and total liquidity was $4.5 billion, including undrawn revolver capacity.\nDuring the fiscal second quarter, we successfully arranged financing for the upcoming separation of our business, which is a key milestone and the progress towards the spin of SanDisk.\nI'll now turn to the fiscal third quarter non-GAAP guidance for Western Digital on a combined basis. We anticipate overall revenue to be in the range of $3.75 billion to $3.95 billion. Gross margin is expected to be between 31.5% and 33.5%. We expect operating expenses to increase slightly to a range of $700 million to $720 million, including dis-synergy costs of $25 million to $40 million as we finalize the separation of our businesses. Interest and other expenses are anticipated to be approximately $100 million. The tax rate is expected to be between 14% and 16%. We expect EPS of $0.90 to $1.20 based on approximately 358 million shares outstanding.\nWe are looking forward to both of our Western Digital and SanDisk Investor Days in just a couple of weeks to discuss each business in more specific detail. For now, I'll provide directional perspective on expectations from each business in the fiscal third quarter.\nFor Flash, we expect revenue to decline sequentially in the mid-teens percentage and gross margin to decrease due to lower blended ASPs, higher cost per bit and underutilization charges of $20 million to $30 million as we manage our supply. Flash bits are expected to decline sequentially by mid-single-digit percentage. We also expect underutilization charges to continue in the June quarter.\nFor HDD, we expect revenue to decrease sequentially by mid- to high single-digit percentage on lower volume, while gross margin is expected to improve by approximately 50 basis points as average price per unit continues to trend higher. We are focused on executing the final stages of the spin and navigating current market dynamics while continuing to deliver robust financial performance. I would like to close by saying that it has been a tremendous honor to partner with David and a fantastic team at Western Digital.\nI'm extremely proud of the team's accomplishments over the past 3 years. There is no doubt in my mind that both the HDD and flash businesses are strong and resilient, and both will continue to provide industry-leading products to the marketplace while unlocking significant shareholder value for their respective shareholders.\nWith that, I'll now turn the call back over to David.\n\nDavid V. Goeckeler\n\nDirector\n\nThanks, Wissam. Our results this quarter reflect our efforts to actively manage near-term cyclicality across our end markets, knowing we have a solid foundation for future success that is underscored by our industry-leading product road map.\nAs we complete the separation, I am extremely confident in our respective team's ability to drive shareholder value in both the HDD and flash businesses. Both companies will continue to be driven by the structural long-term tailwinds of the AI data cycle and our ability to consistently offer our customers the most compelling and innovative storage solutions.\nBefore we move to the Q&A session, I'd like to highlight that we will also be joined today by Irving Tan, who will step into the role of CEO at Western Digital, and Luis Visoso, who will assume the position of CFO at SanDisk.\nPeter, let's start the Q&A."

Welcome to Western Digital's Fiscal Fourth Quarter 2022 Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this call is being recorded.\nI will now turn the call over to Mr. Peter Andrew, Vice President, FP&A and Investor Relations. You may begin.\n\nT. Peter Andrew\n\nVP of IR, Western Digital Corporation\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone.\nJoining me today are David Goeckeler, Chief Executive Officer; and Wissam Jabre, Chief Financial Officer.\nBefore we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements, including product portfolio expectations, business plans and performance, demand and market trends and financial outlook based on management's current assumptions and expectations and, as such, does include risks and uncertainties. We assume no obligation to update these statements. Please refer to our most recent financial report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC for more information on the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.\nWe will also make references to non-GAAP financial measures today. Reconciliations between the non-GAAP and comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the press release and other materials that are being posted in the Investor Relations section of our website.\nWith that, I'll now turn the call over to David for introductory remarks.\n\nDavid V. Goeckeler\n\nCEO & Director, Western Digital Corporation\n\nThank you, Peter. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining the call to discuss our fourth quarter and fiscal 2022 results.\nI'm pleased that the Western Digital team executed well and delivered solid results in light of the ongoing macro and geopolitical dynamics. We reported fourth quarter revenue of $4.5 billion, non-GAAP gross margin of 32% and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.78, all within the guidance ranges we provided in April.\nFiscal year 2022 revenue totaled $18.8 billion, and we reported non-GAAP earnings per share of $8.22. This compares to revenue of $16.9 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $4.55 in fiscal year 2021. We grew revenue 11% and EPS increased 81%, demonstrating progress in unlocking the earnings potential of our business.\nIn addition to strong financial performance, fiscal year 2022 was a hallmark year for Western Digital from an innovation, product development and execution perspective. In particular, we regained innovation leadership with the introduction of multiple products and technologies for the cloud.\nIn May, we announced a 26-terabyte drive, leveraging our OptiNAND and UltraSMR technologies as well as ePMR. Impressively, this means we've nearly doubled drive capacity relative to when I joined Western Digital just over 2 years ago.\nIn Flash, we expanded adoption of our NVMe enterprise SSD from 1 cloud titan to 3 as well as qualification at several enterprise OEM suppliers.\nFrom an organization perspective, we have bolstered the company's executive management team, further strengthening our ability to drive operational excellence, innovation and disciplined financial management.\nOn top of all of these achievements, we reduced debt by $1.7 billion and attained an investment-grade corporate rating, placing Western Digital on a solid financial foundation.\nBefore I jump into additional detail on the quarter, I wanted to provide an update on our strategic review. As you know, 2 months ago, we announced that we are reviewing potential strategic alternatives aimed at further optimizing long-term value for our shareholders. The Executive Committee of the Board, which I lead, continues to oversee the review and Elliott Management is participating alongside us under a nondisclosure agreement, along with other interested parties. We're evaluating a range of alternatives, including options for separating our market-leading Flash and HDD franchises. We are moving expeditiously, but this work will take time. We will not be answering any questions about the strategic review today given the ongoing nature and confidentiality of the process. We will provide updates in the future as appropriate.\nNow I'll provide updates on our HDD and Flash businesses. During the fiscal fourth quarter, strong demand from our cloud customers for our latest generation energy-assisted drives drove near-record nearline shipments of 111 exabytes. Total HDD revenue declined sequentially due primarily to consumer and client HDD demand.\nWe commenced commercial shipment of a number of products incorporating our OptiNAND technology. In addition to shipments of our 20- and 22-terabyte CMR drives, qualifications of our 26-terabyte SMR drive are underway as we noted at our product launch event in May. This SMR-enabled drive enables 20% higher capacity than our CMR variants, offering significantly better TCO for our cloud customers and further highlighting the performance-driven benefits of the innovation that Western Digital is packing into a hard drive.\nFinally, we are ramping a second cloud customer with SMR technology this quarter and remain on track to lead the industry's transition to SMR-based drives for the cloud.\nWe are very confident in our multiyear product road map for capacity enterprise drives, which combine ePMR, OptiNAND, UltraSMR and triple-stage actuators to deliver a cutting-edge portfolio of drives in commercial volumes at a wide variety of capacity points.\nWe also continue to invest in HAMR and the commercialization of this technology alongside our other HDD technologies that are leading the industry. The breadth and depth of this portfolio strongly positions us to be the provider of choice for the largest and most complex data centers in the world. Building on the expertise cultivated over decades of bringing to market industry-leading technologies, we are committed to leveraging our innovations to continue driving business results in capacity enterprise into the future.\nTurning to Flash. Revenue grew sequentially on an improving product mix and increased Flash supply. Growth in Flash during the quarter came primarily from enterprise SSD, with revenue more than doubling sequentially.\nGaming is another key growth market for us, where we continue to demonstrate the strength of our client SSD franchise, with exabyte shipment growing nearly 70% year-over-year. We have a leading position in gaming with our WD_BLACK brand being recognized globally for innovation, performance and quality. The latest example of this is our WD_BLACK SN850 NVMe SSD product certified for Sony PS5 game consoles which enables players to expand the high-speed storage capacity of their PS5 console and allows them to store and play both PS5 and PS4 games directly from the drive.\nOn the technology front, BiCS5 represented about half of our Flash revenue in the June quarter, up from 46% in the previous quarter. We are preparing to ramp BiCS6 late this calendar year and into 2023. Based on circuit under array architecture, BiCS6 enables many exciting high-performance products for 5G phones, SSDs and QLC flash.\nLet me now offer a few observations on the demand environment. In the cloud end market, we experienced strength in the fiscal fourth quarter as supply constraints at Western Digital and our end customers started to ease. Overall demand from our cloud customers has been consistently strong and we expect this strength in cloud to carry into the second half of calendar year 2022. We believe the accelerated digital transformation will continue to drive cloud growth and believe we are on track to generate about a half of our revenue from this market by fiscal year '25.\nOutside of cloud, our expectations for calendar year 2022 demand growth have moderated since our last earnings call. As the fiscal fourth quarter progressed, we saw consumer spending soften, impacting both retail Flash and HDD demand. This weakness has migrated to the consumer PC end market as we enter the second half of the calendar year.\nIn Client, the market generally expect PC shipments to decline approximately 10% in calendar year 2022. We are seeing our PC OEM customers aggressively right size their inventory to reflect current demand conditions, which will impact our business in this market in the second half of the calendar year. After going through that correction, we expect a more normal flow of business going forward as we believe PCs will continue to fulfill broader use cases as the foundation of the increasingly common hybrid enterprise, driving unit demand above pre-pandemic levels in richer SSD content.\nAll of these PC market dynamics are accelerating the final phase of the shift of client devices from HDD to flash technology. Consequently, the client HDD market is now declining at an accelerated rate relative to the period before the onset of the pandemic. To reflect this reality, we are now taking aggressive action to restructure our HDD manufacturing footprint to reflect this market dynamic.\nIn mobile, expectations for smartphone units have come down in recent months, led primarily by reduced demand in China. Industry analysts expect the smartphone industry unit volume to decrease by a mid-single-digit percentage year-over-year in calendar 2022.\nWhile we are well-positioned in supplying flash memory for 5G smartphones, we are also seeing our largest customers aggressively resetting their inventories for these products. We expect the inventory correction to be primarily impact our fiscal first quarter and return to market demand for the remainder of the fiscal year.\nIn consumer, we have a premium brand and a great franchise in the marketplace. In particular, we have developed an enviable position and excellent relationships with major brick-and-mortar retailers and online retailers across the globe, including Best Buy and Target in the U.S., MSH Group in Europe, JD.com in China and Officeworks in Australia. As a result of these strong relationships, our impressive scale, product breadth and trusted brand, we lead most consumer storage product categories.\nWhile macroeconomic factors and COVID measures have impacted consumer demand in the near term, our customers' loyalty and preference for the performance and quality of our solutions are key differentiators which will position Western Digital well for the upcoming back-to-school and holiday seasons.\nBefore turning the call over to Wissam, I want to leave you with a few takeaways. First, at the Investor Day, we laid out the case where the world of ever-increasing intelligent devices powered by the cloud is creating an astonishing amount of data, of which only a small percentage is stored. Our conviction remains strong and our view on near double-digit revenue growth remains intact.\nOver the past several years, the storage market has entered an era of accelerated growth led by the strength of the cloud market, which drove HDD revenue growth for Western Digital and the industry. In Flash, capital investments for incremental NAND bit growth are becoming more expensive, resulting in a more disciplined investment across the industry. At Western Digital, our long-standing and growing relationships with hyperscale and OEM customers across the world, coupled with our leadership in commercializing innovations for capacity enterprise hard drives and momentum with NVMe enterprise SSD for data center, has made us a trusted partner. This combination of rapid demand growth in storage, technology leadership and product momentum offer Western Digital opportunities for financial outperformance.\nWith that, let me now turn the call over to Wissam, who will discuss our fiscal fourth quarter results and provide an outlook for the fiscal first quarter.\n\nWissam Jabre\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Western Digital Corporation\n\nThanks, David, and good morning, everyone.\nAs David mentioned, overall results for the fiscal fourth quarter were in line with our expectations, reflecting the resilience and agility of our business model against such a dynamic macro environment.\nTotal revenue for the quarter was $4.5 billion, up 3% sequentially and down 8% year-over-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.78, within the guidance range we provided in April.\nFor the full fiscal year 2022, revenue was $18.8 billion, up 11% from fiscal 2021. Non-GAAP gross margin expanded 4.3 percentage points and non-GAAP operating margin increased 5.7 percentage points as we proactively manage our expenses resulting in non-GAAP EPS of $8.22, up 81% from last year.\nTurning to our end markets. For the fiscal fourth quarter, Cloud represented 46% of total revenue at $2.1 billion, up 18% sequentially and 5% from a year ago. Within Cloud, Western Digital's continued success in leading the industry transition to energy-assisted hard drives drove the growth. The continued ramp of our 18-terabyte and 20-terabyte drives drove a 7% year-over-year increase in nearline HDD revenue. Sequentially, nearline bit shipments increased 9% to 111 exabytes.\nIn Flash, enterprise SSD revenue more than doubled sequentially and was up 38% year-over-year.\nThe Client end market represented 36% of total revenue at $1.6 billion, down 5% sequentially and 14% year-over-year. On both a sequential and year-over-year basis, Client HDD led the revenue decline, while Flash revenue was roughly flat.\nConsumer represented 18% of revenue at $0.8 billion, down 9% sequentially and 23% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, the revenue decline was primarily due to lower HDD retail shipments. The year-over-year decrease was due to broad-based decline in retail products across HDD and Flash.\nFor the full fiscal year 2022, Cloud revenue increased 40% year-over-year, led by a 38% increase in nearline HDD. Flash product revenue for enterprise SSD applications more than doubled year-over-year.\nClient revenue decreased 3% year-over-year as growth in Flash was offset by a 30% decrease in Client HDD. Client HDD for PCs and notebooks represents just mid-single-digit percentage of total HDD revenue exiting the fiscal year.\nLastly, consumer revenue decreased 6% for the year, all attributed to a decline in retail HDD.\nTurning now to revenue by segment. In the fiscal fourth quarter, we reported Flash revenue of $2.4 billion, up 7% sequentially and down 1% year-over-year. Sequentially, Flash ASPs were up 2% on a blended basis and up slightly on a like-for-like basis. Flash bit shipments increased 6% sequentially and 11% year-over-year.\nHDD revenue of $2.1 billion was flat sequentially and down 15% year-over-year. Sequentially, total HDD exabyte shipments increased 1%, while the average price per HDD increased by 19% to $120 as our mix continues to transition towards the cloud. On a year-over-year basis, total HDD exabyte shipments decreased by 10% and average price per unit increased by 24%.\nAs we move to costs and expenses, my comments will be related to non-GAAP results unless stated otherwise.\nWe continue to exert disciplined financial management to drive better results. Gross margin for the fourth quarter was 32.3%, up 60 basis points sequentially and down 60 basis points year-over-year. Our Flash gross margin was 35.9%, up 30 basis points sequentially and 40 basis points year-over-year. On both a sequential and year-over-year basis, growth in enterprise SSD for data center applications led the improvement in gross margin. Our HDD gross margin was 28.2%, up 50 basis points sequentially and down 210 basis points year-over-year.\nOperating expenses of $760 million were below our guidance range as we continue to prudently manage our expenses.\nOperating income was $702 million, representing an 8% increase from the prior quarter and a 15% decrease year-over-year.\nOur tax rate was 11% for both the fiscal fourth quarter and fiscal year 2022.\nEarnings per share was $1.78 compared to $1.65 in the prior quarter and $2.16 in the year-ago quarter.\nOperating cash flow for the fourth quarter was $295 million, and free cash flow was an outflow of $97 million. Operating cash flow was impacted by revenue linearity.\nThe ramp back to normal production output at the Flash joint venture, timing of component deliveries to our factories and corporate-related control measures in China contributed to a back-end loaded quarter. Cash, capital expenditures, which include the purchase of property, plant and equipment, and activity related to our Flash joint ventures on our cash flow statement represented a cash outflow of $392 million in the fiscal fourth quarter.\nWe remain disciplined in investing in manufacturing capacity. Gross CapEx and cash CapEx for the fiscal year 2022 were $2.7 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively, below our expectation as we actively managed our capital investments.\nWe made a $150 million scheduled and discretionary debt repayment. Our gross debt outstanding was $7.1 billion at the end of the fiscal fourth quarter. We ended the quarter with $2.3 billion of total cash and cash equivalents.\nOur trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA at the end of the fourth quarter as defined in our credit agreement was $4.8 billion, resulting in a gross leverage ratio of 1.5x compared to 2.4x a year ago. As a reminder, our credit agreement includes $0.9 billion in depreciation add-back associated with the Flash Ventures. This amount is not reflected in the cash flow statement. Please refer to our earnings presentation on the Investor Relations website for further details.\nI'll now provide our view of both HDD and Flash businesses for the fiscal first quarter as well as comments on several key items for fiscal year 2023.\nFor the fiscal first quarter, we expect Flash to lead the sequential revenue decline as our customers right size their inventory. We expect a relatively modest decline in overall HDD revenue, primarily driven by client and consumer, with gross margins relatively flat.\nAs we look towards fiscal year 2023, we expect cash capital expenditures to be in line with our target model, within the range of 8% to 10% of total revenue. Total gross capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $3.2 billion.\nRegarding Flash CapEx, we remain excited about our technology road map despite what is clearly a volatile period in the memory industry. As we have discussed on prior calls, BiCS6 is a more capital-intensive technology node that will require an increase in capital expenditures. Our CapEx outlook for fiscal year 2023 reflects our commitment to technology leadership and will accelerate our path to leapfrog from BiCS6 to BiCS+ in the next several years.\nI am also pleased to share that the Flash JV Fab 7 manufacturing facility at Yokkaichi plant has been approved to receive a subsidy of up to JPY 92.9 billion from the Japanese government, further demonstrating the strategic importance of what is the world's largest NAND manufacturing facility.\nGiven the macro environment, we continue to actively manage our capital expenditures and supply. We are in discussion with our joint venture partner to adjust capital investments and align our production growth with demand.\nIn HDD, we will continue to focus our capital spending primarily in heads and media in order to meet the future growth in cloud demand. Offsetting these investments, we are taking aggressive actions to restructure our client HDD manufacturing footprint. We strive to optimize free cash flow generation in response to the macroeconomic dynamics.\nFor our fiscal first quarter, our non-GAAP guidance is as follows: We expect revenue to be in the range of $3.6 billion to $3.8 billion. We expect gross margin to be between 27.5% and 29.5%. We expect operating expenses to be between $760 million and $780 million. Interest and other expenses are expected to be approximately $70 million. Our tax rate is expected to be between 28% and 30% in the first quarter and for fiscal year 2023. This increase is due to the tax law changes that became effective for our fiscal year 2023, requiring the capitalization of certain R&D expenses that were previously eligible for immediate deduction from taxable income. These changes are expected to result in an immediate increase in our tax rate of approximately 12 percentage points, which will then decrease gradually over time.\nWe expect earnings per share to be between $0.35 and $0.65 in the first quarter, assuming approximately 319 million fully diluted shares outstanding.\nI'll now turn the call back over to David.\n\nDavid V. Goeckeler\n\nCEO & Director, Western Digital Corporation\n\nThanks, Wissam. Let me just wrap up, and then we'll open up for questions.\nIn summary, we continue to believe that we have built the right foundation for long-term growth. We have reignited our innovation, established discipline in spending and investment and remain consistent in deleveraging our balance sheet.\nThe innovation engine that drives TCO benefits and value to our customers, the multiple channels to deliver our products to market and the large and growing storage markets put us in a great position to capitalize on the opportunity presented by the proliferation of intelligent devices and rapidly accelerating data creation.\nWhile segments of our end markets are now going through an aggressive inventory adjustment as supply chain impacts of the pandemic start to ease and the macro economy softens, secular demand for storage continues to be strong and underpins the digital transformation that continues across all industries.\nI also want to thank our employees for their hard work during the fiscal year. Despite ongoing geopolitical and macro challenges, our team worked together to deliver strong financial performance for Western Digital. I am proud of what this team has accomplished and excited to see what we can do together in the next fiscal year.\nAll right. Peter, with that, let's open it up for Q&A."

Welcome to Western Digital's Fourth Quarter and Fiscal 2024 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.\nI'd now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Peter Andrew, Vice President, Financial Planning and Analysis and Investor Relations. You may begin.\n\nT. Peter Andrew\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me today are David Goeckeler, Chief Executive Officer; and Wissam Jabre, Chief Financial Officer.\nBefore we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon management's current assumptions and expectations, and as such, does include risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements include expectations for our product portfolio, our business plans and performance, the separation of our Flash and HDD businesses, ongoing market trends and our future financial results. We assume no obligation to update these statements. Please refer to our most recent financial report on Form 10-K and our other filings with the SEC for more information on the risks and uncertainties and that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations.\nWe will also make references to non-GAAP financial measures today. Reconciliations between the non-GAAP and comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the press release and other materials that are being posted in the Investor Relations section of our website.\nWith that, I'll now turn the call over to David for introductory remarks.\n\nDavid V. Goeckeler\n\nCEO & Director, Western Digital Corporation\n\nThanks, Peter. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining the call to discuss our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2024 performance.\nWestern Digital delivered strong results with fiscal fourth quarter revenue of $3.8 billion, non-GAAP gross margin of 36.3% and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.44. For the fiscal year 2024, revenue totaled $13 billion. We have maintained our strategic focus on aligning our portfolio of industry-leading products with growth opportunities across a broad range of end markets to mitigate volatility and while structurally improving our through-cycle profitability for both Flash and HDD.\nBefore we discuss our performance, I want to provide our views on where the storage market is heading and how we are well positioned to capitalize on these growth opportunities. Our diverse portfolio, coupled with the structural changes we have made to strengthen our operations, is enabling us to benefit from the broad recovery we are beginning to see across our end markets.\nIn addition, the AI Data Cycle is increasing the need for storage and creating new demand drivers across both Flash and HDD. These AI systems process and analyze existing data generate new data and require substantial storage for training, operating in a continuous cycle of increasing data consumption, processing and generation.\nAs AI technologies advance, data storage systems must deliver the capacity and performance necessary to support the computational demands of large sophisticated models while managing vast volumes of data. Given this landscape, we expect Flash to benefit from both AI training and inference while HDD is poised to benefit at both the input and output stages of these AI models.\nTo address the growing performance, power and capacity requirements, we have developed our Flash and HDD product road maps to meet our end customer storage needs across the entire AI Data Cycle. We introduced the industry-leading high-performance PCIe Gen 5 SSD to support AI training and inference. A high-capacity 64 terabyte SSD for optimizing the build-out of rapid AI Data Lake in the world's highest capacity ePMR UltraSMR and 2-terabyte hard drive for cost effective and deep content storage at scale. These new offerings demonstrate our continued commitment to innovation and market leadership.\nAs we enter fiscal year 2025, we are well positioned to capture the long-term growth opportunities in data storage and believe the AI Data Cycle will be a significant incremental growth driver for the storage industry.\nBefore I dive further into business updates, I want to update you on our separation plans. I am pleased with the progress our team has made as we continue to drive to completing the work required to separate the company at the end of the calendar year. As part of the ongoing preparation for the separation, we anticipate beginning to incur separation dis-synergy costs in the second half of the calendar year. Wissam will briefly discuss the anticipated impact of these costs.\nI'll now turn to business updates. Starting with Flash. The growth in revenue was driven by the recovery in cloud and a shift of our client mix to gaming and mobile, partially offset by a decline in consumer. Our focus on driving higher through-cycle profitability is reflected in our results as we proactively mix bids across our end markets. Our innovative offerings remain at the forefront of the market, reinforcing our competitive position and bolstering our growth prospects. For example, our new QLC-based client SSDs, which grew 50% on a sequential exabyte basis, offer significantly better performance than our previous generation TLC products.\nCombining this high-performance node with our in-house controller development, enable us to provide a portfolio of client SSDs that deliver unmatched performance and value. We believe these products will lead the industry's transition to QLC flash.\nDuring our new era of NAND webinar last month, we introduced the world's highest capacity BiCS8 2-terabyte QLC memory die specifically designed to meet growing data center and AI storage needs. Built on a chip bonded to array architecture, BiCS8 reinforces Western Digital and Kioxia's leadership in cost and capital efficiency as well as superior I/O performance by integrating wafer bonding in advanced 3D manufacturing to establish a groundbreaking foundation for future scalability of 3D NAND. In addition, our 64 terabyte enterprise SSD is now being sampled with plans for volume shipment later this calendar year.\nFurthermore, our PCIe Gen 5 based enterprise SSD delivers best-in-class read performance as well as power efficiency. We are seeing significant interest in this product, which is currently qualifying at a hyperscaler with ramp expected in the second half of this calendar year. We'll talk more about our Flash road map at the upcoming Flash Memory Summit in early August.\nTurning to the Flash outlook. Throughout the fourth quarter, our product mix was dynamic as we proactively mix bits between our end markets in response to the softness we are seeing in the more transactional markets such as consumer and channel. Our success in identifying the most profitable approach to allocating bits is reflected in the growth of both our revenue and gross margin. As we look into the first quarter, in addition to the mix environment we saw in the fourth quarter, we expect the continued ramp of our new enterprise SSD offerings and seasonal strength in mobile drive mid- to high-teens bit growth on a sequential basis.\nFor the full fiscal year 2025, we expect enterprise SSDs to represent a double-digit percent share in our portfolio mix. The new era of NAND is driving a period of change, and we are going to remain disciplined in managing our capital spending. The layers focus race is behind us. The emphasis is now shifting towards strategically timing the economic introduction of new longer-lasting nodes. Innovation now means enhancing power efficiency, performance and capacity within these nodes, while capital decisions increasingly prioritize opportunities for margin expansion and revenue growth.\nTurning to HDD. Revenue growth was driven by strength in nearline demand and improved pricing. By leveraging our SMR leadership and lean cost structure, we have surpassed our target gross margin range, underscoring our ongoing commitment to improve future profitability. The HDD business has undergone a remarkable transformation in recent quarters, marked by strategic initiatives aimed at introducing the most innovative, high-capacity products to market. We have increased our profitability meaningfully by restructuring our manufacturing footprint and optimizing our cost structure to drive operational efficiency all while qualifying and ramping our SMR technology.\nWe continue to structurally change the way we are operating our HDD business. With better visibility into future demand, operational excellence and a commitment to sustaining supply-demand balance, we are poised to continue our trajectory of bringing highly innovative products to market while increasing profitability into the future.\nOn the technology front, we ship samples of our 32-terabyte UltraSMR/ePMR nearline hard drives to select customers. These drives feature advanced triple-stage actuators and OptiNAND technology which are designed for seamless qualification, integration and deployment in hyperscale cloud and enterprise data centers while maintaining exceptional reliability.\nWith this in mind, we are well positioned to deliver the industry's highest capacity hard drives and the best TCO.\nTurning to the HDD outlook. As we look to the fiscal first quarter, we expect further growth driven by greater demand and more favorable pricing. Our cloud customers continue to transition to SMR, and we anticipate a third major cloud vendor to begin the ramp of adopting SMR in the fiscal first quarter. Our leading products and lean cost structure have supported ongoing profitability improvements in our HDD business. We remain focused on driving higher margins to reflect the significant innovation and TCO improvements we deliver to our customers.\nOur strategic approach to commercializing ePMR, OptiNAND and UltraSMR technologies has proven to be the winning strategy, enabling us to surpass our gross margin target for HDDs in the midst of AI's emergence as another pivotal growth driver for the industry.\nLet me now turn the call over to Wissam, who will discuss our fiscal fourth quarter results.\n\nWissam G. Jabre\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Western Digital Corporation\n\nThanks, David. And good afternoon, everyone. In the fiscal fourth quarter, Western Digital delivered great results with gross margin and earnings per share exceeding the high end of the guidance range. Total revenue for the quarter was $3.8 billion, up 9% sequentially and 41% year-over-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.44.\nLooking at end markets, Cloud represented 50% of total revenue at $1.9 billion. The sequential growth of 21% is attributed to higher nearline shipments and pricing in HDD, coupled with increased bid shipments and pricing in enterprise SSD. The 89% year-over-year increase was due to higher shipments and price per unit in nearline HDDs along with higher enterprise SSD bit shipments. New line bit shipments were at a record level of 125 exabytes, up 16% from the previous quarter and 113% compared to fiscal fourth quarter of 2023.\nClient represented 32% of total revenue at $1.2 billion. The sequential increase of 3% was due to the increase in flash ASPs, offsetting a decline in flash bit shipments while HDD revenue decreased slightly. The 16% year-over-year growth was driven by higher flash ASPs. Consumer represented 18% of total revenue at $0.7 billion. Sequentially, the 7% decrease was due to lower flash and HDD bit shipments, partially offset by higher ASPs in both Flash and HDD. The 5% year-over-year increase was driven by improved flash ASPs and bit shipments.\nFor fiscal year 2024, revenue was $13 billion, up 6% from fiscal year 2023. Non-GAAP gross margin increased 7.1 percentage points to 22.8% and non-GAAP operating margin increased 8.7 percentage points to 3.9%. Non-GAAP loss per share was $0.20.\nLooking at end markets for fiscal year 2024, Cloud revenue increased 2% year-over-year due to higher demand for capacity enterprise HDDs and improved pricing. For the year, client and consumer revenue grew by 7% and 9%, respectively, due to higher flash bit shipments.\nTurning now to revenue by segment. In the fiscal fourth quarter, Flash revenue was $1.8 billion, up 3% sequentially and 28% year-over-year. Compared to last year -- last quarter, Flash ASPs were up 14% on a blended basis and 11% on a like-for-like basis. Bit shipments decreased 7% sequentially and 3% compared to last year as we proactively mixed flash bits to maximize profitability. HDD revenue was $2 billion, up 14% from last quarter as exabyte shipments increased 12% and average price per unit increased 12% to $163. Compared to the fiscal fourth quarter of 2023, HDD revenue grew 55%, while total exabyte shipments and average price per unit were up 72% and 64%, respectively.\nMoving to the rest of the income statement. Please note, my comments will be related to non-GAAP results unless stated otherwise. Our focus on improving through-cycle profitability in both Flash and HDD has shown great progress. In the fiscal fourth quarter, total gross margin reached 36.3%, well above the guidance range. Gross margin improved by 7 percentage points sequentially and 32.4 percentage points year-on-year due to better pricing and cost reduction as well as higher volume.\nWithin Flash, by proactively allocating bits between end markets and executing on our cost reduction initiatives, we have improved gross margin for 4 consecutive quarters. Flash gross margin was 36.5%, up 9.1 percentage points compared to last quarter and 48.4 percentage points year-over-year.\nIn HDD, by offering a leading product portfolio and running efficient manufacturing operations focused on cost discipline, we continue to make progress in improving profitability. We delivered a gross margin of 36.1%, exceeding the long-term target range, up 5 percentage points sequentially and 15.4 percentage points compared to fiscal fourth quarter of 2023.\nOperating expenses were $700 million for the quarter, above our guided range, primarily due to higher variable compensation associated with better-than-expected profitability. Operating income was $666 million, tax expense was $17 million, earnings per share was $1.44. Operating cash flow was $366 million and free cash flow was $282 million.\nCash capital expenditures, which include the purchase of property, plant and equipment, and activity related to flash joint ventures on the cash flow statement represented a cash outflow of $84 million. For fiscal year 2024, cash capital expenditures were $244 million or 1.9% of revenue, excluding the proceeds from the sale leaseback of our Milpitas facility. Year-over-year, this represented a 69% decline.\nFourth quarter inventory was up from the prior quarter at $3.3 billion, with days of inventory increasing from 119 days to 126 days. A decline in HDD inventory was more than offset by an increase in Flash inventory. Gross debt outstanding was $7.5 billion at the end of the fiscal fourth quarter. Cash and cash equivalents were $1.9 billion, and total liquidity was $4.1 billion including undrawn revolver capacity of $2.2 billion. During the quarter, we paid down the remaining $300 million of the delayed drought term loan.\nI'll now turn to the fiscal first quarter non-GAAP guidance. We anticipate both Flash and HDD revenue and gross margin to improve on a sequential basis as we continue to drive improvements in profitability across our businesses. We anticipate revenue to be in the range of $4 billion to $4.2 billion. Gross margin is expected to be between 37% and 39%. We expect operating expenses to increase slightly to a range of $695 million to $715 million. A decrease in variable compensation will be offset by the synergy costs as we continue to make progress executing on the separation plans.\nIncluded in this range are dis-synergy costs of $15 million to $25 million. We expect the synergy costs in the fiscal second quarter to be between $35 million and $45 million. Interest and expenses are anticipated to be approximately $110 million. Tax rate is expected to be between [ 15% and 17%. ] We expect earnings per share of $1.55 to $1.85 based on approximately 360 million shares outstanding. As shown in our guidance, we remain committed to driving higher profitability while maintaining focus on cost and capital discipline.\nI'll now turn the call back over to David.\n\nDavid V. Goeckeler\n\nCEO & Director, Western Digital Corporation\n\nThanks, Wissam. Today's results and guidance underscore Western Digital's strong execution with promising growth opportunities ahead. We delivered solid results as we doubled down on our strategic initiatives and product road map, capitalizing on robust growth prospects for both Flash and HDD. The emergence of the AI Data Cycle marks an incredibly exciting transformation in our industry, driving fundamental shifts across our end markets.\nLooking ahead to fiscal year '25 we are well positioned to leverage our leadership positions to spearhead innovative technologies and delivered unparalleled value for our customers.\nPeter, let's begin the Q&A. Thank you."

Welcome to Western Digital's Second Quarter Fiscal 2024 Analyst Call. [Operator Instructions] Now I will turn the call over to Mr. Peter Andrew, VP of FP&A and IR. You may begin.\n\nT. Peter Andrew\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nWell, thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me today are David Goeckeler, Chief Executive Officer; and Wissam Jabre, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on management's current assumptions and expectations, and as such, does include risks and uncertainties.

With that, I will now turn the call over to David for introductory remarks.\n\nDavid V. Goeckeler\n\nCEO & Director, Western Digital Corporation\n\nThank you, Peter. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the call to discuss our second quarter of fiscal year 2024 results. Western Digital's second quarter results demonstrate that the structural changes we have put in place over the last few years and the strategy we have been executing are producing significant outperformance across our Flash and HDD businesses. I am confident that building leading products across a broad range of end markets, closely controlling our product costs through focused R&D and manufacturing and bolstering the agility of our business will allow us to improve through-cycle profitability and dampen business cycles.\nAs a result, we reported revenue of $3 billion, non-GAAP gross margin of 15.5% and a non-GAAP loss per share of $0.69, all of which met or exceeded the non-GAAP guidance ranges we provided in October. Before discussing the business details, I want to provide some comments on the emerging trends we are seeing and how the changes we have made position our Flash and [ HDD ] businesses to benefit.\nIn Flash, we've been able to navigate business cycles by managing inventory proactively, offering a broad range of products and optimizing capital efficiency through our joint venture partnership with Kioxia. These successful efforts are reflected in our best-in-class gross margin throughout the cycle. During the quarter, our portfolio strategy to dynamically allocate bit shipments drove upside in ASPs and gross margin. Looking ahead, we will continue to take a disciplined approach to our supply and capital investments. Consequently, we continue to proactively manage our bit shipments to structurally align our supply and inventory with customer demand and improve through-cycle profitability into the future.\nIn addition to the recovery in both flash and HDD markets, we believe storage is entering a multiyear growth period. Generative AI has quickly emerged as yet another growth driver and transformative technology that is reshaping all industries, all companies in our daily lives. Importantly, industry analysts estimate that the edge now represents approximately 80% of total NAND bit shipments, an increase from approximately 75% in calendar year 2022, which is another indication that cloud demand was significantly pulled in during the pandemic.\nIn addition, we believe the second wave of generative AI-driven storage deployments will spark a client and consumer device refresh cycle and reaccelerate content growth in PC, smartphone, gaming and consumer in the coming years. Our flash portfolio is extremely well positioned to benefit from this emerging secular tailwind.\nIn HDD, Western Digital's leading ePMR platform and enhanced UltraSMR technology allow us to provide the highest capacity drives for mass market deployment. We believe this innovative technology and portfolio strategy enable us to offer the best TCO to our cloud customers and outperform our peers throughout the cycle. We are confident that the multi-quarter nearline demand headwinds have subsided as our major cloud customers have reengaged with us. We anticipate our financial outperformance resulting from profitable share gains to become more evident as nearline demand accelerates into the second half of fiscal year 2024 and beyond.\nMoving on to end market commentary. During the quarter, revenue in the cloud end market returned to sequential growth for the first time in 6 quarters. The sequential revenue growth was led by an increase in nearline shipments. In client, sequentially, revenue declined slightly as the increase in flash ASPs was offset by a decline in bit shipments as we proactively optimized product mix. In consumer, the sequential revenue growth was led by seasonal strength in flash bit shipments into retail and an increase in flash ASPs.\nI'll now turn to business updates, starting with flash. During the quarter, the sequential revenue increase was due to stronger execution in driving price inflection by optimizing bit shipment across our broad go-to-market channels into the consumer and client end markets, resulting in stronger-than-planned ASP increase. In particular, our WD Black gaming SSD product, which offers high reliability, best-in-class performance, expansive storage capabilities in a hyper realistic gaming experience achieved a new record revenue with bit shipment growth of over 50% year-over-year.\nOn the technology front, we remain on track to ramp an array of QLC-based client SSDs utilizing BiCS6 technology. Our ability to combine this new high-performance node with our in-house controller development allows us to offer a portfolio of client SSDs with unmatched performance and value. We expect these products to lead the transition to QLC flash in calendar year 2024.\nAdditionally, BiCS8 yield is progressing well, and we remain on track to productize this technology. Turning to HDD. The sequential revenue increase was driven by improving nearline demand and pricing. Moreover, we are encouraged by demand in China with revenue doubling on a sequential and year-over-year basis, both of which were ahead of our expectations. We anticipate year-over-year growth in HDD throughout this calendar year. In both the first and second quarters, we shipped approximately 1 million UltraSMR drives per quarter. We forecast UltraSMR hard drive shipments to increase significantly in the fiscal third quarter and SMR drive shipments to continue to outgrow that of CMR drives going forward.\nImportantly, the adoption of UltraSMR is broadening to our major customers worldwide, including a third cloud titan in the U.S. this year as well as hyperscale and smart video customers in China. We expect to complete the qualifications of our 26-terabyte and 28-terabyte UltraSMR drives at these customers this quarter and throughout the calendar year and forecast SMR to comprise the majority of nearline demand by calendar year 2025.\nWe have strong conviction that our portfolio strategy of first commercializing Western Digital's industry-leading UltraSMR technology, which will be followed by our transition from ePMR to HAMR, offers the best TCO to our customers in both the near and long term while delivering leading portfolio profitability in the industry. Over the next several years, we will be introducing a number of exciting products, including multiple generations of nearline drives combining ePMR, OptiNAND and UltraSMR technologies in the 30- to upper 30-terabyte capacity range, all of which will be ready for high-volume production to support the explosion of AI training data and content.\nBefore I turn over to Wissam, I wanted to share some perspectives on our outlook. In Flash, starting with demand in calendar year 2024, we estimate industry bit growth to be around the mid-teens percentage, similar to the growth rate in calendar year 2023. On the supply side, we estimate that [ fab ] out bit production growth to remain in the mid-single-digit percentage range. We believe our business agility and our highly capital-efficient and low-cost BiCS architecture have enabled us to align supply with demand via nodal transition much more quickly than our peers. We will continue our disciplined approach to dynamically managing our inventory capacities and capital expenditures to keep our supply aligned with end customer demand.\nAlthough flash pricing has started to increase, our profitability and cash generation continue to be well below the level that justify an increase in capital investments. We anticipate wafer equipment spending will remain at historic lows in the near term and flash to be undersupplied for an extended period of time. Overall, we will continue to focus on allocating our bids to the most attractive end markets and anticipate flash ASP increases to be the primary revenue growth driver throughout this calendar year.\nIn HDD, our competitive portfolio strategy has enabled us to consistently achieve profitable share gain in the last 2 calendar years. We are confident that this trend will continue as nearline demand continues to improve and we continue to ramp our UltraSMR-enabled products. Let me now turn the call over to Wissam, who will discuss our financial second quarter results.\n\nWissam G. Jabre\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Western Digital Corporation\n\nThank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Following on David's comments, the success of the strategy we have been executing is reflected in our financial performance. Non-GAAP results in the fiscal second quarter exceeded or were at the high end of the guidance ranges we provided in October. Total revenue for the quarter was $3 billion, up 10% sequentially and down 2% year-over-year. Non-GAAP loss per share was $0.69 as strong execution with our broad go-to-market channels benefited flash ASP and gross margin.\nLooking at end markets, cloud represented 35% of total revenue at $1.1 billion, up 23% sequentially and down 13% year-over-year. Sequentially, the growth is attributed to higher nearline shipments to that at center customers and better nearline pricing. Nearline bit shipments were 67 exabytes, up 23%. The year-over-year decrease was due to lower eSSD bit shipments.\nOn a year-over-year basis, HDD cloud revenue increased for the first time in 6 quarters. Client represented 37% of total revenue at $1.1 billion, down 2% sequentially and up 3% year-over-year. Sequentially, an increase in flash ASP was more than offset by a decline in flash bit shipments. The year-over-year increase was due to higher flash shipments primarily driven by client SSD shipments into PC applications more than offsetting a decline in ASP. Consumer represented 28% of total revenue at $0.8 billion, up 15% sequentially and 6% year-over-year. Sequentially, the growth was primarily due to seasonal strength in flash bit shipments. On a year-over-year basis, the increase in flash bit shipments was partially offset by a decline in flash ASP as well as lower HDD shipments.\nTurning now to revenue by business segment. In the fiscal second quarter, Flash revenue was $1.7 billion, growing 7% sequentially as flash ASPs increased 10% on a blended basis and 7% on a like-for-like basis, stronger than anticipated entering the quarter. Bit shipments decreased 2% after record shipments in the prior quarter. On a year-over-year basis, Flash revenue grew slightly with a 21% increase in bit shipments offsetting lower prices.\nHDD revenue was $1.4 billion, increasing 14% sequentially as total exabyte shipments increased 14% and average price per unit increased 9% to $122. On a year-over-year basis, HDD revenue declined 6%, while total exabyte shipments increased 2% and average price per unit increased 23%.\nMoving to gross margin and expenses. Please note, my comments will be related to non-GAAP results unless stated otherwise. Gross margin was 15.5%, above the guidance range provided in October and improving 11.4 percentage points sequentially while declining 1.9 percentage points year-over-year. The sequential increase was primarily driven by higher flash ASPs as we proactively optimized product mix, which more than offset higher than anticipated underutilization charges of $156 million or a 5.1 percentage point headwind.\nFlash gross margin was higher than expected at 7.9%, up 18.2 percentage points sequentially and down 6.6 percentage points year-over-year. This includes underutilization charges of $107 million or a 6.4 percentage points headwind to gross margin. HDD gross margin was 24.8%, up 1.9 percentage points sequentially and 4.1 percentage points year-over-year. This includes underutilization charges of $49 million or a 3.6 percentage point headwind.\nWe continue to tightly manage operating expenses, which were $561 million for the quarter, down 15% year-over-year and at the lower end of the guidance range. Operating loss in the quarter was $91 million, which included underutilization charges of $156 million. Fiscal second quarter loss per share was $0.69, inclusive of a $14 million dividend associated with the convertible preferred shares. Operating cash flow for the second quarter was an outflow of $92 million, and free cash flow was an outflow of $176 million.\nCash capital expenditures which include the purchase of property, plant and equipment, and activity related to our flash joint ventures on the cash flow statement represented a cash outflow of $84 million. The quarter ending inventory was $3.2 billion, declining $281 million from the prior quarter. Days of inventory decreased 5 days to 115 days. The majority of the decline was in flash, where flash days of inventory remained at a 4-year low.\nDuring the quarter, we issued $1.6 billion in convertible notes, repurchased $508 million of the outstanding 2024 convertible notes and paid down $300 million of the delayed [ draw ] term loan. Gross debt outstanding was $8.5 billion at the end of the fiscal second quarter. We expect to retire the remaining balance of approximately $600 million of the 2024 convertible notes at maturity in February 2024.\nAt the end of the fiscal second quarter, cash and cash equivalents were $2.5 billion, and total liquidity was $4.7 billion, including the undrawn revolver capacity of $2.25 billion. For the fiscal third quarter, our non-GAAP guidance is as follows: we expect revenue to be in the range of $3.2 billion to $3.4 billion; we expect sequential revenue growth to be mainly driven by an increase in HDD; we anticipate flash revenue to be up slightly as we remain focused on optimizing bit shipments and ASP. We expect gross margin to be between 22% and 24%, which includes HDD underutilization charges of $30 million to $40 million. We expect operating expenses to be between $600 million and $620 million, with the increase driven by the reinstatement of certain incentive compensation programs as the financial outlook has strengthened. Interest and other expenses are expected to be approximately $95 million. We continue to expect income tax expenses to be between $20 million and $30 million for fiscal third quarter and $80 million to $120 million for fiscal year 2024. We expect the preferred dividend of $15 million. We expect earnings per share to be $0.05, plus or minus $0.15, based on approximately 330 million shares outstanding.\nAs the financial outlook has improved, we will remain disciplined in executing the business, proactively managing our supply and inventory to meet customer end demand and controlling capital spending, all with the goal of improving profitability. I'll now turn the call back over to David.\n\nDavid V. Goeckeler\n\nCEO & Director, Western Digital Corporation\n\nThanks, Wissam. Let me wrap up, and then we'll open up for questions. I want to emphasize that the steps the Western Digital team has taken to instill and deploy an industry-leading product portfolio, while also moving quickly to adapt to both volatile market dynamics and anticipate future trends, have enabled us to capitalize on the upswing we see ahead. Through our product leadership and ability to dampen business cycles and improve through-cycle profitability, I am confident we are well positioned to execute on our current strategy, which will reaffirm our strength over the long term. Let's now begin the Q&A."

Welcome to Western Digital's Fiscal Third Quarter 2022 Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Now I will turn the call over to Mr. Peter Andrew, Vice President, Financial Planning and Analysis and Investor Relations. You may begin.\n\nT. Peter Andrew\n\nVP of IR, Western Digital Corporation\n\nThank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me today are David Goeckeler, Chief Executive Officer; and Wissam Jabre, Chief Financial Officer.\nBefore we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements, including product portfolio expectations, business plans and performance, demand and market trends, and financial outlook based on management's current assumptions and expectations, and as such, does include risks and uncertainties. We assume no obligation to update these statements. Please refer to our most recent financial report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC for more information on the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.\nWe will also make references to non-GAAP financial measures today. Reconciliations between the non-GAAP and comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the press release and other materials that are being posted in the Investor Relations section of our website.\nWith that, I will now turn the call over to David for introductory remarks.\n\nDavid V. Goeckeler\n\nCEO & Director, Western Digital Corporation\n\nThank you, Peter. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the call to discuss our fiscal 2022 third quarter results. We delivered excellent performance in the quarter, with revenue of $4.4 billion and non-GAAP gross margin of 31.7%, both of which are at the higher end of our updated guidance ranges we provided in early March. Additionally, we reported non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.65, which exceeded our revised guidance. I am proud of the team's execution as we navigated dynamic geopolitical and macroeconomic environment as well as ongoing supply challenges. On top of that, we successfully managed through a fab contamination event that is now fully resolved.\nOverall, the Western Digital team did an amazing job of meeting our customers' growing and evolving storage needs. This has all been made possible by the operational and technological improvements we have made over the last couple of years that enable us to unlock the true earnings power of the Western Digital model.\nLooking ahead, we are optimistic about the business outlook for calendar year 2022. We believe the secular demand for storage in our new product ramps in HDD and Flash, combined with the seasonally stronger second half of the calendar year, will drive growth across our end markets.\nWith 40% of the world's data stored on Western Digital products, our innovation powers the global technology ecosystem from consumer devices to the edge to the heart of the cloud. Our vision is to create breakthrough innovation inspired by the convergence of human potential and digital transformation that enables the world to actualize its aspirations.\nAt Western Digital, we have established an admirable position in the large and growing storage markets. Our proven ability to develop a diversified portfolio of industry-leading products, coupled with our broad routes to market, puts Western Digital in a unique position to capitalize on the promising growth opportunities ahead of us.\nI'll now turn to an update on our HDD and Flash businesses.\nOur HDD revenue was as forecast and in line with typical March quarter seasonality, led by growth in capacity enterprise drives. Robust demand in the cloud end market for 18- and 20-terabyte drives generated a nearly 40% increase in nearline revenue from the same period last year. Of note, our 20-terabyte drive exabyte shipments approached high single-digit percentage of total capacity enterprise shipments.\nDuring the quarter, qualification of OptiNAND-based hard drives progressed as planned across multiple cloud and OEM customers. Combining OptiNAND with our SMR leadership uniquely positions Western Digital in the marketplace. Putting it all together, we have positioned our innovations in OptiNAND and SMR to drive business results in our capacity enterprise business for the rest of this calendar year and into the future. Our largest cloud customers are aligned with this strategy and are accelerating adoption of SMR products within data centers later this year. We are laser-focused on bringing new cutting-edge features and functions to our products for cloud storage. We will provide more details around these exciting innovations at our Investor Day on May 10.\nTurning to Flash. Our overall business was impacted by our ability to ship product due to the fab excursion. In light of this event, coupled with the supply chain challenges facing all companies across the industry, I would like to thank our customers and the Western Digital teams for working together diligently to mitigate the impact of supply chain disruptions. From a product perspective, client SSD demand improved in the quarter as our PC OEM customers successfully worked through their own supply chain issues.\nGaming is another growth market for us, where we continue to have success, with exabyte shipment nearly doubling year-over-year. We have a leading position in the marketplace with our brands, including WD_BLACK, SanDisk and SanDisk Professional, recognized globally for cutting-edge innovation, performance and quality. An example of this is our WD_BLACK SN-770 SSD product, which leverages our cutting-edge BiCS5 technology and in-house DRAM-less controller architecture. This SSD product is one of the fastest and best drives available in the market. We have received excellent reviews from tech journalists, which is a great testament to the company's strength in both our BiCS technology leadership and our ability to develop innovative solutions, enabling our customers to unlock the potential of their PCs.\nQualifications of BiCS5-based products for clients and consumer end markets were largely completed, and we are making great progress in qualifying our next-generation BiCS5 enterprise SSD products. We expect these products to drive revenue growth and mix improvements into the future. Lastly, BiCS5 represented nearly half of the Flash revenue, up from 41% in the previous quarter.\nLet me now offer a few observations on the demand environment. In cloud, we see continued strength in calendar year 2022. The increase in cloud capital investment for data center build-outs is expected to propel growth for our HDD and Flash products in this growing end market. In client, PC end demand growth has been solid for the last 2 years, and we are starting to see some normalization in the PC market. We expect PC unit demand to remain significantly above pre-pandemic levels, with the return-to-site trend driving a mix shift towards commercial and enterprise PCs with richer client SSD content versus consumer-oriented PCs.\nIn mobile, we have a strong position in 5G phones and we see demand for the latest 5G flagship phones remaining solid, with NAND content doubling from prior generation smartphones. In other emerging applications, demand from gaming and VR/AR devices remains robust. Industry analysts expect VR headset sales to grow at a 47% CAGR over the next couple of years.\nIn consumer, we are experiencing short-term demand weakness outside the U.S. tied to the geopolitical events in Europe, as well as COVID-related lockdowns in China. However, we are confident in the strength of the business as we are entering a seasonally stronger second half of the calendar year with a number of new innovative products.\nWe feel good about the overall demand in calendar year 2022. We are continuing to navigate the macroeconomic and geopolitical factors I mentioned earlier. While these transitory issues are affecting both revenue and gross margin in the near term, we expect them to subside over time. We are confident that the growth and profitability opportunities in front of us have not changed.\nIn closing, I want to acknowledge the hard work and unrelenting spirit of our employees that goes into creating our game-changing products. In particular, I want to thank our employees in China for their efforts to work through all the supply chain and logistics challenges during the lockdowns.\nBefore turning the call over to Wissam, I wanted to make a quick announcement that Western Digital and the IRS have reached a tentative agreement to resolve a long-running tax matter, covering the fiscal years 2008 through 2015. With offsetting tax benefits, we expect the ultimate net amount will be in the range of $500 million to $600 million. While this settlement will result in a previously unforecasted cash payment in fiscal year 2023, it does highlight the work that I and the rest of the Western Digital team have undertaken in the last 2 years to instill strong financial discipline and provide greater financial flexibility upon which we are building a foundation for future growth for the company. Wissam will go into more detail in a minute.\nLet me now turn the call over to Wissam, who will discuss our fiscal third quarter results and provide a more detailed outlook for the fiscal fourth quarter. Wissam?\n\nWissam Jabre\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Western Digital Corporation\n\nThanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. As David mentioned, overall results for the fiscal third quarter were better than our revised expectations. Despite the incredibly dynamic macro environment that David discussed, our results reflected the resilience of our business and our ability to continually deliver solid financial performance. In addition, we completed a debt restructuring with our lenders in the March quarter, marking continued success in paying down debt and providing increased financial flexibility and stability.\nTotal revenue for the quarter was $4.4 billion, down 9% sequentially and up 6% year-over-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.65, above the revised guidance range of $1.30 to $1.60 we provided in early March. We are pleased to have delivered such strong results in the face of the challenging environment.\nTurning to our end markets. Cloud represented 40% of total revenue at $1.8 billion, down 8% sequentially and up 25% from a year ago. Within cloud, Western Digital's leadership position at the 18-terabyte capacity point and ramp of 20-terabyte drives drove a nearly 40% year-over-year increase in nearline revenue. This growth was partially offset by lower enterprise SSD and smart video hard drive revenues.\nThe client end market represented 40% of total revenue at $1.7 billion, down 7% sequentially and 2% year-over-year. The sequential decrease was primarily due to typical seasonality in both Flash for mobile and client hard drives. On a year-over-year basis, growth in Flash was offset by a decline in hard drive. Lastly, consumer represented 20% of revenue at $0.9 billion, down 17% sequentially and 8% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, the decline was primarily due to lower retail Flash shipments. The year-over-year decrease was roughly evenly split between hard drive and Flash products.\nTurning now to revenue by segment. We reported flash revenue of $2.2 billion, down 14% sequentially and up 3% year-over-year. On a blended basis, Flash ASPs were down 1% sequentially. On a like-for-like basis, Flash ASPs were down 2% sequentially. Flash bit shipments decreased 14% sequentially and increased 9% year-over-year. During the quarter, we recognized the majority of the bit supply impact caused by the fab contamination.\nHard drive revenue was $2.1 billion, down 3% sequentially and up 9% year-over-year. Sequentially, total hard drive exabyte shipments increased 1%, while the average price per hard drive increased by 4% to $101. On a year-over-year basis, total hard drive exabyte shipments and average price per hard drive increased by 20% and 22%, respectively.\nAs we move to costs and expenses, my comments will be related to non-GAAP results unless stated otherwise. In the March quarter, total fab contamination charges of $203 million were excluded from our non-GAAP results. Gross margin for the third quarter was 31.7%, down 190 basis points sequentially and up 400 basis points year-over-year, including approximately $59 million in COVID-related expenses. Our flash gross margin was 35.6%, down 50 basis points sequentially and up 560 basis points year-over-year.\nOur hard drive gross margin was 27.7%, down 290 basis points sequentially and up 270 basis points year-over-year. Hard drive gross margin included coverage-related impact of approximately $51 million or 240 basis points.\nOperating expenses of $740 million were below our guidance range as we tightly managed our expenses. Operating income was $650 million, representing a 26% decrease from the prior quarter and a 58% increase year-over-year. Earnings per share was $1.65, up from $1.02 in the year-ago quarter. Operating cash flow for the third quarter was $398 million, and free cash flow was $148 million.\nCash and capital expenditures, which include the purchase of property, plant and equipment, and activity related to our Flash joint ventures on our cash flow statement represented a cash outflow of $250 million. We remain disciplined in investing in manufacturing capacity and expect gross CapEx for the current fiscal year to be around $2.9 billion. We expect cash CapEx to be around $1.3 billion as we actively manage our overall spending.\nIn the fiscal third quarter, we made a discretionary debt repayment of $150 million. Our gross debt outstanding was $7.25 billion at the end of the fiscal quarter. We ended the quarter with $2.51 billion of total cash and cash equivalents. Our trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA at the end of the third quarter, as defined in our credit agreement, was $5 billion, resulting in a gross leverage ratio of 1.4x compared to 2.6x a year ago. As a reminder, our credit agreement includes $1 billion in depreciation add-back associated with the Flash ventures. This is not reflected in our cash flow statement. Please refer to our earnings presentation on the Investor Relations website for further details.\nBefore discussing our outlook, I wanted to provide some more details on the settlement with the IRS that David mentioned. As previously disclosed in our quarterly SEC filings, the company has been in a significant long-running situation with the IRS regarding taxes owed for fiscal years 2008 through 2015. As you can see in our GAAP statements, we took a tax charge in the fiscal third quarter, primarily based on our latest assessment of the situation.\nIn the last few days, we reached a tentative agreement to settle the transfer pricing issues in dispute. The actual amount to Western Digital will have to pay and exact timing of the payments have not been determined yet. However, we currently expect to make a cash payment in the range of $600 million to $700 million some time in the first half of fiscal 2023. Please note that this is the cash out number. We currently expect that the ultimate net amount will be in the range of $500 million to $600 million after accounting for certain offsetting tax benefits expected to be recouped over the next 3 years. Finally, in the fourth quarter, we will make a GAAP-only adjustment to the reserve associated with this settlement. You will find additional details in our 10-Q, which we plan to file next week.\nI'll now provide our view of both hard drive and Flash businesses for the fiscal fourth quarter. As we indicated on our last earnings call, we continue to expect hard drive revenue to increase driven by growth in nearline hard drives. We also expect Flash revenue to increase sequentially in the fourth fiscal quarter as our Flash supply improves. For our fiscal fourth quarter, our non-GAAP guidance is as follows:\nWe expect revenue to be in the range of $4.5 billion to $4.7 billion with sequential revenue growth for both hard drive and flash businesses; we expect gross margin to be between 31% and 33%; we expect operating expenses to be between $770 million and $790 million; interest and other expenses are expected to be approximately $70 million; our tax rate is expected to be approximately 11% in the fourth quarter; we expect earnings per share to be between $1.60 and $1.90 in the fourth quarter, assuming approximately 317 million fully diluted shares outstanding.\nI'll now turn the call back over to David.\n\nDavid V. Goeckeler\n\nCEO & Director, Western Digital Corporation\n\nThanks, Wissam. Looking ahead, we remain optimistic about our business outlook for the calendar year as customer demand across our end markets continues to be generally strong. Despite the supply chain challenges and macroeconomic factors we discussed earlier, it is evident that we have the right foundation for long-term growth, the right technology portfolio in place to meet evolving customer needs and the broad routes to market necessary to scale our business.\nOver the last couple of years, we have planned and executed significant changes to improve our focus, sharpen execution and set strategic goals to place Western Digital in a position of greater strength. And I'm excited that we are witnessing the positive impacts of those changes.\nBefore I wrap up, I want to remind everyone, we have an Investor Day coming up on May 10, and I look forward to seeing you all there. Let's start the Q&A."

(Operator Instructions) Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Peter Andrew. Please go ahead.\n\nT. Peter Andrew\n\nVP of IR, Western Digital Corporation\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. Joining me today are David Goeckeler, Chief Executive Officer; and Wissam Jabre, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements, including product portfolio expectations, business plans and performance, demand and market trends, and financial outlook based on management's current assumptions and expectations, and as such, does include risks and uncertainties.\nWe assume no obligation to update these statements.

Reconciliations between the non-GAAP and comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the press release and other materials that are being posted in the Investor Relations section of our website. With that, I'll now turn the call over to David for introductory remarks.\n\nDavid V. Goeckeler\n\nCEO & Director, Western Digital Corporation\n\nThank you, Peter. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call to discuss our 2023 first quarter results.\nI am pleased to see the Western Digital team work together to deliver revenue at the upper half of the guidance range in the midst of an incredibly dynamic and challenging macroeconomic environment. We reported first quarter revenue of $3.7 billion and non-GAAP operating income of $307 million. Our operating income performance was above the midpoint implied by our guidance and demonstrated our ability to actively respond and navigate this environment.\nOur non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.20 and included an approximately $0.30 impact due to higher-than-forecasted tax rate. Overall, the actions we have taken over the past few years are enabling us to manage through business cycle troughs more effectively and position the company to thrive as market conditions improve. These efforts have reinvigorated the Western Digital innovation engine and strengthened our product portfolio.\nIn particular, we are leading the transition to SMR-based hard drives alongside our cloud customers, showcasing our product leadership. In flash, we have nearly tripled our bit shipments in the NVMe enterprise SSD product category as compared to the last down cycle, adding another large and growing end market in which we can allocate our flash bits. Our industry-leading innovation, diversified portfolio and broad go-to-market strategy across cloud, client and consumer end markets allow us to enjoy strong relationships with our customers and meet the full range of storage needs.\nThe breadth of markets we address also offers us unique visibility into end market demand signals which allowed us to recognize potential challenges to our business as they unfolded. We have proactively and effectively managed our business through weakening consumer demand by optimizing product mix and rightsizing our hard drive manufacturing footprint.\nAs part of these efforts to manage through this part of the cycle, we are reducing our capital investments and operating expenses as we move to align our cash flow and cost structure with market conditions. Wissam will go over our efforts in more detail.\nAs we closely monitor the macro environment, we are encouraged to see retail flash and channel demand leveling out and orders from PC customers stabilizing, a sign that consumer-led inventory correction is abating. We believe the long-term growth in flash demand, combined with reduced flash industry supply will restore supply and demand balance in the next couple of quarters.\nBefore I jump into updates on our HD and Flash businesses, I want to provide a short update on our strategic review process. The executive committee of our Board, which I lead, continues its process, which I previously announced includes the participation of Elliott Management under a nondisclosure agreement. Given the ongoing nature and confidentiality of the process, we will not be answering any questions about the strategic review today. We will provide updates as we have them.\nNow turning to our HDD business. During the first quarter, our HDD revenue declined modestly as we had forecasted in August. Sequentially, total HDD and nearline exabyte shipments were both flat. Continued momentum with U.S. cloud customers and accelerated adoption of SMR hard drives were offset by softness in other capacity enterprise product channels and consumer HDD demand. Shipment of capacity enterprise drives based on SMR technologies exceeded 25% of this category, 1 quarter ahead of our expectations. We now expect SMR to represent over 40% of our capacity enterprise exabyte shipment exiting fiscal year 2023.\nSMR adoption drove a 19% sequential and 21% year-over-year increase in average capacity to 17 terabytes per capacity enterprise drive, and our 20-terabyte drive exabyte shipments increased more than 150% sequentially. We are deep into the process of qualifying our latest generation of hard drives, including our 26-terabyte UltraSMR hard drives at multiple U.S. cloud and OEM customers. Interest in SMR from other hyperscalers worldwide is increasing as the 20% capacity gain offers multi-generation TCO benefits to the most complex data centers worldwide.\nLooking ahead, our U.S. cloud customers have started sharply reducing their hard drive inventory alongside other components for their data center build-outs. This, along with continued subdued demand across markets in China, will impact near-term demand over the next few quarters. Despite these near-term corrections, it is clear from our conversations with these customers that HDD products will be the foundational storage for their continued cloud build-out in the years to come.\nOur product leadership and innovation engine remain as strong as ever, and we are confident that Western Digital's hard drive business will thrive over the long term as demand improves and new products continue to ramp.\nTurning to Flash. Revenue was slightly ahead of our expectations. Thanks to our broad portfolio, diverse routes to market and leading brands, including WD Black, SanDisk and SanDisk Professional that are recognized globally for their cutting-edge innovation, performance and quality. I'm pleased to say that we exceeded our bit shipment forecast this quarter.\nOur client SSD products for PC OEM, retail and mobile drove the upside in bit shipments. Average capacity per client SSD increased 24% sequentially and 54% year-over-year, driven by doubling of standard storage capacity for PCs sold by multiple OEMs. This is another reminder of the insatiable demand for data storage and the resilience of flash demand as price elasticity drives increased consumption per device.\nOn the technology front, BiCS5 accelerated to over 2/3 of our Flash revenue in the September quarter, up from about half in the previous quarter. BiCS6 yield and development of subsequent 3D-NAND Flash are both progressing well. For the December quarter, we expect Flash shipments to increase sequentially, led by seasonal strength in retail and mobile. With the abrupt change in market conditions, we are acting decisively to adjust our supply trajectory to align with demand.\nWe are pushing out BiCS6 transition to meaningfully reduce our capital expenditures for fiscal year 2023 which may offer us a potential opportunity to leapfrog to a future BiCS technology node as demand normalizes. With that, let me now turn the call over to Wissam, who will discuss our first quarter results in greater detail and provide an outlook for the second quarter.\n\nWissam G. Jabre\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Western Digital Corporation\n\nThank you, David, and good morning, everyone. As David mentioned, revenue was in line, thanks to our team's agility and resilience in managing through this dynamic environment. Total revenue for the quarter was $3.7 billion, down 17% sequentially and 26% year-over-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.20. And as David mentioned, included an approximately $0.30 impact due to the higher than forecasted tax rate. Looking at our end markets, cloud represented 49% of revenue at $1.8 billion, down 13% sequentially and 18% year-over-year. Compared to the prior quarter, continued momentum in capacity enterprise drives sold to U.S. cloud customers and an increase in smart video hard drives demand partly offset the decline in all other hard drive product channels and flash.\nSequentially, nearline bit shipments were flat at 112 exabytes, driven by our success in leading the industry transition to SMR hard drives. The year-over-year decrease was due to broad-based decline across both hard drive and flash products. Clients represented 33% of total revenue at $1.2 billion, down 25% sequentially and 34% year-over-year.\nSequentially, the decline was attributed to flash driven by inventory reduction at PC OEMs and lower pricing. The year-over-year decline resulted primarily from the reduced flash pricing. Lastly, consumer represented 18% of revenue at $0.7 billion, down 15% sequentially and 30% year-over-year. On both a sequential and year-over-year basis, the revenue decline was due to flash pricing and lower retail HDD shipments.\nTurning now to revenue by segment. We reported HDD revenue of $2 billion, down 5% sequentially and 21% year-over-year. Compared to the prior quarter, total HDD exabyte shipments increased by 1% and average price per hard drive increased by 4% to $125. On a year-over-year basis, total HDD exabyte shipments decreased by 12% and average price per unit increased by 23%.\nFlash revenue was $1.7 billion, down 28% sequentially and 31% year-over-year. Sequentially, Flash ASPs were down 22% on a blended basis and 17% on a like-for-like basis. Flash bit shipments decreased 10% sequentially and 7% year-over-year.\nAs we move to costs and expenses, please note that my comments will be related to non-GAAP results unless stated otherwise. Gross margin for the fiscal first quarter was 26.7%, down 5.6 percentage points sequentially and 7.2 percentage points year-over-year. Our HDD gross margin was 28.5%, up 30 basis points sequentially and down 2.4 percentage points year-over-year. Our Flash gross margin was 24.5%, down 11.4 percentage points sequentially and 12.5 percentage points year-over-year.\nOperating expenses were $689 million, down $71 million sequentially and below our guidance range due to lower variable expenses and tighter expense management, including reduction of discretionary spending. Operating income was $307 million, representing a 56% decrease from the prior quarter and a 68% decrease year-over-year. As David mentioned, we are pleased to have delivered operating income above the midpoint implied by our guidance in a challenging market backdrop.\nOur tax expense was $168 million, resulting in a tax rate of 72% higher than previously forecasted. Tax expense is influenced by several factors, including the projected quarterly profitability for the rest of the year and our corporate tax structure. Earnings per share was $0.20 compared to $1.78 in the prior quarter and $2.49 in the year-ago quarter.\nOperating cash flow for the first quarter was $6 million, and free cash flow was an outflow of $215 million. Cash capital expenditures, which includes the purchase of property, plant, equipment, and activity related to our flash joint ventures on our cash flow statement represented a cash outflow of $221 million. Our gross debt outstanding remained at $7.1 billion at the end of the fiscal first quarter.\nOur liquidity position continues to be strong. At the end of the quarter, we had $2 billion of cash and cash equivalents and revolver capacity of $2.25 billion. Our trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA at the end of the first quarter, as defined in our credit agreement was $4.1 billion, resulting in a gross leverage ratio of 1.7x compared to 2x a year ago.\nAs a reminder, our credit agreement includes $0.9 billion in depreciation add-back associated with the flash ventures. This is not reflected in the cash flow statement. Please refer to the earnings presentation on the Investor Relations website for further details.\nBefore I go over guidance for the fiscal second quarter, I would like to discuss the business outlook for the balance of this fiscal year and the actions we are taking to align our execution plan with the changes in business environment. In Flash, we expect shipments to increase sequentially in the fiscal second quarter and the balance of the fiscal year 2023 as the market stabilizes. In HDD, we expect our revenue to recover as our U.S. cloud customers reduce their inventories over the next 2 quarters.\nOn the manufacturing front, we have sharply reduced client hard drive production capacity by approximately 40%. For the fiscal year 2023, we are reducing our gross capital expenditures to $2.7 billion. We are also aiming to reduce our cash capital expenditure by 20% versus our prior expectation. The main drivers of our lower capital expenditures are primarily the push out of BiCS6 transition in Flash and reduced investments in hard drive manufacturing.\nAs for our operating expenses, we proactively reduced our spending by approximately $80 million in the first fiscal quarter relative to the midpoint of the guidance range. We are also taking further action to lower our ongoing operating expenses range to $650 million to $700 million as we navigate this dynamic environment. We believe these actions we are taking will allow us to continue to invest in innovation as a top priority for our company going forward.\nFor the fiscal second quarter, our non-GAAP guidance is as follows: we expect revenue to be in the range of $2.9 billion to $3.1 billion. We expect gross margin to be between 20% and 22%. We expect operating expenses to be between $650 million and $670 million. Interest and other expenses are expected to be approximately $80 million. We expect the tax benefit between $70 million and $90 million. We expect loss per share of $0.25 to earnings per share of $0.05 in the second quarter, assuming approximately 319 million fully diluted shares outstanding. I'll now turn the call back over to David.\n\nDavid V. Goeckeler\n\nCEO & Director, Western Digital Corporation\n\nThanks, Wissam. Let me briefly wrap up, and then we'll open up for questions. While near-term market conditions are challenging, digital transformation continues to drive long-term growth for data storage from client to edge to cloud. With products and solutions that play in every part of the technology ecosystem, Western Digital can meet customers' needs across the spectrum and unlock the possibilities of data.\nFor example, while we are successfully managing through the consumer-led downturn, which is showing signs of stabilization, we are ramping multiple new products into data centers worldwide. As we remain focused on innovation and execution, I am optimistic that Western Digital will emerge stronger as we continue to ramp multiple new products into data centers worldwide and market conditions improve. With our top-tier team innovative and diversified portfolio, broad customer base and differentiated go-to-market engine, we are uniquely positioned to capture the opportunities stemming from the rapid global adoption of the cloud and the expansive and growing ecosystem it supports.\nFinally, I want to thank our employees for their hard work during this quarter and for solidifying our leadership in storage. In the face of an extremely challenging macro environment, our team worked together to deliver solid financial performance for Western Digital. I am proud of what this team has accomplished and excited to see what we can do together in calendar 2023 and beyond.\nAll right, Peter. With that, let's open it up for Q&A."

Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides.\n\nOperator\n\nYour line is live.\n\nAndy Taylor\n\nThank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss Weyerhaeuser's Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. Our earnings release and presentation materials can also be found on our website. Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements as forward-looking statements will be made during the conference call.\nWe will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, and a reconciliation of GAAP can be found in the earnings materials on our website.\nOn the call this morning are Devin Stockfish, Chief Executive Officer; and Nancy Loewe, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Devin Stockfish.\n\nDevin W. Stockfish\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Weyerhaeuser Company\n\nThanks, Andy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. This morning, Weyerhaeuser reported full year GAAP earnings of $2.6 billion or $3.47 per diluted share on net sales of $10.2 billion. Excluding special items, our full year 2021 earnings totaled $2.5 billion or $3.37 per diluted share. Adjusted EBITDA was a record $4.1 billion, more than 86% increase over full year 2020.\nFor the fourth quarter, we reported GAAP earnings of $416 million, or $0.55 per diluted share on net sales of $2.2 billion. Excluding a total after-tax benefit of $49 million for special items, we earned $367 million or $0.49 per diluted share for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $674 million.\nI'll start this morning by thanking our employees for an exceptional year. Through their collective efforts, Weyerhaeuser delivered its strongest financial performance on record. Each of our businesses executed remarkably well. The team has maintained a safety focus and continue to serve our customers, all while navigating persistent operational and market challenges. I'm extremely proud of our accomplishments in 2021, which further positioned the company to drive superior long-term value for our shareholders.\nNotable 2021 highlights include delivering record adjusted EBITDA from our Wood Products business of $3.4 billion, a 120% increase over 2020, capturing more than $70 million of company-wide operational excellence improvements, optimizing our timberlands holdings through strategic transactions in Alabama and Washington, launching our Natural Climate Solutions business with a growth target to achieve $100 million of annual EBITDA by year-end 2025, publishing the company's inaugural peer-leading carbon record, establishing a leadership position amongst our North American peers in setting a science-based greenhouse gas reduction target, strengthening our balance sheet by paying down an additional $375 million of debt and increasing our share repurchase authorization to $1 billion.\nIn addition, as highlighted on Page 19 of our earnings slide, we generated more than $2.6 billion of adjusted FAD in 2021, further demonstrating the strong cash generation capability of our unmatched portfolio of assets and industry-leading operating performance.\nBased on our 2021 results, we announced this morning that our Board of Directors has declared a supplemental cash dividend of $1.45 per share payable on February 28 to holders of record on February 18. This supplemental dividend represents the final installment of our cash return to shareholders based on 2021 results.\nWhen combined with our 2021 quarterly base dividend of $0.68 per share and the onetime interim supplemental dividend of $0.50 per share that was paid in October, we are returning a total of $2.63 per share of dividends to shareholders based on 2021 results, which equates to a 75% of 2021 adjusted FAD.\nIncluding the $100 million of shares repurchased in 2021, Weyerhaeuser is returning more than $2 billion of total cash to shareholders based on 2021 results or 79% of 2021 adjusted FAD, which is at the upper end of our commitment of returning 75% to 80% of FAD on an annual basis.\nMoving forward in 2022, we remain committed to returning a significant amount of cash to shareholders. This will continue to be supported by our sustainable quarterly base dividend which, as previously announced, we intend to grow by 5% annually through 2025. As outlined in our cash return framework on Page 18, we will supplement our base dividend with an additional return of cash, as appropriate, to achieve our targeted annual payout of 75% to 80%. As demonstrated in 2021, we have the flexibility in our framework to return this additional cash in the form of a supplemental cash dividend or a combination of a supplemental dividend and opportunistic share repurchase. We continue to believe this flexible and sustainable cash return framework will enhance our ability to drive long-term shareholder value by returning meaningful and appropriate amounts of cash back to our shareholders across a variety of market conditions.\nTurning now to our fourth quarter business results. I'll begin the discussion with Timberlands, on Pages 7 through 10 of our earnings slides.\nTimberlands contributed $110 million to fourth quarter earnings. Adjusted EBITDA increased by $11 million compared to the third quarter.\nFor the full year, Timberlands' adjusted EBITDA increased by 14% compared to 2020. These strong results were delivered despite persistent weather-, transportation- and pandemic-related challenges in 2021, and I would like to specifically recognize our Western Timberlands team for their exceptional work managing through the salvage operations resulting from the 2020 Oregon fires. As of year-end, we've completed substantially all of the planned salvage harvest.\nIn the West, adjusted EBITDA increased by $3 million compared to the third quarter. Western domestic log market showed signs of improvement at the outset of the fourth quarter following a brief softening in demand in September. As the fourth quarter progressed, log demand further improved as mills sought to capitalize on rapidly increasing lumber prices. While log supply in the Western system was sufficient as the quarter began, it became constrained later in the quarter, particularly in Oregon, as a result of supply chain disruptions and adverse weather conditions. Despite this dynamic, our fee harvest volumes increased slightly compared to the third quarter.\nWith lower log inventories and limited regional log supply as the quarter progressed, we increased the volume of fee logs to our internal mills, resulting in modestly lower third-party domestic sales volumes compared to the third quarter. This is a great example of how we leverage our integrated business model to effectively navigate and capitalize on temporary market disruptions.\nOur average sales realizations in the West were comparable to the third quarter but increased each month and ended the year at their highest levels of 2021. Per unit log and haul costs decreased in the fourth quarter, as did forestry and road costs.\nTurning to our export markets. In Japan, demand for our logs remained strong in the fourth quarter as persistent global supply chain disruptions, a shortage of shipping containers and strengthening U.S. domestic lumber markets reduced the availability of imported lumber into Japan. This dynamic continued to drive solid demand for locally produced Japanese lumber and for our imported logs to support that domestic production. As a result, our Japanese log realizations in the fourth quarter increased slightly compared to the third quarter. Sales volumes were modestly lower due to timing of vessels.\nIn China, end-market demand for our Western logs remained favorable in the quarter despite lower-than-expected overall Chinese consumption and elevated log inventories at the ports. Imports of lumber and logs into China continue to be impacted by global shipping container availability and the ban on Australian logs. As a result, our sales volumes to China increased significantly compared to the third quarter. Sales realizations for our China export logs decreased slightly and ocean freight rates improved during the quarter.\nMoving to the South. Southern Timberlands adjusted EBITDA increased by $4 million compared to the third quarter. Southern sawlog and fiber markets continued to strengthen in the fourth quarter despite ample log supply resulting from dryer weather conditions. Mill inventories returned to normal levels in most geographies during the quarter, but log demand remained strong across the south as mills sought to capitalize on rising lumber and panel pricing and focused on bolstering log inventories heading into the first quarter. As a result of these dynamics, our sales realizations increased slightly compared to the third quarter and fee harvest volumes were modestly higher. Per unit log and haul costs increased slightly in the quarter, primarily for transportation costs.\nTurning now to Southern export, which remains a small component of our overall operations. During the fourth quarter, Chinese regulators implemented new rules for imported pine logs to address potential phytosanitary concerns. These regulations imposed additional costs and administrative requirements. As a result, we paused our Southern pine log exports to China. And consequently, our export log volumes to China decreased significantly compared to the third quarter. In response, we redirected logs to domestic mills and significantly increased our export log volumes to India in the fourth quarter. We are optimistic that this headwind for pine exports to China will be transitory and still maintain a constructive, longer-term outlook for our Southern export business.\nIn the North, adjusted EBITDA increased by $2 million compared to the third quarter. Fee harvest volumes were significantly higher, resulting from favorable weather conditions and robust log demand as mills built inventory. Sales realizations increased slightly primarily for hardwood logs.\nTurning to Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources on Pages 11 and 12. Real estate and ENR contributed $36 million to fourth quarter earnings and $49 million to adjusted EBITDA. Fourth quarter EBITDA was $11 million lower than the third quarter due to the timing of transactions. Similar to 2020, our real estate activity in 2021 was heavily weighted toward the first half of the year.\nFor the full year, the segment generated $296 million of adjusted EBITDA, slightly higher than our revised full year guidance and 23% higher than 2020. Despite a year-over-year reduction in acres sold, full year earnings increased by 144% compared to 2020 due to the mix of properties sold. And average sales prices increased by more than $2,000 per acre, a 120% increase. These results underscore the strength of the HBU market in 2021, the quality of our properties and our team's ability to capitalize on these strong markets to deliver significant premiums to timber values.\nNow I'll make a few comments on our Natural Climate Solutions business which we launched in 2021. As shown on Page 22, full year adjusted EBITDA from this business increased by 73% compared to 2020, driven primarily by growth from existing businesses in our portfolio, including mitigation and conservation as well as renewable energy. Additionally, we continue to make progress on our forest carbon pilot project in Maine and we continue to look to seek approval in 2022. We're also advancing discussions with high-quality developers of solar, wind and carbon capture and storage projects across our ownership. We continue to see multiyear growth potential from these businesses and maintain our target of reaching $100 million of annual EBITDA by the end of 2025.\nMoving to Wood Products, Pages 13 through 15. Wood Products contributed $466 million to fourth quarter earnings before special items and $517 million to adjusted EBITDA. Our EWP business established a new quarterly adjusted EBITDA record in the quarter, surpassing the prior record established just last quarter by 50%.\nFor the full year, our lumber, OSB and EWP businesses established new annual EBITDA records, and our distribution business generated the highest annual adjusted EBITDA in over 15 years. This is all notwithstanding ongoing challenges resulting from supply chain-, transportation-, weather- and pandemic-related disruptions. This is truly exceptional performance, and I'm extremely proud of the resiliency, flexibility and determination exhibited by our teams as they navigated multiple headwinds in 2021.\nIn the fourth quarter, demand remained unseasonably strong across our Wood Products businesses, driven by continued strength in new residential home building and repair and remodel activity as well as favorable weather conditions for construction for the majority of the quarter.\nStarting with the lumber and OSB markets. Benchmark lumber prices entered the quarter on an upward trajectory driven by strong home building and repair and remodel demand. In contrast, OSB markets remained fairly balanced for the first 2 months of the quarter, resulting in relatively flat composite pricing. Both lumber and OSB pricing increased at a rapid pace starting in December as supply was disrupted by a myriad of factors, including major flooding in British Columbia that disrupted transportation and supply chain networks across Western Canada; labor challenges exacerbated by the Omicron variant, which impacted industry-wide mill operations, log supply and transportation carriers; and significant weather events that further impacted transportation and log supply in the Northwest and Canada in December. Channel inventories of both lumber and OSB ended the year in a lean position with continued strong demand.\nAdjusted EBITDA for our lumber business increased by $77 million compared to the third quarter. Our average sales realizations increased by 15% in the fourth quarter, while the framing lumber composite pricing increased by 40%. This relative difference was largely a result of extended order files that lagged surging lumber prices and shipping delays due to transportation disruptions.\nOur sales volumes decreased significantly in the fourth quarter, resulting from weather-related transportation challenges in Canada and lower inventory drawdown compared to the third quarter. Production volumes were modestly lower and unit manufacturing costs were moderately higher, resulting from weather-related events in the Northwest and Canada, including 1 week of downtime at our Princeton mill following the flooding event in British Columbia.\nAdjusted EBITDA for our OSB business decreased by $168 million compared to the third quarter. Despite a rapid increase in pricing in December, our average sales realizations decreased by 29% in the fourth quarter, while the OSB composite pricing decreased by 20%. Similar to lumber, this relative difference was largely a result of extended order files that lagged surging OSB prices and shipping delays due to transportation disruptions.\nOur sales volumes decreased slightly compared to the third quarter, resulting from weather-related transportation challenges in Canada. Production volumes and unit manufacturing costs improved in the quarter due to less downtime for planned maintenance. Fiber costs were moderately higher in the quarter.\nEngineered Wood Products adjusted EBITDA increased by $38 million compared to the third quarter, a 50% improvement. Raw material costs were significantly lower, primarily for OSB web stock. Sales realizations improved for most products, and we continue to benefit from previously price increases for solid section and I-joists. Sales and production volumes were lower for most products as a result of planned annual maintenance during the quarter and the impacts of COVID-related staffing shortages.\nIn Distribution, adjusted EBITDA increased by $18 million compared to the third quarter, an 82% improvement as the business captured improved margins, primarily for lumber and OSB, partially offset by seasonally lower sales volumes.\nI'd like to now turn to operational excellence. In 2021, our teams captured more than $70 million of margin improvements, meeting our $50 million to $75 million target, while also making meaningful progress against our other OpEx priorities, including with respect to creation, cost avoidance, driving efficiencies and cross-business synergies throughout the company. This was a remarkable accomplishment when considering the numerous challenges facing our business in 2021. Once again, our people demonstrated unwavering focus and exceptional teamwork to deliver innovative and creative solutions to overcome obstacles and drive OpEx across the company.\nIn addition, I'm pleased with how well our employees continue to drive cross-business OpEx that improved margins in both Timberlands and Wood Products. These efforts optimized internal log deliveries to Weyerhaeuser mills to maximize value and avoid out-of-log downtime. And our teams worked together across our businesses to ensure that we maximize the recovery value from our salvage operations in Oregon.\nAs we look forward to the future, we're targeting another $175 million to $250 million of OpEx improvements across our businesses between 2022 and 2025. And I look forward to sharing more about our key initiatives and results in the years ahead.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Nancy to discuss some financial items in our first quarter and 2022 outlook.\n\nNancy S. Loewe\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Weyerhaeuser Company\n\nThank you, Devin, and good morning, everyone. I'll be covering key financial items, the fourth quarter financial performance before moving into our first quarter and full year 2022 outlook.\nI'll begin with key financial items, which are summarized on Page 17. We generated $494 million of cash from operations in the fourth quarter, bringing our total for the year to approximately $3.2 billion, our highest full year operating cash flow on record. As Devin mentioned, we're returning over $2 billion to shareholders based on 2021 results, which includes $100 million of share repurchases.\nFourth quarter share repurchase activity totaled $74 million at an average price of $37.60. This leaves us with approximately $926 million of the remaining capacity as of year-end 2021 under the $1 billion program we announced in the third quarter. We will continue to leverage our flexible cash return framework and look to repurchase shares opportunistically when we believe it will create shareholder value.\nTurning to the balance sheet. We ended the year with approximately $1.9 billion of cash and cash equivalents, of which nearly $1.1 billion is earmarked for the supplemental dividend we announced this morning that will be paid in February. We ended the year with total gross debt of $5.1 billion. At the beginning of the fourth quarter, we repaid our $150 million 9% note at maturity, and we have no additional maturities until 2023.\nFourth quarter results for our unallocated items are summarized on Page 16. Fourth quarter unallocated adjusted EBITDA decreased by $24 million compared to the third quarter. This decline was primarily attributable to higher-than-expected health care expenses, partially due to pandemic-related deferrals of nonessential medical treatment from 2020 into 2021.\nKey outlook items for the first quarter and full year 2022 are presented now on Pages 20 and 21. In our Timberlands business, we expect first quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be significantly higher than the fourth quarter.\nBeginning with our Western Timberlands operations, domestic log demand continues to be favorable as mills capitalize on strong lumber pricing. We anticipate this dynamic continuing for most of the first quarter. As a result, our average domestic sales realizations are expected to be significantly higher than the fourth quarter.\nAs Devin discussed, we have substantially completed our salvage harvest operations in Oregon. In addition, we have made the seasonal transition to lower elevation and lower-cost harvest operations. As a result, we expect our first quarter fee harvest volumes will be significantly higher than the fourth quarter, with lower per unit log and haul costs and seasonally lower forestry and road costs.\nMoving to the export markets. In Japan, log demand remains favorable, and we anticipate our first quarter sales realizations will be moderately higher than the fourth quarter with comparable sales volumes.\nIn China, despite elevated log inventories at the ports, demand for our logs is expected to remain favorable in the first quarter as imports of lumber and logs from other markets continue to be constrained. We expect our first quarter sales volumes to be comparable to the fourth quarter, partially offset by slightly lower sales realizations.\nIn the South, despite log inventories near target levels, log demand continues to be strong as mills position to benefit from strong lumber and panel pricing and build inventory to avoid potential disruptions from wet weather conditions that are typical in the first quarter. We anticipate comparable sales realizations and seasonally lower forestry and road costs. This is expected to be offset by slightly higher per unit log and haul costs and slightly lower fee harvest volumes due to seasonal wet weather patterns.\nIn the North, sales realizations are expected to be slightly lower in the first quarter due to mix, with slightly lower fee harvest volumes resulting from a seasonal reduction in harvest activity.\nTurning to our full year harvest plan. For the full year 2022, we expect total company fee harvest volume to increase to approximately 34.5 million tons.\nIn the West, we anticipate our harvest volumes will be slightly higher than 2021 as salvage harvest operations in Oregon are substantially complete.\nWe expect our Southern harvest volumes to increase moderately as we resume a more normalized level of activity following reduced harvest levels in 2021 resulting from persistent adverse weather conditions.\nSimilar to 2021, we expect our Northern harvest volumes will be moderately lower year-over-year due to softening fiber markets in New England.\nTurning to our Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources segment. Demand for our real estate properties remains strong, and we continue to expect a consistent flow of transactions with significant premiums to timber value. We expect full year 2022 adjusted EBITDA of approximately $300 million for this segment.\nSimilar to 2021, we anticipate our real estate activity will be heavily weighted towards the first half of the year. Basis as a percentage of real estate sales is expected to be approximately 35% to 45% for the year. First quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA are expected to be slightly higher than the first quarter of 2021 due to an increase in real estate acres sold.\nFor our Wood Products segment, demand remains favorable, supported by strong new residential home building and repair and remodel activity. As Devin mentioned, channel inventory started the year in a lean position and supply continues to be constrained by persistent transportation, supply chain and COVID-related labor challenges. This dynamic is expected to continue for most of the first quarter and has driven lumber and OSB benchmark pricing to unseasonably high levels quarter-to-date.\nExcluding the effect of changes in average sales realizations for lumber and oriented strand board, we expect first quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be comparable to the fourth quarter.\nFor lumber, we expect improved production volumes and unit manufacturing costs in the first quarter with slightly lower sales volumes resulting from ongoing transportation disruptions. Log costs are expected to be moderately higher than the fourth quarter primarily for Western logs.\nFor oriented strand board, we anticipate improved production volumes in the first quarter, driven by less planned maintenance and modestly higher sales volumes. We expect this will be partially offset by moderately higher fiber costs.\nAs shown on Page 23, our current and quarter-to-date sales realizations for lumber and oriented strand board are both significantly higher than the fourth quarter average.\nFor engineered wood products, we expect comparable sales realizations to the fourth quarter, and sales and production volumes will be higher, resulting from less planned maintenance in the first quarter.\nFor our distribution business, we are expecting lower adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter due to moderately lower sales volumes.\nSo I'll wrap up with some additional full year outlook items highlighted on Page 21. Our full year 2021 interest expense was $313 million. Due to the additional debt reduction during 2021, we anticipate interest expense will be $305 million for the full year 2022.\nTurning to taxes. Our full year 2021 effective tax rate was 21.5%, excluding special items, driven by the higher percentage of total income coming from our taxable REIT subsidiary. For first quarter and full year '22, we expect our effective tax rate will be between 19% and 23% before special items and based on the forecasted mix of earnings between our REIT and taxable REIT subsidiary.\nFor cash taxes, we paid a net $609 million for full year 2021, which included a $95 million tax refund received in the fourth quarter, which was associated with our 2018 voluntary pension contribution. Excluding this tax refund, our cash taxes were in line with our tax expense. Our 2021 cash taxes were slightly higher than our prior guidance due to the timing of Canadian tax payments. We expect our 2022 cash taxes will be comparable to our overall tax expense.\nFor pension and post-employment plans, the year-end 2021 funded status improved by nearly $500 million as a result of favorable asset returns and higher discount rates compared to year-end 2020. Discount rates increased by approximately 40 basis points for the U.S. plans and approximately 60 basis points for the Canadian plans. Our noncash nonoperating pension and post-employment expense was $19 million in 2021. We expect to record approximately $60 million of expense in 2022.\nCash paid for pension and post-employment plans in 2021 was $59 million. In 2022, we do not anticipate any cash contributions to our U.S. qualified pension plan and our required cash payments for all other plans will be approximately $30 million.\nTurning now to capital expenditures. Our full year 2021 capital expenditures totaled $441 million, which was slightly below our guidance due to supply chain and contract labor constraints experienced during the fourth quarter. We expect total capital expenditures for 2022 will be approximately $440 million, which includes $110 million for Timberlands, inclusive of reforestation costs; $320 million for Wood Products; and $10 million for planned corporate IT system investments.\nNow I'll turn the call back to Devin and look forward to your questions.\n\nDevin W. Stockfish\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Weyerhaeuser Company\n\nGreat. Thanks, Nancy. Before wrapping up this morning, I'll make a few comments on the housing and repair and remodel markets.\nU.S. housing activity continued at a strong pace in the fourth quarter, with total housing starts averaging more than 1.6 million units on a seasonally adjusted basis and total permits averaging more than 1.7 million units.\nFor the full year, total housing starts were nearly 1.6 million units, representing a 16% increase over 2020 and the highest annual level since 2006.\nThese increased levels of housing activity are notable, considering the persistent supply chain and labor challenges that homebuilders faced in 2021. Notwithstanding the recent uptick in mortgage rates and ongoing affordability concerns, both our near-term and longer-term housing outlook remain optimistic and is supported by encouraging housing demand fundamentals, including favorable demographics, a decade of underbuilding and historically low inventory for new and existing homes.\nTurning now to repair and remodel activity, which strengthened in the fourth quarter. Demand continued to be strong, bolstered by large professional R&R projects, which remained healthy for most of 2021, and a resurgence of smaller do-it-yourself activity following a period of temporary weakness in the summer months.\nAs we enter 2022, our outlook for repair and remodel activity continues to be positive, with demand supported by an aging housing stock, rising home equity and healthy household balance sheets.\nIn closing, our 2021 financial performance was among the best in our company's history, and I'm incredibly proud of our employees and their efforts to achieve these outstanding results.\nAdditionally, in 2021, we continued to drive improvements across each of the value levers of our investment thesis. We made great progress on upgrading our portfolio, improving our operating performance, building on our ESG leadership and demonstrating a commitment to disciplined capital allocation.\nLooking forward, we've announced a series of multiyear targets that will drive additional growth and deliver superior value for our shareholders. With our unmatched portfolio of assets, industry-leading performance, strong balance sheet and supportive macro tailwinds, we're well positioned to capitalize on favorable demand fundamentals, generate strong cash flows, grow our company and return significant amounts of cash to shareholders.\nAnd now I'd like to open the floor for questions."

[Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Andy Taylor, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you, Mr. Taylor. You may now begin.\n\nAndy Taylor\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss Weyerhaeuser's First Quarter 2023 Earnings. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. Our earnings release and presentation materials can also be found on our website. Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements, as forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call. We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, and a reconciliation of GAAP can be found in the earnings materials on our website. On the call this morning are Devin Stockfish, Chief Executive Officer; and David Wold, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Devin Stockfish.\n\nDevin W. Stockfish\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Weyerhaeuser Co.\n\nThanks, Andy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Yesterday, Weyerhaeuser reported first quarter GAAP earnings of $151 million or $0.21 per diluted share on net sales of $1.9 million. Adjusted EBITDA was $395 million, a 7% increase over the fourth quarter of 2022. These are solid results, and I'm pleased with the operational and financial performance delivered by our team despite various market and weather-related challenges throughout the quarter. Turning now to our first quarter business results. I'll begin with Timberlands on Pages 6 through 9 of our earnings slides. Timberlands contributed $120 million to first quarter earnings. Adjusted EBITDA was $188 million, a 25% increase compared to the fourth quarter.\nIn the West, adjusted EBITDA increased $33 million compared to the fourth quarter, largely driven by increased sales volumes in domestic and Chinese markets and lower per unit log and haul costs. These favorable results were partially offset by lower sales realizations. Turning to the Western domestic market. Demand and pricing for domestic logs faced downward pressure at the start of the first quarter. Mills reduced consumption in response to lower pricing and takeaway of finished products, and we're carrying elevated log inventories. As the quarter progressed, log consumption increased as end market demand improved, but log supply was constrained by consistent winter weather conditions. This dynamic drove log inventories to lower levels and cause log pricing to stabilize. For the quarter, our average domestic sales realizations were significantly lower than the fourth quarter. Our fee harvest and domestic sales volume as well as per unit log and haul costs improved in the first quarter as we return to full run rate operations following the work stoppage in the fourth quarter.\nFirst quarter harvest activity included a portion of the deferred volume resulting from the work stoppage, and we remain on track to capture the majority of the deferred harvest volume in 2023. Forest and road costs were also seasonally lower. Moving to our Western export business. Log markets in Japan continued to soften in the first quarter in response to elevated inventories of European lumber imports as well as lower consumption driven by reduced post-and-beam housing activity. As a result, our average sales realizations for export volumes to Japan were moderately lower compared to the fourth quarter, and our sales volumes were comparable. In China, log inventories at the ports declined during the quarter and daily takeaway increased as construction activity improved following the Lunar New Year and in response to the recent lifting of pandemic-related restrictions. As a result, log demand from our customers remained solid in the first quarter. Our sales volumes increased significantly compared to the fourth quarter and we intentionally flexed additional volumes to China to take advantage of improving market conditions in the first quarter.\nOur average sales realizations were slightly higher compared to the fourth quarter aided by improved ocean freight rates and a favorable exchange rate. Turning to the South. Adjusted EBITDA for Southern Timberlands increased $4 million compared to the fourth quarter. Despite reduced log consumption in response to lower finished product pricing and demand, southern sawlog and fiber markets remain fairly balanced during the first quarter as log supply was constrained by wet weather conditions. As a result, our average sales realizations were comparable to the fourth quarter. Our fee harvest volumes increased slightly despite the adverse weather conditions. Per unit log and haul costs were slightly lower in the first quarter, and forestry and road costs were slightly higher. Adjusted EBITDA in the North was comparable to the fourth quarter.\nTurning to Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources on Pages 10 and 11. And Real estate and ENR contributed $53 million to first quarter earnings and $89 million to adjusted EBITDA. First quarter EBITDA was $43 million higher than the fourth quarter primarily due to a significant increase in real estate acres sold, partially offset by a decrease in royalty income from our Energy and Natural Resources business. Similar to prior years, our real estate activities in 2023 and are more heavily weighted towards the first half of the year. Average price per acre decreased compared to the fourth quarter due to the mix of properties sold but remained elevated compared to historical levels, as we continue to benefit from steady demand for HBU properties. Despite broader macroeconomic headwinds, buyers continue to seek the safety of hard assets, resulting in high-value transactions with significant premiums to timber value.\nMoving to Wood Products on Pages 12 through 14. Wood Products generated $95 million of earnings in the first quarter and $148 million of adjusted EBITDA. First quarter adjusted EBITDA was a 25% reduction from the fourth quarter, largely driven by continued softening in wood products pricing. Regarding the lumber and OSB markets, benchmark prices for both products entered the first quarter showing signs of stabilization after receding in the back half of 2022. Pricing for both products increased slightly through early February in response to stronger-than-expected demand for housing and buyers replenishing lean inventories. The increase was more pronounced for lumber as supply concerns weighed on the market following a series of mill curtailment announcements, particularly in British Columbia. As the quarter progressed, overall buyer sentiment remains cautious. As adverse weather impacted homebuilding in several regions and in response to ongoing concerns about inflation and the economy. Despite lean inventories, orders were limited to necessity purchases through quarter end, and benchmark prices for both products were generally range bound. I would note, however, that prices for both products have trended higher as we've moved into the second quarter.\nAdjusted EBITDA for our lumber business was comparable to the fourth quarter. Both the framing lumber composite pricing and our average sales realizations decreased 9% in the first quarter. Our sales and production volumes increased significantly versus the fourth quarter which was impacted by the work stoppage at our Northwest mills. Reliability also improved across the system. With increased production in the quarter, unit manufacturing costs improved significantly. Log costs were comparable to the fourth quarter. OSB adjusted EBITDA decreased by $32 million compared to the fourth quarter, primarily due to the decrease in commodity pricing. Our average sales realizations decreased by 20% in the first quarter, largely in line with OSB composite pricing. Sales volumes were significantly higher as production volumes increased from less planned downtime for annual maintenance and transportation networks improved following adverse weather conditions late in the fourth quarter. Unit manufacturing costs and fiber costs improved moderately during the quarter.\nAdjusted EBITDA for Engineered Wood Products decreased by $28 million compared to the fourth quarter due to softening demand for EWP products. As a result, our sales and production volumes and average sales realizations were lower for most products in the first quarter. That said, we have seen a recent uptick in our order activity and our current realizations remain above pre-pandemic levels. Unit manufacturing costs were comparable to the fourth quarter and raw material costs decreased primarily for OSB web stock. Adjusted EBITDA for distribution was comparable to the fourth quarter as higher volumes and lower operating costs were offset by a decrease in realizations for EWP and commodity products. With that, I'll turn the call over to David to discuss some financial items and our second quarter outlook.\n\nDavid M. Wold\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Weyerhaeuser Company\n\nThank you, Devin, and good morning, everyone. I'll be covering key financial items and first quarter financial performance before moving into our second quarter outlook. I'll begin with key financial items, which are summarized on Page 16. We ended the quarter with approximately $800 million of cash and cash equivalents and total debt of approximately $5 billion. Our balance sheet, liquidity position and financial flexibility remain exceptionally strong. And we reinforced our flexibility in the first quarter by extending the maturity of our existing $1.5 billion revolving credit facility to 2028. In the first quarter, we generated $126 million of cash from operations. It's worth noting that the first quarter is usually our lowest operating cash flow quarter due to seasonal inventory and other working capital build. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $71 million, which is a typical level for the first quarter.\nWe returned $139 million to shareholders through the payment of our quarterly base dividend which was increased by 5.6% to $0.19 per share during the quarter. This is in line with our commitment to grow our sustainable base dividend by 5% annually through 2025. During the quarter, we also returned $660 million to shareholders through the payment of our supplemental dividend, which was associated with our 2022 financial results. We returned $35 million to shareholders through share repurchase activity in the first quarter. These shares were repurchased at an average price of $31.25 and as of quarter end, we have completed nearly $660 million of repurchase under our $1 billion authorization. Looking forward, we will continue to leverage our flexible cash return framework and look to repurchase shares opportunistically when we believe it will create shareholder value.\nFirst quarter results for our unallocated items are summarized on Page 15. Adjusted EBITDA for this segment decreased by $6 million compared to the fourth quarter. This decrease was primarily attributable to changes in intersegment profit elimination in LIFO and as well as the absence of nonrecurring health care and workers' compensation items that were benefits in the fourth quarter. Looking forward, key outlook items for the second quarter are presented on Page 18. In our Timberlands business, we expect second quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be approximately $20 million lower than the first quarter of 2023. Beginning with our Western Timberlands operations, domestic log markets were fairly tensioned at the outset of the second quarter, driven by improved pricing and takeaway of finished products, leaner than normal log inventories and log supply constraints due to persistent winter weather conditions. As the quarter progresses, we expect further improvement in log demand and an increase in log supply as the weather improved seasonally. As a result, our domestic sales realizations are expected to remain fairly stable throughout the second quarter. That said, we anticipate the quarterly average will be lower compared to the first quarter as log prices have fallen since the beginning of the year. We anticipate our fee harvest volumes will be moderately higher given seasonally favorable operating conditions in the second quarter. Forestry and road costs are expected to be significantly higher as we enter the spring and summer months, and per unit log and haul costs are expected to be significantly lower, partly due to lower fuel prices.\nMoving to the export markets, starting with Japan. As Devin mentioned, elevated inventories of European lumber imports and reduced consumption continue to weigh on log demand and pricing. We expect these conditions to persist through the second quarter. As a result, our Japanese sales volumes and realizations are expected to be lower compared to the first quarter. That said, we expect European lumber inventories to normalize as the year progresses, which should increase demand for our logs in the Japanese market. In the meantime, we are shifting a certain amount of logs to our internal mills to capitalize on domestic market conditions. In China, construction activity and log consumption continued to improve following the Lunar New Year and the lifting of pandemic-related restrictions. That said, log imports from New Zealand have increased significantly following the disruption in the first quarter due to Cyclone activity. This dynamic is likely to put downward pressure on log pricing until excess inventories are cleared. As a result, our sales realizations into China are expected to be slightly lower compared to the first quarter. We anticipate our sales volumes will be significantly lower as we direct logs to domestic customers to capture higher-margin opportunities. In the South, we expect sawlog markets to remain fairly balanced in the second quarter as log supply improves with drier weather conditions and mills bolster inventories in response to weather-related challenges in the first quarter. Southern fiber markets are expected to soften as a result of end market demand and pricing. Despite improving weather conditions, our fee harvest volumes are expected to be comparable to the first quarter largely driven by a higher mix of fiber logs as thinning activity increases following wet weather conditions earlier in the year. With a higher percentage of fiber logs we expect our sales realizations to be slightly lower compared to the first quarter.\nPer unit log and haul costs are expected to decrease slightly as a result of lower fuel prices, and forestry and road costs are expected to increase seasonally. In the north, our sales realizations are expected to be slightly lower than the first quarter and fee harvest volumes are expected to be significantly lower as we enter the spring breakup season. Turning to our Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources segment. As Devin mentioned, we are still seeing steady demand for our real estate properties, and we continue to expect a consistent flow of HBU transactions with significant premiums to timber value. For the second quarter, we expect earnings will be comparable to and adjusted EBITDA will be approximately $20 million lower than the first quarter of 2023 due to the timing and mix of real estate sales. For the full year, we continue to anticipate adjusted EBITDA of approximately $300 million for the segment. For our Wood Products segment, we expect second quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be slightly higher than the first quarter of 2023, excluding the effect of changes in average sales realizations for lumber and OSB. Benchmark prices for both lumber and OSB have been fairly stable quarter-to-date, but we are seeing signs of increased demand for wood products as we get further into the spring building season, while channel inventories remain lean. As shown on Page 19, our current and quarter-to-date average sales realizations for lumber are moderately higher than the first quarter average. For OSB, our current and quarter-to-date average sales realizations are slightly higher than the first quarter average. For our lumber business, we expect higher production and sales volumes in the second quarter and moderately lower unit manufacturing costs as operating rates at our Northwest mills return to a more normalized level, reliability improves across the system and inflationary pressures continue to ease.\nLog costs are expected to be moderately lower compared to the first quarter, primarily for Western and Southern logs. For our oriented strand board business, sales volumes are expected to be comparable to the first quarter. We expect slightly lower production volumes and moderately higher unit manufacturing costs due to more planned downtime for annual maintenance in the second quarter. Fiber costs are expected to be slightly lower. Turning to our Engineered Wood Products business. As Devin mentioned, we have seen an uptick in order activity quarter-to-date, and we expect steady demand as the quarter progresses. As a result, we anticipate significantly higher sales volumes for most products compared to the first quarter. That said, sales realizations are expected to be moderately lower as supply and demand continue to rebalance across the broader EWP market. We anticipate moderately lower raw material costs for most products, including for OSB web stock. For our distribution business, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be slightly higher compared to the first quarter due to improved sales volumes. With that, I'll now turn the call back to Devin and look forward to your questions."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Andy Taylor, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you, Mr. Taylor. You may begin.\n\nAndy Taylor\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss Weyerhaeuser's second quarter 2023 earnings. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. Our earnings release and presentation materials can also be found on our website. Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements. As forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call. We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, and a reconciliation of GAAP can be found in the earnings materials on our website. On the call this morning are Devin Stockfish, Chief Executive Officer; and Davie Wold, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Devin Stockfish.\n\nDevin W. Stockfish\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Weyerhaeuser Co.\n\nThanks, Andy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Yesterday, Weyerhaeuser reported second quarter GAAP earnings of $230 million or $0.31 per diluted share on net sales of $2 billion. Excluding special items, we earned $238 million or $0.32 per diluted share. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $469 million in the second quarter. This is a 19% increase from the first quarter and was largely driven by an increase in wood products commodity pricing and strong EWP sales volumes.\nNotwithstanding elevated mortgage rates, we've been encouraged by resilient demand for new home this year, which provided a nice tailwind for our Wood Products business in the second quarter. We delivered solid results in the quarter, and I'd like to thank our teams for their collective efforts and focus on safety, operational excellence and continuing to serve our customers. Before moving into our business results, I'd like to comment briefly on a Timberlands transaction we completed earlier this month.\nAs we reported yesterday, we acquired 22,000 acres of high-quality Timberlands in Mississippi for approximately $60 million. This acquisition is comprised of highly productive timberlands strategically located to deliver immediate synergies with existing Weyerhaeuser timber and mill operations. With a mature age class and well stock timber inventory, we expect these timberlands to generate strong cash yields. Additionally, the acquisition offers incremental real estate and natural climate solution opportunities in the future. This transaction is a great example of our ongoing efforts to enhance our portfolio with high-quality, well-managed timberlands that generate solid returns for our shareholders.\nAs highlighted on Page 22 of our earnings slides, we continue to make great progress against our target to grow our timberlands portfolio through $1 billion of disciplined investments between 2022 and 2025. To date, we've deployed approximately $360 million against this target, including the recent Mississippi transaction and the acquisitions in the Carolinas and Washington, which were completed in 2022.\nTurning now to our second quarter business results, starting with Timberlands on Pages 6 through 9 of our earnings slides. Timberlands contributed $104 million to second quarter earnings. Adjusted EBITDA was $172 million, a $16 million decrease compared to the first quarter. This was largely driven by lower average sales realizations for export logs in the West.\nTurning to the Western domestic market. Favorable weather conditions during the quarter supported increased log supply across the region. Log demand improved as mills returned to more normalized operating levels in response to strengthening lumber prices and later in the quarter, took precautionary measures to bolster log inventories ahead of wildfire season. These dynamics kept log prices fairly stable during the second quarter, and as a result, our average domestic sales realizations were comparable to the first quarter. Our fee harvest volumes were slightly higher than the first quarter as a result of favorable operating conditions. Domestic sales volumes were significantly higher as we intentionally shifted logs to the domestic customers to capture higher-margin opportunities. Per unit log and haul costs improved in the second quarter and forestry and road costs were seasonally higher.\nMoving to our Western export business. In Japan, log markets continued to soften in the second quarter in response to elevated inventories of European lumber imports as well as lower consumption driven by reduced post-and-beam housing activity. As a result, our average sales realizations for export volumes to Japan were lower compared to the first quarter, and our sales volumes were comparable. As we look forward, we expect European lumber inventories in Japan to normalize in the coming months, which should increase demand for our Douglas Spur logs into the Japanese market later in the year.\nIn China, log markets softened in the second quarter in response to an influx of log supply from New Zealand combined with the reduction in log takeaway at the ports. As a result, our average sales realizations for export volumes to China were lower compared to the first quarter. Our sales volumes were significantly lower as we intentionally flex logs to the domestic market.\nTurning to the South. Adjusted EBITDA for Southern Timberlands was $79 million, a slight reduction compared to the first quarter. Southern sawlog markets remained fairly balanced in the second quarter as log supply improved with drier conditions and Mills bolstered log inventories following weather-related challenges in the first quarter. In contrast, Southern fiber markets softened in response to elevated inventories of logs and finished goods at mills as well as lower overall demand for pulp and paper end market, in products. Given favorable operating conditions, our thinning activity increased in the second quarter, resulting in a higher mix of fiber locks.\nAs a result, our average sales realizations were slightly lower compared to the first quarter, and our fee harvest volumes were comparable. Per unit log and haul costs were slightly lower, primarily due to lower fuel prices and forestry and road costs were seasonably higher. In the North, adjusted EBITDA decreased by $4 million compared to the first quarter due to significantly lower sales volumes associated with seasonal spring breakup conditions.\nTurning now to real estate, energy and natural resources on Pages 10 and 11. Real estate and ENR contributed $52 million to second quarter earnings. Adjusted EBITDA was $70 million, a $19 million decrease compared to the first quarter, largely driven by the timing and mix of properties sold. Average price per acre increased significantly in the second quarter and remains elevated compared to historical levels. We continue to benefit from healthy demand for HBU properties, resulting in high-value transactions with significant premiums to timber value.\nI'll now make a few comments on our Natural Climate Solutions business. We continue to make progress on our forest carbon pilot project in May. In the second quarter, we completed the third-party audit process and submitted the project to the American Carbon Registry for final approval. Once approved, we expect an initial issuance of approximately 30,000 credits in year 1, and we're currently developing 2 additional projects in the U.S. South. We remain focused on positioning our credits to capture the highest value possible in the marketplace.\nMoving to Wood Products on Pages 12 through 14. Wood Products generated $218 million of earnings in the second quarter and $270 million of adjusted EBITDA. Second quarter EBITDA was an 82% improvement from the first quarter largely driven by an increase in lumber and OSB sales realizations and strong sales volumes for engineered wood products. Starting with lumber. Adjusted EBITDA was $51 million in the second quarter, a $43 million increase over the prior quarter and largely driven by improved sales realizations. Benchmark pricing for lumber held fairly stable in April and May as sentiment remained cautious. Buyers mostly limited orders to necessity purchases despite lean inventories. By mid-June, overall sentiment and benchmark pricing improved in response to stronger housing activity, perceived risks to supply from Canadian wildfires and announced mill curtailments also bolstered buying activity in June. For the quarter, the framing lumber composite was comparable to the first quarter while our average sales realizations increased by 6% with the relative outperformance driven by our regional mix and product mix.\nOur sales volumes were moderately higher compared to the first quarter as our Northwest mills returned to more normalized operating levels. Log costs were slightly lower, primarily for Western logs and unit manufacturing costs were slightly higher during the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for OSB increased by $15 million compared to the first quarter, primarily due to the increase in commodity pricing, slightly offset by higher unit manufacturing costs related to planned and unplanned downtime. Benchmark pricing for OSB entered the second quarter on an upward trajectory, largely driven by lean inventories and steady demand from new home construction activity. As the quarter progressed, buyer sentiment and benchmark pricing continued to improve as Canadian wildfires disrupted supply and in response to improving residential construction activity. As a result, the OSB composite pricing increased by 21% compared to the first quarter. Our average sales realizations increased by 11%. This relative difference was largely due to our extended order files, which result in a lag effect for OSB realizations.\nOur production and sales volumes were moderately lower in the second quarter and unit manufacturing costs were moderately higher due to planned downtime for annual maintenance and a temporary period of unplanned downtime related to wildfire activity near one of our facilities in Alberta. Fiber costs improved slightly during the quarter.\nEngineered Wood Products adjusted EBITDA increased by $62 million or 76% compared to the first quarter. This result is directly tied to improving demand for EWP products which are primarily used in single-family home building applications. As a result, our production and sales volumes were significantly higher for most products in the second quarter and unit manufacturing costs improved significantly for solid section and I-joist products. That said, our average sales realizations were lower for most products as supply and demand continue to rebalance across the broader EWP market. It's worth noting that our current EWP prices remain above pre-pandemic levels. Raw material costs decreased for all products in the second quarter.\nIn Distribution, adjusted EBITDA increased by $12 million compared to the first quarter, a 55% improvement as the business benefited from strong EWP sales volumes in the second quarter. With that, I'll turn the call over to Davie to discuss some financial items and our third quarter outlook.\n\nDavid M. Wold\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Weyerhaeuser Company\n\nThank you, Devin, and good morning, everyone. I will be covering key financial items and second quarter financial performance before moving into our third quarter outlook. I'll begin with key financial items, which are summarized on Page 16.\nWe generated $496 million of cash from operations in the second quarter and ended the period with approximately $1.8 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Total debt at quarter end was approximately $5.8 billion. In May, we took advantage of attractive capital market conditions and issued $750 million of debt due in 2026 and at a coupon of 4.75%. This debt issuance prefunded the majority of our 2023 maturities. And due to the shape of the yield curve, we were able to reinvest these cash proceeds in the interim at interest rates in excess of the bond coupon. As a result of this transaction, our full year 2023 interest expense will increase by $10 million to approximately $280 million. That said, this increase will be more than offset by the interest income earned on the invested issuance proceeds.\nIn mid-July, we used a portion of the debt issuance proceeds to repay our $118 million, 78% note at maturity, and we intend to use the remainder of issuance proceeds towards our December 2023 maturity. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $81 million. We returned $139 million to shareholders through the payment of our quarterly base dividend which was increased in the first quarter by 5.6% to $0.19 per share. In addition, we returned $50 million to shareholders through share repurchase activity in the second quarter. These shares were repurchased at an average price of $29.59 and as of quarter, our $1 billion authorization.\nLooking forward, we will continue to leverage our flexible cash return framework and look to repurchase shares opportunistically when we believe it will create shareholder value. As highlighted on Page 18, adjusted funds available for distribution for the second quarter totaled $415 million, and we have generated $470 million of adjusted FAD year-to-date. Looking forward, key outlook items for the third quarter are presented on Page 19.\nIn our Timberlands business, we expect third quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be approximately $25 million lower than the second quarter of 2023.\nTurning to our Western Timberlands operations. Domestic log demand was steady at the outset of the third quarter in response to improved pricing and a way of lumber and as mills continue to build inventories ahead of wildfire season. That said, absent fire-related disruptions in the region, log supply is expected to remain ample as the quarter progresses, largely driven by a seasonal influx of logs from nontraditional timber owners. As a result, our domestic sales realizations are expected to be moderately lower compared to the second quarter. As is typical during the warmer and dryer months, we have transitioned in the higher elevation operations, which generally have lower productivity.\nAs a result, our fee harvest volumes will be moderately lower in the third quarter. Forestry and road costs are expected to be seasonally higher as we do a significant amount of this work during the summer months and per unit log and haul costs are expected to be lower, partly due to a decrease in fuel prices.\nMoving to the export markets, starting with Japan. As Devin mentioned, elevated inventories of European lumber imports and reduced consumption continue to weigh on the Japanese log market. That said, we anticipate our Japanese sales volumes will increase compared to the second quarter due to the timing of vessels, and we expect our sales realizations to be comparable. In China, elevated log imports from New Zealand and reduced log consumption continued to have an impact on the Chinese log market. We expect these conditions to persist through the third quarter. As a result, our sales realizations into China are expected to be lower compared to the second quarter, and we anticipate our sales volumes will be significantly lower as we flex logs to domestic customers to capture higher-margin opportunities.\nIn the South, we expect sawlog markets to moderate somewhat in the third quarter and fiber markets to soften further. This is being driven by a seasonal increase in log supply, elevated mill inventories and softening demand, particularly for pulp and paper products. That said, takeaway for our logs is expected to remain steady given our delivered programs across the region. Our fee harvest volumes are expected to be comparable to the second quarter and will include a higher mix of fiber logs as increased spinning activity continues. With a higher percentage of fiber logs, we expect our sales realizations to be slightly lower compared to the second quarter.\nPer unit log and haul costs are expected to be comparable and forestry and road costs are expected to be seasonally higher. In the north, our fee harvest volumes are expected to be significantly higher compared to the second quarter as we have fully transitioned from spring breakup conditions, and our sales realizations are expected to be moderately lower due to mix.\nTurning to our Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources segment. Demand for our real estate properties remain steady, and we continue to anticipate a consistent flow of HBU transactions with significant premiums to timber value. For the third quarter, we expect earnings will be slightly higher and adjusted EBITDA will be approximately $20 million higher than the second quarter of 2023 due to the timing and mix of real estate sales. For the full year, we continue to anticipate adjusted EBITDA of approximately $300 million for the segment and now expect basis as a percentage of real estate sales to be 35% to 40% for the year.\nFor our Wood Products segment, benchmark prices for lumber and OSB entered the third quarter on an upward trajectory, supported by improving demand relatively lean inventories and the prospects of supply disruptions following an early start to wildfire season in Canada. As shown on Page 21, our current and quarter-to-date average sales realizations for lumber and OSB are well above the second quarter averages. Assuming this pricing dynamic remains intact for the balance of the third quarter, we expect our Wood Products financial results to be significantly higher compared to the second quarter of 2023. That said, excluding the effect of changes in average sales realizations for lumber and OSB, we anticipate third quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be slightly lower than last quarter.\nFor our lumber business, we expect moderately higher production and sales volumes in the third quarter and slightly lower unit manufacturing costs. Log costs are expected to be moderately lower compared to the second quarter. For our oriented strand board business, we expect production and sales volumes to be comparable to the second quarter. Unit manufacturing costs are expected to be slightly higher and fiber costs are expected to be comparable.\nTurning to our Engineered Wood Products business. As Devin mentioned, we continue to see improving demand for EWP products, and this has extended our order activity well into the third quarter. As a result, we expect our sales volumes to increase slightly compared to the second quarter. Notwithstanding this dynamic, we anticipate slightly lower sales realizations as supply and demand continue to rebalance in certain markets. That said, third quarter EWP prices are expected to remain substantially above pre-pandemic levels, and we'll continue to adjust in response to demand signals from the homebuilding segment, which has seen more strength of late, particularly for single-family construction.\nRaw material costs are expected to be higher compared to the second quarter, primarily for OSB web stock. For our distribution business, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be comparable to the second quarter. With that, I'll now turn the call back to Devin and look forward to your questions."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Andy Taylor, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you, Mr. Taylor, you may begin.\n\nAndy Taylor\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss Weyerhaeuser's second quarter 2024 earnings. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. Our earnings release and presentation materials can also be found on our website. Please review the warning statements in our earnings release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements as forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call.\nWe will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, and a reconciliation of GAAP can be found in the earnings materials on our website. On the call this morning are Devin Stockfish, Chief Executive Officer; and DavI'd Wold, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Devin Stockfish.\n\nDevin W. Stockfish\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Weyerhaeuser Co.\n\nThanks, Andy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Yesterday, Weyerhaeuser reported second quarter GAAP earnings of $173 million or $0.24 per diluted share on net sales of $1.9 billion. Excluding a special item, we earned $154 million or $0.21 per diluted share. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $410 million, a 16% increase over the first quarter.\nIn these are solid results, and I'd like to thank our teams for their continued focus and operational performances. Through their efforts, adjusted EBITDA improved across each of our business segments compared to the prior quarter, a notable achievement in light of numerous market-related challenges, particularly in the lumber market. Before getting into the businesses, I'd like to comment briefly on an exciting growth opportunity within our Southern Timberlands portfolio.\nAs we announced yesterday, we are acquiring approximately 84,000 acres of high-quality timberlands in Alabama for $244 million. The collective acreage was sourced through multiple transactions, one of which closed in the second quarter for $48 million. The remaining transactions are under contract and expected to close later this year subject to customary closing conditions. These acquisitions represent an attractive opportunity to expand our footprint in one of the strongest inland sawlog and fiber markets in the U.S.\nThese are highly productive and mature timberlands strategically positioned to demonstrate immediate synergies with existing Weyerhaeuser operations. In addition, they're expected to generate portfolio leading cash flow and harvest tons per acre within our Southern Timberlands business. As highlighted on Page 18 of our earnings slides, we've demonstrated meaningful progress toward our multiyear Timberlands growth target. Including these transactions, we will have completed approximately $775 million against our target and are on track to reach $1 billion of strategic timberlands acquisitions by the end of 2025.\nTurning now to our second quarter business results. I'll begin with Timberlands on Pages 6 through 9 of our earnings slides. Timberlands contributed $81 million to second quarter earnings. Adjusted EBITDA was $147 million, a slight improvement compared to the first quarter, largely driven by increased sales volumes out of the West. Starting with the Western domestic market, Log prices faced downward pressure in the second quarter as mills carried elevated log inventories and continue to navigate a softening lumber market.\nIn addition, log supply was ample given the seasonal improvement in weather conditions and recent mill curtailments reduced log takeaway in the region. As a result of these dynamics, our average domestic sales realizations decreased slightly compared to the first quarter. Given favorable operating conditions, our fee harvest volumes were moderately higher, and domestic sales volumes improved as demand for our logs remained stable despite softer end markets. Per unit log and haul costs increased and forestry and road costs were slightly higher.\nMoving to our Western export business. Log markets in Japan were stable in the second quarter, and demand for our logs was steady. Suppliers of European lumber into Japan continue to face shipping and cost headwinds, which has provided our customers an opportunity to pick up market share. For the second quarter, our average sales realizations for export volumes to Japan increased slightly. Sales volumes increased significantly, partially due to the timing of vessels. In China, log consumption increased modestly following the Lunar New Year holiday and log inventories at the ports declined steadily in the second quarter.\nThat said, log takeaway waned as the quarter progressed. On balance, log demand was solid from our strategic customers in the region, and we significantly increased our sales volumes into China during the second quarter. Our average sales realizations were slightly lower compared to the first quarter. Turning to the South. Adjusted EBITDA for Southern Timberlands was comparable to the first quarter. Southern sawlog markets moderated in the second quarter, largely in response to elevated mill inventories, a seasonal increase in log supply and reduced consumption as mills adjusted to lower pricing and takeaway of lumber.\nIn contrast, Southern Fiber markets were generally stable as supply and demand returned to a more normalized state. On balance, takeaway for our logs remained steady given our delivered programs across the region. As a result, our average sales realizations were comparable to the first quarter. Our fee harvest volumes and forestry and road costs were seasonally higher and per unit log in haul costs were comparable.\nIn the North, adjusted EBITDA decreased slightly compared to the first quarter due to significantly lower sales volumes associated with seasonal spring breakup conditions. Turning now to real estate, energy and natural resources on Pages 10 and 11. Real estate and ENR contributed $59 million to second quarter earnings. Adjusted EBITDA was $102 million, an $8 million increase compared to the first quarter, partially driven by higher royalty income from construction materials within our Energy and Natural Resources business.\nIn our real estate business, we continue to benefit from solid demand for HBU properties, resulting in high-value transactions with significant premiums to timber value. That said, our average price per acre declined sequentially due to the mix of acres sold in the quarter. I'll now make a few brief comments on our Natural Climate Solutions business. We continue to see strong demand for large-scale solar development and signed additional agreements in the second quarter.\nIn total, we now have over 70 agreements for potential solar projects, covering more than 130,000 acres across the U.S. South. Turning to Forest Carbon. We are advancing several projects through the development pipeline and expect to have 2 new projects in the U.S. South approved later this year. These projects, in combination with our main pilot project are expected to generate over 100,000 credits in 2024.\nLooking forward, we're encouraged by the growing support for the voluntary carbon markets and are uniquely positioned to capitalize on increasing demand for high-quality credits. Moving to Wood Products on Pages 12 through 14. Excluding a special item, Wood Products contributed $171 million to second quarter earnings. Adjusted EBITDA was $225 million, a 22% improvement over the first quarter, largely driven by an increase in OSB pricing as well as higher sales volumes and lower costs in lumber and EWP.\nStarting with lumber. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA was an $8 million loss with soft pricing as the primary headwind. Average benchmark pricing for lumber decreased by 5% compared to the first quarter. Despite solid single-family housing starts thus far in 2024, and other end markets for lumber, particularly the repair and remodel and multifamily housing segments have been more muted recently. As a result, lumber supply continued to outpace demand and buyer sentiment remained cautious in the second quarter.\nAlthough this dynamic is being felt across the North American lumber market, it's been more acute in Southern Yellow Pine given softness in treater and multifamily demand, which are proportionately larger markets in the South compared to other regions. For the lumber business, our average sales realizations decreased by 2% in the second quarter. Our sales volumes were moderately higher, partially due to increased production following winter weather disruptions in the first quarter.\nUnit manufacturing costs and log costs were both lower in the second quarter. Before moving to OSB, I'll make a few comments on our recent decision to indefinitely curtail operations at our sawmill in New Bern, North Carolina. These are always difficult decisions given the impact on employees, their families and the local community. So we did not take this decision lightly. New Bern is the smallest mill in our portfolio at 100 million board feet of capacity.\nUnlike other facilities across our mill set for a variety of reasons, we haven't invested meaningful capital in New Bern. So its cost structure was relatively challenged, making it very difficult in the current pricing environment. Given these variables, along with New Bern's limited integration with our fee timberlands, we didn't see a clear path to achieving sufficient financial results to keep the mill running. As a result, we've commenced an orderly wind down of operations and expect the mill to be fully curtailed in the third quarter.\nI do want to thank our New Bern team for their contributions to the company as well as the local community for their support over the years. We're working to minimize the impact of the curtailment by providing employment opportunities in other parts of our operations or transition services to affected employees. As for the remainder of our mill set, we are very focused on running efficiently and controlling costs. Given our deeply ingrained OpEx culture and relative position on the cost curve, we firmly believe that we're better positioned to operate through the commodity cycle than most of the industry.\nNevertheless, in light of current market conditions, we expect to reduce our lumber production by 5% to 10% in the third quarter. This will take place across our mill set and is inclusive of the new burn curtailment. And looking forward, we will continue to assess our performance, customer commitments and broader portfolio integration as we evaluate the need to further optimize our lumber operations.\nSo now turning to OSP. Adjusted EBITDA [indiscernible] million compared to the first quarter, primarily due to higher average sales realizations. Benchmark pricing for OSB began the quarter at elevated levels, but moved significantly lower as the quarter progressed largely in response to the softer-than-expected demand during the spring building season and elevated channel inventories.\nPricing stabilized by quarter end and has remained steady into July. Notwithstanding this volatility, average OSB composite pricing was 6% higher compared to the first quarter, while our average realizations were 13% higher. This relative difference was largely due to the length of our order files, which results in a lag effect for OSB realizations. Our production and sales volumes and unit manufacturing costs were comparable to the first quarter and fiber costs improved slightly.\nEngineered Wood Products adjusted EBITDA increased by $6 million compared to the first quarter. Given solid single-family construction activity, VWP market experienced a slight seasonal improvement in demand at the outset of the second quarter before stabilizing into the summer months. As a result, our sales volumes were higher across all products in the second quarter, and sales realizations were comparable for most.\nUnit manufacturing costs improved sequentially and raw material costs moved lower for solid section products but higher for I-joist primarily related to OSB web stock. In Distribution, adjusted EBITDA decreased by $2 million compared to the first quarter as lower commodity margins offset higher sales volumes. With that, I'll turn the call over to David to discuss some financial items and our third quarter outlook.\n\nDavid M. Wold\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Weyerhaeuser Company\n\nThank you, Devin, and good morning, everyone. I'll be covering key financial items and second quarter financial performance before moving into our third quarter outlook. I'll begin with key financial items, which are summarized on Page 16. We ended the quarter with $1 billion of cash with approximately $200 million earmarked for the remainder of the Timberland acquisitions we announced yesterday.\nOur balance sheet, liquidity position and financial flexibility remain exceptionally strong, and we are well positioned to navigate a range of market conditions. In the second quarter, we generated $432 million of cash from operations and capital expenditures were $91 million. We returned $146 million to shareholders through the payment of our quarterly base dividend, which was increased in the first quarter by 5.3% to $0.20 per share.\nIn addition, we returned $50 million to shareholders through share repurchase activity in the second quarter. These shares were repurchased at an average price of $29.96, and as of quarter end, we had completed approximately $850 million of repurchase under our $1 billion authorization. Looking forward, we'll continue to leverage our flexible cash return framework and look to repurchase shares opportunistically when we believe it will create shareholder value.\nSecond quarter results for our unallocated items are summarized on Page 15. Adjusted EBITDA for this segment increased by $6 million compared to the first quarter primarily attributable to changes in intersegment profit elimination and LIFO. The outlook items for the third quarter are presented on Page 19. In our Timberlands business, we expect third quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be approximately $20 million to $30 million lower than the second quarter of 2024, largely driven by lower sales volumes and realizations in the West.\nFor context, results for our Timberlands business are generally at their lowest level in the third quarter, given seasonal dynamics. Turning to our Western Timberland operations. We expect domestic log demand and pricing to face downward pressure in the third quarter as mills continue to carry elevated log inventories and navigate a challenging lumber market. As a result, our domestic sales realizations are expected to be moderately lower compared to the second quarter.\nOur fee harvest volumes will be slightly lower as we have made the seasonal transition into higher elevation operations, which generally have lower productivity. Forestry and road costs are expected to be seasonally higher in the third quarter and per unit log and haul costs are expected to be lower. Moving to the export markets. In Japan, we anticipate continued steady demand from our customers in the third quarter. As a result, our sales volumes are expected to be comparable to the second quarter.\nThat said, we anticipate a moderate decrease in our average sales realizations given ongoing consumption headwinds in the Japanese log market and the effects of a strengthening yen against the dollar. In China, log demand is expected to moderate in the third quarter in response to lower consumption levels and an increase of log inventories at the ports. As a result, our sales volumes to China are expected to be lower compared to the second quarter, and our average sales realizations are expected to decrease slightly.\nIn the South, we expect sawlog markets to moderate somewhat in the third quarter as log supply remains ample, and mills further adjust to lower pricing and takeaway of lumber. In contrast, Southern fiber markets are expected to remain stable with slight upside as the quarter progresses. On balance, takeaway for our logs is expected to remain steady given our delivered programs across the region. As a result, we expect our sales realizations will be comparable to the second quarter.\nGiven favorable weather conditions in the third quarter, we anticipate our fee harvest volumes will be moderately higher. Per unit log and haul costs are expected to be comparable and forestry and road costs are expected to be seasonally higher. In the north, our fee harvest volumes are expected to be significantly higher compared to the second quarter as we have fully transitioned from spring breakup conditions, and our sales realizations are expected to be moderately lower due to mix.\nTurning to our Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources segment. Real estate markets have remained solid year-to-date, and we have capitalized on steady demand and pricing for HBU properties. As a result, we are increasing our guidance for full year 2024 adjusted EBITDA to approximately $330 million, $10 million higher than prior guidance. We continue to expect basis as a percentage of real estate sales to be 35% to 45% for the year. And we remain on track for a year-over-year increase in contributions from our Natural Climate Solutions business as we continue to advance toward our 2025 target.\nFor the third quarter, we expect earnings will be approximately $10 million lower and adjusted EBITDA will be approximately $30 million lower than the second quarter due to the timing and mix of real estate sales. For our Wood Products segment, we expect third quarter earnings before special items and adjusted EBITDA will be lower compared to the second quarter, excluding the effects of changes in average sales realizations for lumber and OSB.\nBenchmark prices for lumber and OSB have been fairly stable in July after decreasing for most of the second quarter. For lumber, buyers remain reluctant to build inventories and supply continues to outpace demand. For OSB, supply and demand are currently more balanced, yet buyer sentiment has turned more cautious as we've transitioned beyond the spring building season.\nAs shown on Page 20, our current and quarter-to-date average sales realizations for lumber are moderately lower than the second quarter average. For OSB, our current and quarter-to-date average sales realizations are significantly lower than the second quarter average. For our lumber business, as Devin mentioned, we expect to reduce lumber production by 5% to 10% in the third quarter inclusive of the New Bern curtailment.\nAs a result, we anticipate lower sales volumes and higher unit manufacturing costs compared to the second quarter. Our log costs are expected to be slightly lower. For our OSB business, we expect lower production volumes and moderately higher unit manufacturing costs due to the planned annual maintenance outages that are typical in the third quarter. However, we anticipate our sales volumes to be comparable.\nOur fiber costs are expected to be slightly higher in the third quarter, primarily in Canada. In our Engineered wood products business, we continue to see steady demand for our products given solid single-family construction activity. As a result, we expect our sales volumes to be comparable to the second quarter. We anticipate moderately lower sales realizations, primarily for plywood and MDF products.\nRaw material costs are expected to be lower in the third quarter, primarily for OSB web stock. For our distribution business, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be slightly lower compared to the second quarter due to a decrease in commodity realizations. With that, I'll now turn the call back to Devin and look forward to your questions.\n\nDevin W. Stockfish\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Weyerhaeuser Co.\n\nThanks, Davie. Before wrapping up this morning, I'll make a few comments on the housing and repair and remodel markets. Starting with housing. Despite a softer-than-expected spring building season, our macro view on the housing market is largely unchanged from the last quarter. The single-family segment is holding up reasonably well, covering around 1 million units year-to-date, and notwithstanding elevated mortgage interest rates, single-family construction activity continues to be supported by healthy underlying demand for housing, a limited inventory of existing homes on the market and actions taken by the larger public homebuilders to offset affordability challenges.\nIn contrast, the multifamily segment has been more challenged given the significant amount of new supply entering the market this year on top of elevated supply in 2023 and the impact of higher rates on new projects. Moving into the second half of 2024, we're still expecting solid single-family building activity with potential upside if mortgage rates come down as the year progresses. And that's consistent with what we're hearing from our homebuilding customers. In contrast, we expect multifamily to remain soft through year-end and into 2025. Longer term, our view on housing fundamentals continues to be favorable, supported by strong demographic trends and a vastly underbuilt housing stock. Turning to the repair and remodel market. Activity has been softer year-to-date, particularly in the do-it-yourself segment. However, the Professional segment is still holding up relatively well. To a certain extent, persistent inflationary pressures are weighing on consumer sentiment and spending. We're also seeing some near-term headwinds from fewer people buying and selling homes in the current environment.\nBut as we think about the back half of 2024, we are expecting fairly steady repair and remodel activity, albeit at levels below the last several years and would expect demand to increase when interest rates move lower and consumer sentiment improves. And longer term, many of the key drivers supporting solid repair and remodel activity remain intact, including favorable home equity levels and an aging housing stock.\nSo in closing, our teams delivered solid operating performance in the second quarter, and we continue to make meaningful progress on multiyear growth targets to enhance our timberlands portfolio and advance our Natural Climate Solutions business. Although near-term market conditions have moderated, we maintain a constructive longer-term outlook for the demand fundamentals that support growth in housing, repair and remodel and natural climate solutions. And with our unmatched portfolio of assets, our strong balance sheet and disciplined approach to capital allocation, we're well positioned to execute against our strategy and navigate a range of market conditions.\nWe remain relentlessly focused on operational excellence and innovation and are committed to serving our customers and delivering superior long-term value for our shareholders. So with that, I think we can open it up for questions."

[Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce Andy Taylor, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you, Mr. Taylor, you may begin.\n\nAndy Taylor\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss Weyerhaeuser's first quarter 2024 earnings. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. Our earnings release and presentation materials can also be found on our website. Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements as forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call. We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, and a reconciliation of GAAP can be found in the earnings materials on our website. On the call this morning are Devin Stockfish, Chief Executive Officer; and Davie Wold, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Devin Stockfish.\n\nDevin W. Stockfish\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Weyerhaeuser Co.\n\nThanks, Andy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Yesterday, Weyerhaeuser reported first quarter GAAP earnings of $114 million or $0.16 per diluted share on net sales of $1.8 million. Adjusted EBITDA was $352 million, a 10% increase over the fourth quarter of 2023. These are solid results, and I'm pleased with the operational and financial performance delivered by our teams.\nTurning now to our first quarter business results. I'll begin with Timberlands on Pages 6 through 9 of our earnings slides. Timberlands contributed $80 million to first quarter earnings. Adjusted EBITDA was $144 million, which was comparable to the fourth quarter. In the West, adjusted EBITDA increased by $3 million compared to the prior quarter. Starting with the Western domestic market. Adverse weather conditions in January temporarily impacted log supply and demand across the region. As the quarter progressed, log supply in the system increased as weather conditions improved. Several recent mill curtailments primarily in Oregon also added to log availability in the region.\nDespite this dynamic, the market remained fairly balanced due to healthy log demand and improvements in lumber pricing. As a result, pricing for our logs was comparable to the fourth quarter. That said, our average domestic sales realizations decreased slightly, largely driven by a lower percentage of grade logs in our mix. For the quarter, our domestic sales volumes were significantly higher as we strategically shifted logs to domestic customers. Fee harvest volumes were moderately higher and per unit log and haul costs were significantly lower. As we made the seasonal transition to lower elevation and lower-cost harvest operations. Forestry and road costs were seasonally lower.\nMoving to our Western export business. Log markets in Japan were stable in the first quarter. Despite ongoing consumption headwinds, demand for our logs remained steady as our customers benefited from lower volumes of competing European lumber imports. As a result, our average sales realizations for export volumes to Japan were comparable to the fourth quarter. Our sales volumes were moderately lower due to the timing of vessels. In China, log inventories at the ports grew in the first quarter as a result of reduced consumption during the Lunar New Year holiday and increased log imports from New Zealand. However, log takeaway improved as the quarter progressed. Despite steady demand for our logs, our sales volumes into China were significantly lower in the first quarter as we intentionally flexed log sales to the domestic market. Our average sales realizations were slightly higher compared to the fourth quarter.\nTurning to the South. Adjusted EBITDA for Southern Timberlands decreased by $4 million compared to the fourth quarter. Southern sawlog markets moderated somewhat in the first quarter largely in response to elevated mill inventories and ample log supply. In contrast, Southern fiber markets were stable in the first quarter as supply and demand trended to a more balanced state. Given these dynamics, our average sales realizations were comparable to the fourth quarter. Per unit log and haul costs were also comparable and forestry and road costs were seasonally lower. Our fee harvest volumes decreased slightly in the first quarter. In the North, adjusted EBITDA increased by $1 million compared to the fourth quarter as sales realizations increased moderately. Fee harvest volumes were moderately lower in the first quarter, largely driven by the early onset of spring breakup conditions.\nTurning to our Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources on Pages 10 and 11. Real estate and ENR contributed $60 million to first quarter earnings and $94 million to adjusted EBITDA. First quarter EBITDA was $27 million higher than the fourth quarter primarily attributable to an increase in real estate acres sold. Average price per acre decreased compared to the fourth quarter due to the mix of properties sold but remained elevated compared to historical levels. We continue to benefit from solid demand for HBU properties, resulting in high-value transactions with significant premiums to timber value.\nNow for some comments on our Natural Climate Solutions business. In February, we announced an exploratory agreement with Lapis Energy to pursue carbon capture and sequestration projects across 5 potential sites in the U.S. South. The agreement represents a unique opportunity to scale our CCS offerings. To date, we've entered into 3 CCS agreements covering up to 7 sites across our Southern timber holdings. And we remain focused on developing new projects and intend to enter into additional agreements over the next few years.\nTurning to forest carbon. On the heels of our first approved project in Maine, we're advancing 2 projects in the U.S. South that are expected to be completed later this year. Combined, these 3 projects are expected to generate over 100,000 credits in 2024 and we intend to sell these credits into the voluntary market. Looking forward, we have several additional projects in the development pipeline and continue to see strong demand for high-quality credits.\nLastly, I'll make a few comments on the progress we're making on our renewable energy business with a specific focus on solar. Given our unmatched portfolio in the U.S. South, we are uniquely positioned to drive meaningful value across our land base as demand for large-scale solar development increases. In total, we've signed over 60 agreements for potential solar projects covering more than 100,000 acres across 11 states. Notably, we recently signed sizable agreements in Georgia and Mississippi, and currently have several projects in late stages of development with one expected to be operational later this year. We've been very selective in choosing the counterparties to these agreements and have built an outstanding portfolio of projects with experienced and successful developers and utilities. Looking forward, we continue to see strong demand as this market continues to develop and we expect to sign additional agreements over the next several years.\nMoving to Wood Products on Pages 12 through 14. Wood Products contributed $128 million to first quarter earnings. Adjusted EBITDA was $184 million, a 16% increase from the fourth quarter. Starting with lumber. First quarter adjusted EBITDA was a $5 million loss but improved by $29 million compared to the fourth quarter, largely driven by a slight increase in sales realizations. Adverse weather conditions in January and cautious buyer sentiment weighed on the lumber market at the outset of the first quarter. As the quarter progressed, demand signals improved slightly, particularly for Western SPF and Douglas fir species. This drove modest pricing improvements through mid-March. In contrast, southern lumber markets faced persistent headwinds during the quarter, given weather-related challenges, a moderation in demand and ample supply of finished products.\nFor the quarter, our average sales realizations increased by 4% compared to the fourth quarter, largely in line with the framing lumber composite. Our sales volumes decreased slightly, partially driven by winter weather disruptions early in the quarter. Unit manufacturing costs increased slightly and log costs were slightly lower. OSB adjusted EBITDA increased by $14 million compared to the fourth quarter, primarily due to an increase in product pricing. Benchmark pricing for OSB was relatively stable through February, but increased significantly in March. This improvement was largely driven by lean inventories, supply limitations and resilient demand from new home construction activity. As a result, our average sales realizations increased by 4% compared to the fourth quarter, while the average OSB composite pricing increased by 13%.\nThis relative difference was largely due to our extended order files, which result in a lag effect for OSB realizations. Our production and sales volumes were slightly higher in the first quarter and unit manufacturing costs improved. Fiber costs were slightly higher. Adjusted EBITDA for engineered wood products decreased by $18 million compared to the fourth quarter. Primarily due to a decrease in average sales realizations as previously determined price adjustments took effect in certain markets. Our sales volumes for solid section products were comparable to the fourth quarter, while I-joist volumes were lower. Both unit manufacturing and raw material costs increased for most products in the first quarter. A couple of things worth noting for context regarding our engineered wood products in Q1.\nFirst, we did ship somewhat higher EWP volumes to customers in the fourth quarter of last year after having been on allocation for most of 2023. And consequently, customer inventories were slightly elevated entering the new year. Also, while single-family construction activity remained resilient, we experienced the typical seasonal pattern in EWP demand in the first quarter. That all being said, we expect healthy demand from the single-family segment as we get further into the spring building season. As a result, we anticipate higher sales volumes and stable sales realizations from our EWP business in the second quarter. In distribution, adjusted EBITDA increased by $4 million compared to the fourth quarter largely driven by an improvement in commodity realizations and margins.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Davie to discuss some financial items and our second quarter outlook.\n\nDavid M. Wold\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Weyerhaeuser Company\n\nThanks, Devin, and good morning, everyone. I'll be covering key financial items and first quarter financial performance before moving into our second quarter outlook. I'll begin with key financial items, which are summarized on Page 16. Our balance sheet remains exceptionally strong with approximately $900 million of cash and total debt of just under $5.1 billion at the end of the quarter. In the first quarter, we generated $124 million of cash from operations. It's worth noting that the first quarter is usually our lowest operating cash flow quarter due to seasonal inventory and other working capital build. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $79 million, which is a typical level for the first quarter. We returned $146 million to shareholders through the payment of our quarterly base dividend, which we increased by 5.3% to $0.20 per share during the quarter.\nThis is in line with our commitment to grow our sustainable base dividend by 5% annually through 2025. During the quarter, we also returned $102 million to shareholders through the payment of our supplemental dividend, which was associated with our 2023 financial results. First quarter share repurchase activity totaled approximately $50 million. And as of quarter end, we have completed nearly $800 million of repurchase under our $1 billion authorization. Looking forward, we will continue to leverage our flexible cash return framework and repurchase shares opportunistically when we believe it will create shareholder value. First quarter results for our unallocated items are summarized on Page 15. Adjusted EBITDA for this segment decreased by $22 million compared to the fourth quarter partially attributable to changes in intersegment profit elimination and LIFO. Looking forward, key outlook items for the second quarter are presented on Page 18.\nIn our Timberlands business, we expect second quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be slightly higher than the first quarter of 2024. Turning to our Western Timberlands operations, we expect steady to increasing log demand in the domestic market in the second quarter as mills respond to improving lumber takeaway as we get deeper into the spring building season. That said, log supply is expected to increase as weather conditions improve seasonally. On balance, this should translate to a fairly stable domestic log market. As a result, we expect our domestic sales realizations to be comparable to the first quarter. We anticipate our fee harvest volumes will be moderately higher given seasonally favorable operating conditions in the second quarter. Forestry and road costs are expected to be higher as we enter the spring and summer months, and per unit log and haul costs are also expected to be higher.\nMoving to the export markets. In Japan, we anticipate stable log markets and steady demand from our customers in the second quarter. As a result, we expect our average sales realizations for export volumes to Japan to be comparable to the first quarter. Our sales volumes are expected to increase, largely due to the timing of vessels. In China, we expect a modest increase in construction activity and log consumption following the Lunar New Year holiday. And given steady log demand from our strategic customers, we expect to significantly increase our sales volumes into China in the second quarter. Our average sales realizations are expected to be comparable to the first quarter.\nMoving to the South. Log inventories were elevated at the outset of the second quarter, and log supply is expected to increase seasonally. As the quarter progresses, we expect sawlog demand to remain relatively stable and fiber demand to soften in response to increased annual maintenance outages. On balance, takeaway for our logs is expected to remain steady given our delivered programs across the region. As a result, we expect our sales realizations will be comparable to the first quarter. Our fee harvest volumes and forestry and road costs are expected to be higher due to drier weather conditions that are typical in the second quarter and we anticipate comparable per unit log and haul costs. In the north, our sales realizations are expected to be moderately higher than the first quarter and fee harvest volumes are expected to be significantly lower given spring breakup conditions.\nTurning to our Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources segment. As Devin mentioned, we are still seeing solid demand for our real estate properties, and we continue to expect a consistent flow of HBU transactions with significant premiums to timber value. For the second quarter, we expect adjusted EBITDA will be comparable to and earnings will be approximately $10 million lower than the first quarter of 2024 due to the timing and mix of real estate sales. For the full year, we maintain our adjusted EBITDA guidance of approximately $320 million for the segment, which includes a year-over-year increase in contributions from Natural Climate Solutions as we continue to advance toward our 2025 target for that business. For our Wood Products segment, we expect second quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be slightly higher than the first quarter of 2024, excluding the effect of changes in average sales realizations for lumber and OSB.\nThis is largely driven by improved sales volumes across our Wood Products businesses and favorable cost for lumber. I will note that we do expect demand for wood products to remain healthy, supported by improving housing and repair and remodel activity as we move further into the spring. As shown on Page 19, our current and quarter-to-date average sales realizations for lumber are slightly higher than the first quarter average. That said, the framing lumber composite has trended lower over the last several weeks. For OSB, our current and quarter-to-date average sales realizations are significantly higher than the first quarter average. As Devin mentioned, our extended order files result in a lag effect for OSB realizations. As a result, most of the OSB price improvement that we saw in March will be captured in our second quarter realizations.\nFor our lumber business, we expect higher production and sales volumes in the second quarter and moderately lower unit manufacturing costs. Log costs are expected to be slightly lower. For our OSB business, we anticipate sales volumes to be moderately higher than the first quarter with comparable unit manufacturing costs. Fiber costs are expected to be slightly higher in the second quarter. In our Engineered Wood Products business, we anticipate higher sales volumes across all products. Our average sales realizations are expected to be comparable to the first quarter. Raw material costs are expected to be higher primarily for OSB web stock. For our distribution business, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be higher compared to the first quarter due to increased sales volumes and stronger commodity realizations.\nWith that, I'll now turn the call back to Devin and look forward to your questions.\n\nDevin W. Stockfish\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Weyerhaeuser Co.\n\nThanks, Davie. Before wrapping up this morning, I'll make a few comments on the housing and repair and remodel markets, starting with housing. On balance, our macro view on the housing market is largely unchanged. Despite elevated mortgage interest rates, the single-family segment remains solid and continues to be supported by strong overall demand for housing, a limited inventory of existing homes on the market and actions taken by the large homebuilders to offset affordability challenges. In contrast, activity in the multifamily segment has moderated given the elevated interest rate environment and the recent and upcoming influx of multifamily units entering the market. As a reminder, single-family construction is a much more important demand driver for our business than multifamily.\nFor the first quarter, housing starts averaged 1.4 million units on a seasonally adjusted basis with single-family starts holding up well. However, we do think homebuilding activity in the first quarter was impacted to some degree by various weather events across the U.S. So the spring building season has been a little slower to kick into high gear. As we move deeper into 2024, we're still expecting healthy demand for housing, particularly in the single-family segment. That's consistent with what we are hearing from our homebuilding customers. And longer term, our view on the housing fundamentals continues to be very favorable, supported by strong demographic trends and a vastly underbilled housing stock.\nTurning to repair and remodel. Activity has been a little softer to start off the year, particularly in the do-it-yourself segment. Moving forward, we expect R&R activity to pick up somewhat as weather conditions improve and continue to believe that demand will ultimately be supported by prospective homebuyers that elect to remodel in lieu of purchasing a new home in the current rate environment. And beyond 2024, most of the key drivers supporting solid repair and remodel demand remain intact including favorable home equity levels and an aging housing stock. So in closing, we delivered solid results across our businesses in the first quarter. We also continue to make progress toward our multiyear targets by increasing our quarterly base dividend and signing our third CCS agreement.\nLooking forward, we're encouraged by the strong underlying fundamentals that will drive long-term growth for housing and repair and remodel demand and natural climate solutions. And given our unmatched portfolio of assets, we're uniquely positioned to capitalize on these opportunities well into the future. Our balance sheet is exceptionally strong, and we remain focused on driving peer-leading performance across our businesses, serving our customers and delivering superior long-term value and returns for our shareholders. With that, I think we can open it up for questions."

Stockfish\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Weyerhaeuser Co.\n\nSo in closing, our performance in 2023 reflects solid execution across our businesses. As we enter 2024, we're encouraged by resiliency in the housing market and maintain a favorable long-term outlook for the demand fundamentals that will drive growth for our businesses. Our balance sheet is exceptionally strong, and we remain focused on serving our customers and driving long-term value for shareholders through our unrivaled portfolio, industry-leading performance, strong ESG foundation and disciplined capital allocation. So with that, I think we can open it up for questions.\nAnd finally, we continue to demonstrate our ongoing commitment to disciplined capital allocation by increasing our quarterly dividend by more than 5% annually and returning nearly $4.6 billion of cash to shareholders based on our results from 2021 through 2023. We're incredibly proud of these accomplishments, all of which have made Weyerhaeuser a stronger and more valuable company. Looking forward, we remain committed to driving continued improvements across each of these areas and are well positioned to achieve our strategic targets by year-end 2025.\nFinally, I'd like to provide an update on the progress we've made against the multiyear targets we announced during our Investor Day in September of 2021. As highlighted on Slide 21, we've made notable advancements on all fronts. Starting with our portfolio, we've more than -- we're more than halfway to our $1 billion Timberlands growth target, and we've increased Natural Climate Solutions EBITDA by 114% since the inception of that business. In terms of our operating performance, we've made progress against all of our OpEx priorities and have captured $77 million of margin improvements over the last 2 years. Additionally, through the third quarter of 2023, we delivered peer-leading EBITDA margins across all of our Wood Products businesses and are #1 in EBITDA per acre in Western Timberlands. On the ESG front, we're making progress on reducing our greenhouse gas emissions and have committed to net zero emissions by 2040.\nTurning to repair and remodel. Activity in the fourth quarter remained steady, and barring significant weather disruptions, we expect a similar level of repair and remodel demand in the first quarter. As for 2024, we believe the underlying demand fundamentals are incrementally more positive compared to last year, supported by otherwise prospective homebuyers choosing to remodel in lieu of purchasing a new home and a higher mortgage rate environment, combined with a healthier economy. And based on recent trends, we think activity will be more heavily weighted toward the Pro segment versus DIY. Looking beyond 2024, most of the key drivers supporting healthy repair and remodel demand remain intact, including favorable home equity levels and an aging housing stock.\nGiven the tailwinds from last year, along with improving mortgage rates and a more favorable macro environment, our outlook for single-family housing demand in 2024 is more optimistic relative to this time last year. And that aligns with what we are hearing from our homebuilder customers. We are, however, somewhat less optimistic about the multifamily segment in the near term, largely driven by the recent and upcoming influx of multifamily units entering the market. As a reminder, single-family construction is a much more important demand driver for our business than multifamily. All in all, we're more positive on the housing setup for 2024 and believe we should see an uptick in demand for our products. And our longer-term view on housing fundamentals continues to be very favorable, supported by strong demographic trends and a vastly underbuilt housing stock.\nThanks, Davie. Before wrapping up this morning, I'll make a few comments on the housing and repair and remodel markets and touch briefly on our multiyear targets. Starting with housing. Despite elevated mortgage interest rates for most of the year, the housing market remained resilient in 2023, particularly in the single-family segment. This was supported by a limited inventory of existing homes on the market, combined with the homebuilder's ability to offer mortgage rate buydowns and other incentives and underpinned by a strong overall demand for housing.\n\nDavid M. Wold\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Weyerhaeuser Company\n\nTurning now to capital expenditures. Our full year 2023 capital investments totaled $440 million plus $7 million of capitalized interest. We expect total capital for 2024 will be comparable at approximately $440 million, which includes: $115 million for Timberlands, inclusive of reforestation costs; $310 million for Wood Products; and $15 million for planned corporate IT system investments. With that, I'll now turn the call back to Devin and look forward to your questions.\nFor pension and post-employment plans, our noncash, nonoperating pension and post-employment expense was $45 million in 2023. For 2024, we expect this expense will be comparable to 2023. Cash paid for pension and post-employment plans in 2023 was $20 million. In 2024, we do not anticipate any cash contributions to our U.S. qualified pension plan, and our required cash payments for all other plans will be approximately $20 million.\nI'll wrap up with some additional full year outlook items highlighted on Page 25. Our full year 2023 interest expense was $280 million. For full year 2024, we expect interest expense will be approximately $275 million. Turning to taxes, our full year 2023 effective tax rate was approximately 12%, excluding special items. For first quarter and full year 2024, we expect our effective tax rate will be between 13% and 16% before special items based on the forecasted mix of earnings between our REIT and taxable REIT subsidiary. For cash taxes, we paid $63 million for full year 2023, which was lower than our tax expense, excluding special items due to the timing of U.S. and Canadian tax payments. We expect our 2024 cash taxes will be comparable to our overall tax expense.\nTurning to our Engineered Wood Products business. We expect improving demand heading into the spring building season. As a result, we anticipate moderately higher sales volumes in the first quarter, primarily for solid section products. Our average sales realizations are expected to be slightly lower for most products as previously determined price adjustments take effect in certain markets. Raw material costs are expected to be slightly lower compared to the fourth quarter. For our distribution business, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be higher compared to the fourth quarter, primarily driven by an increase in commodity realizations and higher sales volumes.\nFor our oriented strand board business, we anticipate sales volumes to be moderately higher compared to the fourth quarter with slightly lower unit manufacturing costs. Fiber costs are expected to be slightly higher in the first quarter. As shown on Page 26, our current and quarter-to-date average sales realizations for lumber and OSB are slightly higher than the fourth quarter averages.\nTurning to our Wood Products segment. Benchmark prices for lumber and OSB have increased from lower levels in the fourth quarter but have remained fairly stable over the last several weeks. As the quarter progresses, we expect improving market conditions and demand for both products heading into the spring building season. Excluding the effects of changes in average sales realizations for lumber and OSB, we expect first quarter adjusted EBITDA and earnings before special items to be slightly higher compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. For our lumber business, we expect higher production and sales volumes in the first quarter and moderately lower unit manufacturing costs as operating conditions improve. Log costs are expected to be slightly lower, primarily in Canada.\nMoving to our Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources segment. We anticipate steady demand for our real estate properties in 2024 and continue to expect a consistent flow of transactions with significant premiums to timber value. In our Natural Climate Solutions business, we anticipate a significant increase in EBITDA in 2024 as we continue to advance toward our $100 million target. For the segment, we expect full year 2024 adjusted EBITDA of approximately $320 million. Basis as a percentage of real estate sales is expected to be approximately 35% to 45% for the year. First quarter earnings are expected to be comparable to the fourth quarter of 2023, while adjusted EBITDA is expected to be approximately $15 million higher primarily due to the timing and mix of real estate sales.\nTurning to the South. Despite ample log inventories, Southern log markets are expected to be fairly stable in the first quarter as mills respond to a seasonal reduction in log supply and the prospect of increased demand for finished goods. As a result, we expect our average sales realizations to be comparable to the fourth quarter. Our fee harvest volumes and forestry and road costs are expected to be moderately lower due to wet weather conditions that are typical in the first quarter, and we anticipate comparable per unit log and haul costs. In the North, our fee harvest volumes are expected to be comparable to the fourth quarter, and we anticipate moderately higher sales realizations due to mix. Turning to our full year harvest plan. For 2024, we expect total company fee harvest volumes to increase to approximately 35.5 million tons, with all regions delivering slightly higher volumes compared to 2023 levels.\nIn China, log demand is expected to moderate in the first quarter in response to reduced consumption during the Lunar New Year holiday. Given this dynamic, coupled with improving Western domestic market conditions, we expect to significantly decrease our sales volumes into China during the quarter. Our average sales realizations are expected to be comparable to the fourth quarter.\nMoving to the export markets, starting with Japan. As Devin mentioned, we expect to deliver higher sales volumes into the Japanese market in the first quarter. This is largely in response to measures taken by one of our customers to increase production following a fire at their sawmill in the third quarter of last year. With a more balanced Japanese log market and improving conditions in the Western domestic market, we anticipate slightly higher average sales realizations for our export logs into Japan in the first quarter.\nTurning to our Western Timberlands operations, we expect steady log demand in the domestic market in the first quarter as mills respond to seasonally lower log supply and the prospect of improving lumber takeaway ahead of the spring building season. Given this dynamic, we expect higher domestic sales volumes compared to the fourth quarter. That said, we anticipate a slight decrease in our overall and our average domestic sales realizations largely driven by a lower mix of grade logs. Absent weather-related disruptions, we expect our fee harvest volumes to be moderately higher in the first quarter. Per unit log and haul costs are expected to be significantly lower as we make the seasonal transition to lower elevation and lower-cost harvest operations. And forestry and road costs are expected to be moderately lower due to the seasonal nature of these activities.\nFourth quarter results for our unallocated items are summarized on Page 16. Adjusted EBITDA for this segment increased by $8 million compared to the third quarter. This increase was primarily attributable to changes in intersegment profit elimination and LIFO. Key outlook items for the first quarter and full year 2024 are presented on Pages 24 and 25. In our Timberlands business, we expect first quarter earnings before special items and adjusted EBITDA to be comparable to the fourth quarter of 2023.\nTurning to the balance sheet. We ended the year with approximately $1.2 billion of cash and cash equivalents, of which $102 million is earmarked for the supplemental dividend we announced yesterday that will be paid in February. In December, we repaid our $860 million, 5.2% private note at maturity and also closed on a 5-year $250 million variable rate term loan. This completes a series of transactions over the course of the year, along with our $750 million bond issuance in May to refinance approximately $1 billion of debt. We ended the year with gross debt of $5.1 billion, consistent with our total as of the prior year-end, and we have no further debt maturities until 2025.\nThank you, Devin, and good morning, everyone. I'll be covering key financial items and fourth quarter financial performance before moving into our first quarter and full year 2024 outlook. I'll begin with key financial items which are summarized on Page 17. We generated $288 million of cash from operations in the fourth quarter, bringing our total for the year to more than $1.4 billion. As Devin mentioned, we are returning $783 million to shareholders based on 2023 results, which includes $125 million of share repurchases. Fourth quarter share repurchase activity totaled $15 million, and we have now completed approximately $750 million of activity under our $1 billion share repurchase authorization. Entering 2024, we will continue to leverage our flexible cash return framework and look to repurchase shares opportunistically when we believe it will create shareholder value.\n\nDevin W. Stockfish\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Weyerhaeuser Co.\n\nIn Distribution, adjusted EBITDA decreased $15 million compared to the third quarter, largely driven by a decrease in commodity realizations and seasonally lower sales volumes. With that, I'll turn the call over to Davie to discuss some financial items and our first quarter and 2024 outlook.\nEngineered Wood Products delivered $104 million of adjusted EBITDA, a decrease of $21 million compared to the third quarter. Sales realizations for most products decreased slightly as supply and demand continue to rebalance in certain markets. I would note, however, that pricing remains quite healthy on a historical basis. Sales volumes were lower for most products compared to the third quarter, driven by seasonally lower demand and improving supply across the EWP market. Unit manufacturing costs were slightly lower in the fourth quarter and raw material costs increased primarily for OSB web stock.\nAs we enter 2024, market conditions are starting to improve, and we expect stronger performance from our lumber business in the first quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for OSB was $73 million, a decrease of $45 million compared to the third quarter, primarily due to lower product pricing. Benchmark pricing for OSB began the quarter on a downward trajectory but stabilized by the end of October and increased through year-end. This improvement was largely driven by lean inventories, supply limitations and a resilient demand from new home construction activity. As a result, our OSB pricing exited the quarter at a higher level than where we entered. However, our fourth quarter average realizations decreased by 17% compared to the prior quarter. Our sales volumes and fiber costs were comparable to the third quarter, and unit manufacturing costs were moderately lower.\nThat said, buyer sentiment and product pricing started to improve toward the end of the year, following stronger-than-expected housing starts data and positive signals from the Fed on the trajectory of interest rates. Our fourth quarter performance was further impacted by a decrease in production levels, which resulted in lower sales volumes and higher unit manufacturing costs. This was largely driven by a combination of taking additional holiday downtime at our Pacific Northwest mills, a period of downtime at our mill in British Columbia and operating challenges at certain facilities. Market conditions were particularly challenging in the Northwest in the fourth quarter, given the more rapid decline in lumber pricing compared to log prices.\nSo now moving on to Wood Products on Pages 13 through 15. Wood Products contributed $105 million to earnings before special items in the fourth quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $159 million, a 52% reduction from the third quarter, largely driven by lower commodity pricing. Starting with lumber. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was a $34 million loss. Weaker product pricing was the primary driver as the framing lumber composite posted its lowest quarterly average in a number of years. Our average sales realizations decreased 14% compared to the third quarter. This was driven by cautious buyer sentiment and ample lumber supply in the North American market.\nAs we think about the future, we remain focused on growing our NCS business to $100 million of EBITDA by year-end 2025, and we see significant future upside as markets continue to develop, particularly in carbon and renewables. And with the work we've already completed and the prospects of advancing NCS across our expansive timberland holdings, we have a lot of conviction that there is no company in this space with the capabilities or asset base to deliver on this value creation opportunity at scale like Weyerhaeuser.\nAs we look back over the last several years, I'm extremely proud of the progress that we've made in our Natural Climate Solutions business and the leadership we've demonstrated along the way. We were the first company in our space to embark on this journey in a comprehensive manner and had delivered notable accomplishments across all of our NCS businesses. And in the process, we built a world-class team with deep technical expertise and a strong commercial focus. We've laid the foundation to develop and advance our NCS offerings in-house, allowing Weyerhaeuser to capture the vast majority of the economics associated with these opportunities. And we've quickly established a peer-leading position in emerging carbon markets.\nTurning to our carbon capture and sequestration business. We continue to see solid progress being made on the projects we've announced with Oxy Low Carbon Ventures and Exxon, and both are expected to be online in late 2025 or 2026. Moving forward, we continue to advance discussions with high-quality CCS developers on portions of our Southern U.S. acreage and expect to announce additional agreements in the future.\nI'll now make a few comments on our Natural Climate Solutions business. As shown on Page 23, our full year adjusted EBITDA was $47 million. This represents a 9% increase compared to 2022 and a 114% increase since the inception of this business in 2020. For 2023, we achieved solid contributions from conservation, mitigation banking and renewables, and demand for these businesses continues to grow. In addition, we achieved notable milestones in our forest carbon business in 2023, including the approval of our pilot project in Maine and the monetization of the initial credits from this project. These credits were sold in the fourth quarter at a strong price and demonstrate our commitment to offering only the highest quality credits to the market. Looking forward, we expect the new issuance of credits from our Maine project later this year. Further, we're developing additional forest carbon projects within our U.S. timberlands. We anticipate receiving approval on 2 projects in the U.S. South in early '24 and intend to monetize additional credits in the voluntary market this year.\nTurning now to Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources on Pages 11 and 12. For the full year, Real Estate and ENR generated $320 million of adjusted EBITDA, slightly higher than our revised full year guidance. In the fourth quarter, the segment contributed $50 million to earnings. Adjusted EBITDA was $67 million, a $27 million decrease compared to the third quarter, largely driven by the timing and mix of properties sold. Average price per acre increased from the prior quarter and remains elevated compared to historical levels as we continue to see stable interest from buyers for HBU properties, resulting in high-value transactions with significant premiums to timber value.\nTurning to the South. Southern sawlog and fiber markets softened slightly in the fourth quarter, largely in response to ample log supply, elevated mill inventories and reduced demand for finished goods. Despite these market dynamics, demand for our logs remained steady, given our delivered programs across the region. As a result, our average sales realizations and fee harvest volumes were comparable to the third quarter. Per unit log and haul costs were also comparable and forestry and road costs were seasonally lower.\nIn China, log supply into the region has adjusted to lower consumption levels, and the market was largely balanced in the fourth quarter. As a result, our average sales realizations for export volumes to China were comparable to the third quarter. Given steady demand from our Chinese customers, coupled with moderating market conditions in Western domestic market, we significantly increased our sales volumes into China in the fourth quarter.\nMoving to the Western export business. In Japan, despite ongoing consumption headwinds, inventories of European lumber imports have largely normalized, and the Japanese log market returned to a more balanced state in the fourth quarter. As a result, our average sales realizations for export volumes to Japan were comparable to the third quarter. Our Japanese sales volumes were slightly lower in the fourth quarter and continued to be impacted by reduced shipments to a customer that sustained fire damage at one of its sawmills in the third quarter of last year. That said, this customer has implemented plans to recover most of the lost production, and we continue to shift volume to other customers in Japan. As a result, we expect to increase our export volumes into the Japanese market in the first quarter.\nOur domestic sales volumes were lower in the fourth quarter as we shifted volume to China to capture higher-margin opportunities. Per unit log and haul costs were moderately higher and forestry and road costs were seasonally lower. Our fee harvest volumes were slightly lower compared to the third quarter.\nWith that, I'll now turn to fourth quarter business results, starting with Timberlands on Pages 7 through 10 of our earnings slides. Excluding special items, Timberlands contributed $77 million to fourth quarter earnings. Adjusted EBITDA was $143 million and results across all Timberlands regions were comparable to the third quarter. Turning to the Western domestic market, log demand and pricing faced downward pressure at the outset of the fourth quarter as mills adjusted to a softening lumber market and worked through elevated log inventories. As the quarter progressed, lumber takeaway improved slightly and log supply decreased seasonally. Despite lower log prices during the quarter, our average domestic sales realizations were slightly higher compared to the third quarter, largely driven by an increased mix of grade logs.\nAs highlighted on Page 22, we're progressing nicely against our target to grow our timberlands portfolio through $1 billion of disciplined investments between 2022 and 2025. To date, we've deployed approximately $530 million towards our goal, including announced acquisitions in Washington, the Carolinas and Mississippi.\nBefore moving on to business segment results, I'd like to comment briefly on the purchase and sale transactions that we completed in the fourth quarter, which included the acquisition of high-quality timberlands in the Carolinas and Mississippi and the divestiture of less strategic acreage in upstate South Carolina. These transactions represent a unique opportunity to further optimize our Southern Timberlands portfolio with high-quality, highly productive acreage that is well integrated with our existing operations. And these transactions were structured in a tax-efficient like-kind exchange, resulting in a net cash inflow of $7 million. The gain was recorded on the sale transaction and reported as a special item in the fourth quarter.\nAnd given the design of our framework, we retain 20% to 25% of our adjusted FAD annually, all of which can be utilized as we evaluate future capital allocation levers, including strategic growth opportunities. We continue to believe this framework is a powerful differentiator, one that enhances our ability to drive long-term shareholder value by returning meaningful and appropriate amounts of cash back to shareholders across a variety of market conditions and also delivers an attractive total dividend yield to our shareholders.\nAs summarized on Page 20, upon payment of the supplemental dividend, we will have returned $4.6 billion in total cash to shareholders through cash dividends and share repurchase since the first full year of our new cash framework in 2021. It's worth noting that although our adjusted FAD in 2023 was lower than the last couple of years due to challenging market conditions, we continue to demonstrate that our cash return framework is both sustainable and appropriate for the company's portfolio and the cash flow that we generate from our businesses across market cycles. Notably, we increased our base dividend by 5.6% in 2023 and returned additional cash through share repurchase in our supplemental dividend. The additional cash was fully funded within our framework and required no balance sheet or portfolio actions to cover our return commitment.\nAs highlighted on Page 19 of our earnings slides, we generated $986 million of adjusted funds available for distribution in 2023. We announced yesterday that our Board of Directors declared a supplemental cash dividend of $0.14 per share. When combined with our quarterly base dividend of $0.76 per share, we're returning total dividends to shareholders of $0.90 per share. Including $125 million of shares repurchased during the year, Weyerhaeuser is returning $783 million of total cash to shareholders based on 2023 results or approximately 80% of 2023 adjusted FAD, which is at the high end of our annual target payout range.\nI'll start this morning by thanking our employees for their solid execution and performance in 2023. Through their collective efforts, we delivered industry-leading operating performance, continued to serve our customers and drove meaningful advancements across our multiyear targets. As we enter 2024, we're well positioned to capitalize on improving market conditions and remain focused on driving superior long-term value for our shareholders.\nThanks, Andy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Yesterday, Weyerhaeuser reported full year GAAP earnings of $839 million or $1.15 per diluted share on net sales of $7.7 billion. Excluding special items, full year 2023 earnings totaled $749 million or $1.02 per diluted share. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $1.7 billion for the year. For the fourth quarter, we reported GAAP earnings of $219 million or $0.30 per diluted share on net sales of $1.8 billion. Excluding a net after-tax benefit of $98 million for special items, we earned $121 million or $0.16 per diluted share for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $321 million.\n\nAndy Taylor\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nWe will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, and a reconciliation of GAAP can be found in the earnings materials on our website. On the call this morning are Devin Stockfish, Chief Executive Officer; and Davie Wold, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Devin Stockfish.\nThank you, Rob.

[Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce Andy Taylor, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you, Mr. Taylor, you may begin.\n\nAndy Taylor\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss Weyerhaeuser's third quarter 2023 earnings. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. Our earnings release and presentation materials can also be found on our website. Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements, as forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call. We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, and a reconciliation of GAAP can be found in the earnings materials on our website.\nOn the call this morning are Devin Stockfish, Chief Executive Officer; and David Wold, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Devin Stockfish.\n\nDevin W. Stockfish\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Weyerhaeuser Co.\n\nThanks, Andy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Yesterday, Weyerhaeuser reported third quarter GAAP earnings of $239 million or $0.33 per diluted share on net sales of $2 billion. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $509 million, a 9% increase from the second quarter. These are solid results, and I'm proud of the performance delivered by our teams during the quarter. .\nTurning now to our third quarter business results, starting with Timberlands on Pages 6 through 9 of our earnings slides. Timberlands contributed $78 million to third quarter earnings. Adjusted EBITDA was $143 million, a $29 million decrease compared to the second quarter, largely driven by lower sales volumes in our Western and Southern operations and lower average sales realizations for Western export volumes.\nIn the West, adjusted EBITDA decreased by $22 million compared to the second quarter. Turning to the Western domestic market, log supply was ample in the third quarter as the typical seasonal influx of logs from nontraditional timber owners came to market. Despite this dynamic, domestic log markets remain fairly balanced as mills maintained steady demand driven by higher pricing and takeaway of lumber early in the quarter and mills building log inventories to mitigate potential supply risks in the peak of wildfire season.\nOur average domestic sales realizations were comparable to the prior quarter. As expected, during the warmer and drier months, we transitioned to higher elevation and lower productivity harvest operations. Additionally, although wildfire activity was limited on our timberlands, dry conditions across the Pacific Northwest resulted in harvest restrictions in certain areas. As a result, our fee harvest and domestic sales volumes were moderately lower compared to the second quarter. Our forestry and road costs were seasonally higher and per unit log and haul costs were lower.\nMoving to our Western export business. In Japan, elevated inventories of European lumber imports and reduced consumption continued to weigh on the Japanese log market. That said, our average sales realizations for export volumes to Japan were comparable to the second quarter, largely driven by stable log pricing in the Western domestic market. Our Japanese sales volumes decreased in the third quarter. This was partially due to reduced shipments to a customer that sustained fire damage at 1 of its sawmills during the quarter. While the mill is being rebuilt, our customer is in the process of adding shifts in production at different facilities and expects to recover most of the lost production from the damaged operations. It will likely take several quarters for this customer to ramp up the additional production. As a result, we're expecting lower shipments to Japan over the next several quarters. During this period, we expect to shift volume to other customers in Japan and the Western domestic market.\nIn China, despite steady decreases in log inventories at the ports and a reduction in log supply, the Chinese log market continued to be impacted by reduced consumption in the third quarter. As a result, our average sales realizations for export volumes to China decreased moderately compared to the second quarter. While demand for our logs continues to be steady, our sales volumes were significantly lower as we intentionally flex logs to the domestic market to capture higher-margin opportunities.\nTurning to the South. Adjusted EBITDA for Southern Timberlands decreased by $6 million compared to the second quarter. Southern sawlog markets moderated slightly in the third quarter and fiber markets continued to soften, largely in response to elevated mill inventories, a seasonal increase in log supply and reduced demand for finished goods, particularly for pulp and paper products. As a result, our average sales realizations decreased slightly compared to the second quarter. Despite these market dynamics, demand for our logs remained steady, given our delivered programs across the region. However, certain geographies did experience wetter-than-normal conditions at the outset of the quarter, resulting in moderately lower fee harvest volumes compared to the second quarter.\nPer unit log and haul costs were comparable and forestry and road costs were seasonally higher. In the North, adjusted EBITDA increased slightly compared to the second quarter due to significantly higher sales volumes resulting from a seasonal increase in harvest activity that is typical in the third quarter. Our sales realizations were moderately lower due to mix.\nTurning now to real estate, energy and natural resources on Pages 10 and 11. Real estate and ENR contributed $56 million to third quarter earnings. Adjusted EBITDA was $94 million, a $24 million increase compared to the second quarter, largely driven by the timing and mix of properties sold. Average price per acre decreased compared to the second quarter, but remains elevated compared to historical levels, as we continue to benefit from healthy demand for HBU properties, resulting in high-value transactions with significant premiums to timber value.\nI'll now make a few comments on an exciting third quarter achievement in our Natural Climate Solutions business. I'm pleased to report that we received approval from ACR for our first forest carbon credits in Maine. The project covers approximately 50,000 acres has an initial issuance of nearly 32,000 credits and is expected to generate 475,000 credits over a 20-year crediting period. I want to thank our team for the exceptional work and diligence in completing this initial project and building the foundation to scale this business as the market continues to mature. Our goal is to develop and bring to market forest carbon projects that generate meaningful carbon additionality with measurable climate benefits.\nThis initial project is an important milestone for Weyerhaeuser and demonstrates our commitment to offering only the highest quality credits. Looking forward, we are developing several additional forest carbon projects within our U.S. timberlands, including 2 in the South slated for approval in the first half of 2024.\nAs we've demonstrated since launching our Natural Climate Solutions business, Weyerhaeuser is uniquely positioned to lead in this space given our expertise and unmatched Timberlands portfolio. We've established a target to grow this business to $100 million of EBITDA by year-end 2025, and we've made solid progress to date towards that target. And beyond 2025, we see significant upside from natural climate solutions as markets continue to develop, particularly in the carbon and renewables businesses. And from our perspective, there is no other company in this space with the capabilities or asset base to deliver on this value creation opportunity at scale like Weyerhaeuser.\nMoving to Wood Products on Pages 12 through 14. Wood Products generated $277 million of earnings in the third quarter and $328 million of adjusted EBITDA. Third quarter EBITDA was a 21% improvement from the second quarter, largely driven by an increase in OSB sales realizations.\nBefore diving into the business results, I would like to take a moment to highlight the operating performance improvements that we've made in our Wood Products segment over the past several years. To illustrate the point, for the first half of 2023, we delivered peer-leading EBITDA margins across all of our Wood Products businesses. I'm incredibly proud of the work that our teams have done and for their unwavering commitment to our operational excellence initiatives, innovation and the successful delivery of our ongoing strategic capital investments. Through these efforts, we've positioned our Wood Products business to deliver industry-leading performance.\nAs we've demonstrated over the last several years, this has allowed our Wood Products business to generate significant cash flow for Weyerhaeuser. And despite a moderation in product pricing of late, this business remains well positioned to navigate through a range of market conditions and will continue to enhance our competitive advantage as a company, 1 that supports our commitment to returning meaningful amounts of cash to shareholders and enhancing the value of our portfolio over time.\nTurning now to lumber results. Adjusted EBITDA was $58 million in the third quarter, a 14% increase over the prior quarter. Benchmark pricing for lumber entered the third quarter on an upward trajectory, supported by improving demand, relatively lean inventories and the prospect of supply disruption is following an early start to the wildfire season in Canada. By late July, however, demand has softened as supply concerns dissipated and buyer sentiment turned more cautious due to ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty.\nDespite lean inventories, orders were largely limited to necessity purchases throughout the quarter, and benchmark prices trended lower. For the quarter, our average sales realizations were comparable to the second quarter. Our sales volumes were slightly lower resulting from reduced production at several mills, partially driven by temporary operating disruptions. Log costs were moderately lower compared to the second quarter, and unit manufacturing costs were comparable.\nAdjusted EBITDA for OSB increased by $81 million compared to the second quarter, primarily due to the increase in commodity pricing. Benchmark pricing for OSB increased sharply at the outset of the third quarter supported by resilient demand for new home construction activity, lean inventories and supply concerns resulting from annual maintenance outages that are typical in the fall. Pricing remained elevated until mid-September, and then decrease through quarter end as buyer sentiment turned cautious in response to weaker-than-expected housing starts in August as well as general concerns about the economy and the prospect of additional supply coming to market.\nFor the quarter, our average sales realizations increased by 39% compared to the second quarter. Our sales volumes were moderately lower in the quarter. [ Unit ] manufacturing costs were slightly higher due to planned downtime for annual maintenance. Fiber costs improved slightly during the quarter.\nEngineered Wood Products adjusted EBITDA was $125 million, a decrease of $19 million compared to the second quarter. Strong demand for EWP products, which are primarily used in single-family home building applications, kept most of our EWP products on extended lead times for the entire third quarter. As a result, our sales volumes increased slightly compared to the second quarter, primarily for solid section products. Our average sales realizations for most products decreased slightly as supply and demand continue to rebalance in certain markets. It's worth noting that our current EWP prices remain above pre-pandemic levels. Unit manufacturing costs were slightly higher in the third quarter, and raw material costs increased primarily for OSB web stock.\nIn Distribution, adjusted EBITDA was $31 million in the quarter, a $3 million decrease compared to the second quarter, driven by lower EWP realizations in certain markets and lower sales volumes for some products. With that, I'll turn the call over to David to discuss some financial items and our fourth quarter outlook.\n\nDavid M. Wold\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Weyerhaeuser Company\n\nThanks, Devin, and good morning, everyone. I'll be covering key financial items and third quarter financial performance before moving into our fourth quarter outlook. I'll begin with key financial items, which are summarized on Page 16. We generated $523 million of cash from operations in the third quarter and ended the period with approximately $1.8 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, which includes amounts raised in our May debt issuance that prefunded the majority of our 2023 maturities. .\nIn July, we used a portion of the debt issuance proceeds to repay $118 million of notes at maturity. Total debt at quarter end was approximately $5.7 billion, including $860 million that matures in December. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $99 million, which is a typical level for the third quarter and we remain on track to invest approximately $440 million of capital for the full year. We returned $138 million to shareholders through the payment of our quarterly base dividend and remain committed to growing this by 5% annually through 2025. In addition, we returned $25 million to shareholders through share repurchase activity in the third quarter. These shares were repurchased at an average price of $32.67 and as of quarter end, we had completed $733 million of repurchase under our $1 billion authorization.\nLooking forward, we will continue to leverage our flexible cash return framework and look to repurchase shares opportunistically when we believe it will create shareholder value.\nAs highlighted on Page 18, adjusted funds available for distribution for the third quarter totaled $424 million, and we have generated $894 million of adjusted FAD year-to-date. Third quarter results for our unallocated items are summarized on Page 15. Adjusted EBITDA for this segment decreased by $13 million compared to the second quarter. This decrease was primarily attributable to changes in intersegment profit elimination and LIFO.\nLooking forward, key outlook items for the fourth quarter are presented on Page 19. In our Timberlands business, we expect fourth quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA to be comparable to the third quarter of 2023.\nTurning to our Western Timberland operations, we expect log demand in the domestic market to soften in the fourth quarter as mills adjust to lower pricing and takeaway of lumber and work through elevated log inventories. As a result, our domestic sales realizations are expected to be moderately lower compared to the third quarter, absent weather-related log supply disruptions. Our fee harvest volumes in forestry and road costs are expected to be comparable in the fourth quarter and per unit log and haul costs are expected to be moderately higher.\nMoving to the export markets, starting with Japan. As Devin mentioned, we are expecting fewer export shipments into the Japanese market over the next several quarters in response to the operational disruption experienced by 1 of our customers in the region. As a result, we expect fourth quarter sales volumes to be moderately lower compared to the third quarter. Our Japanese log sales realizations are expected to be slightly higher.\nIn China, log supply into the region has adjusted to lower consumption levels and the market is trending toward a more balanced state. As a result, we anticipate fairly stable pricing for our log shipments into China for the balance of the year. For the quarter, our average sales realizations are expected to be slightly lower compared to the third quarter average. Given steady demand for our logs coupled with moderating conditions in the western domestic market, we expect to increase our sales volumes into China in the fourth quarter.\nIn the South, we expect stable log markets in the fourth quarter as mills maintain healthy log inventories ahead of weather conditions that are typical in the winter months. As a result, we expect our sales realizations to be comparable to the third quarter. Our fee harvest volumes and per unit log-in haul costs are also expected to be comparable, and we anticipate seasonally lower forestry and road costs in the fourth quarter.\nIn the North, our fee harvest volumes are expected to be significantly higher compared to the third quarter. We anticipate slightly lower sales realizations due to mix.\nTurning to real estate, energy and natural resources; real estate markets have remained solid year-to-date, and we've capitalized on steady demand and pricing for HBU properties. As a result, we are revising our guidance for full year 2023 adjusted EBITDA to $310 million, an increase of $10 million from prior guidance. We continue to expect basis as a percentage of real estate sales to be 35% to 40% for the year.\nFor the fourth quarter, we expect earnings and adjusted EBITDA to be lower than the third quarter of 2023 due to the timing and mix of real estate sales.\nFor our Wood Products segment, we expect fourth quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be moderately lower compared to the third quarter of 2023 excluding the effects of changes in average sales realizations for lumber and OSB. Benchmark prices for lumber and OSB entered the fourth quarter on a downward trajectory, resulting from cautious buyer sentiment in response to a seasonal reduction in housing construction activity and ongoing macroeconomic headwinds. However, benchmark prices for OSB have stabilized in the last couple of weeks.\nAs shown on Page 20, our current and quarter-to-date average sales realizations for lumber and OSB are lower than the third quarter averages. For our lumber business, we expect moderately higher sales volumes in the fourth quarter and slightly lower unit manufacturing costs. Log costs are expected to be comparable to the third quarter.\nFor our oriented strand board business, we anticipate sales volumes to be moderately higher compared to the third quarter with slightly lower unit manufacturing costs. Fiber costs are expected to be slightly higher in the fourth quarter.\nTurning to our Engineered Wood Products business, as Devin mentioned, we continue to see strong demand for EWP products given resilient single-family construction activity year-to-date. As a result, our order files are extended well into the fourth quarter, and product pricing is expected to be fairly stable through year-end. For the quarter, our average sales realizations are expected to be lower compared to the prior quarter average. Our sales volumes are expected to be slightly lower, primarily for solid section products resulting from an increase in planned downtime for annual maintenance in the fourth quarter. However, we anticipate an increase in sales volumes for I-joist products.\nRaw material costs are expected to be slightly higher compared to the third quarter, primarily for OSB web stock. For our distribution business, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be lower compared to the third quarter, primarily driven by a decrease in commodity realizations. With that, I'll now turn the call back to Devin and look forward to your questions.\n\nDevin W. Stockfish\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Weyerhaeuser Co.\n\nThanks, Davie. Before wrapping up this morning, I'll make a few comments on the housing and repair and remodel markets. Our macro view on the housing market is largely unchanged, although we have seen some recent headwinds in the multifamily segment, in response to increasing interest rates. Importantly, however, the single-family segment has remained resilient year-to-date. In fact, despite the elevated mortgage rate environment, single-family starts increased 3% quarter-over-quarter and new home sales were up in September. As a reminder, single-family construction is a much more important demand driver for our business relative to multifamily. .\nIn the near term, we continue to believe that the underlying housing demand is solid. Even at higher interest rates, we expect single-family demand to hold up reasonably well given the limited inventory of existing homes on the market combined with the homebuilders ability to offer mortgage rate buydowns and other incentives.\nThat said, buyer sentiment will continue to be influenced by affordability challenges brought about by increased mortgage rates and elevated home prices, as well as the state of the overall economy. As a result, we continue to anticipate a choppier housing market in the near term relative to the last couple of years. I will note, however, our long-term view on housing fundamentals continues to be very favorable, supported by strong demographic trends and a vastly underbuilt housing stock.\nTurning to the repair and remodel market. Activity remains steady in the third quarter and has held up well year-to-date, although we're likely to see a seasonal reduction in repair and remodel activity over the winter months, we believe underlying demand fundamentals are solid, supported by prospective homebuyers choosing to remodel in lieu of purchasing a new home in a higher mortgage rate environment. And looking beyond 2023, most of the key drivers supporting healthy repair and remodel demand remain intact including favorable home equity levels and an aging housing stock.\nIn closing, we delivered solid results across our businesses in the third quarter. We also achieved an important milestone in our Natural Climate Solutions growth program with the approval of our first forest carbon credits. And looking ahead, although near-term market conditions have moderated, we remain constructive on the longer-term demand fundamentals that support our businesses. Our balance sheet is exceptionally strong, and we remain focused on maintaining our industry-leading operating performance serving our customers and delivering superior long-term value and returns for our shareholders. With that, I think we can go ahead and open it up for questions."

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Andy Taylor, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you, Mr. Taylor. You may begin.\n\nAndy Taylor\n\nVP of IR, Weyerhaeuser Company\n\nThank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss Weyerhaeuser's third quarter 2022 earnings. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. Our earnings release and presentation materials can also be found on our website. Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation, slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements as forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call. We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, and a reconciliation of GAAP can be found in the earnings materials on our website. On the call this morning is Devin Stockfish, Chief Executive Officer, and Davie Wold, Chief Financial Officer.\nI will now turn the call over to Devin Stockfish.\n\nDevin W. Stockfish\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Weyerhaeuser Company\n\nThanks, Andy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Yesterday, Weyerhaeuser reported third quarter GAAP earnings of $310 million or $0.42 per diluted share on net sales of $2.3 billion. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $583 million in the third quarter. This is approximately 52% lower than the second quarter and was largely driven by further softening in lumber and OSB pricing as cautious sentiment weighed on the near-term housing and macroeconomic outlook.\nAdditionally, and to a lesser degree, third quarter results were also impacted by the work stoppage in our Washington and Oregon wood products and timberlands operations. The work stoppage commenced on September 13 and impacted our 4 lumber mills in the Northwest as well as a portion of our Western Timberlands operations. I'm pleased to report that as of last night, we've resolved the work stoppage, and we'll begin resuming operations next week.\nI want to acknowledge how important these jobs are to our employees, their families and our communities and how difficult this situation has been for all involved. We appreciate everyone who worked diligently over many months to come to an agreement that is fair and competitive for our employees, and importantly, that we believe is sustainable for our company throughout the business cycle.\nWith the work stoppage resolved, we're focused on welcoming our employees back, supporting our customers and returning to full operating capacity in the Northwest as quickly as possible. We currently expect to ramp up to full operating posture over 7 to 10 days after returning to work.\nWith that, I'll now turn to our third quarter business results. I'll begin the discussion with Timberlands on Pages 5 through 8 of our earnings slides. Timberlands contributed $107 million to third quarter earnings. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $168 million; a $3 million increase compared to the year ago quarter. And third quarter EBITDA decreased by $51 million compared to the second quarter. This was largely driven by lower sales volumes in the West, resulting from (inaudible) stoppage late in the quarter as well as lower average realizations in the West, partly due to less export volume being shipped in the quarter.\nTurning to the Western domestic market. Despite lower lumber pricing, log markets remained fairly stable in the third quarter as log demand was steady and log supply in certain areas was somewhat constrained by harvest and haul capacity. Although Weyerhaeuser did not experience these challenges, the impacts kept log markets tension for most of the quarter. As a result, our third quarter domestic sales realizations were comparable to the second quarter.\nNotwithstanding favorable weather conditions, our fee harvest and domestic sales volumes decreased compared to the second quarter as a result of the work stoppage that commenced in mid-September.\nIt's worth noting that our Western log and haul activities are operated by a combination of Weyerhaeuser employees and outside contractors. As a result, a portion of our contract harvest and haul operations continued through the work stoppage. Our forestry and road costs were seasonally higher compared to the second quarter, and per unit log and haul costs were lower.\nTurning to our export markets. In Japan, demand for our logs softened somewhat in the third quarter due to a number of factors, including an increase of European lumber imports into Japan. Japanese log sales volumes decreased significantly compared to the second quarter due to the timing of shipments, combined with the reduction in log export activity resulting from the work stoppage. Sales realizations were slightly lower in the quarter. In China, demand for our logs softened modestly in the third quarter due to the ongoing impacts from disruptions in the Chinese real estate market as well as pandemic-related lockdowns.\nDespite softer demand, log inventories at the Chinese ports declined steadily from the elevated levels reported earlier in the year, as log supply headwinds persisted. These include restrictions on Australian log imports, Russia's ban on log exports and a reduction in European wood flow into China. Average sales realizations for our China export logs decreased moderately compared to the second quarter, and sales volumes were significantly lower as we continue to intentionally shift volume to the domestic market to capture better margin opportunities. Our third quarter sales volumes to China were further impacted by a reduction in log export activity resulting from the work stoppage.\nMoving to the South. Southern Timberlands adjusted EBITDA was comparable to the second quarter and year ago quarter. Despite adequate log supply and softening finished product pricing, Southern sawlog and fiber markets remained stable for the majority of the third quarter as mills maintain steady demand to mitigate risks from ongoing supply chain challenges. As a result, our sales realizations were comparable to the second quarter.\nFee harvest volumes were also comparable as weather conditions were better than expected in certain geographies and affected our harvest activity for a portion of the third quarter.\nForestry and road costs were seasonally higher and per unit log and haul costs were comparable to the second quarter. On the export side, our log exports to China out of the U.S. South remain paused due to ongoing rules imposed by Chinese regulators to address potential phytosanitary concerns on imported pine logs. As a result, we continue to redirect logs to domestic mills in the India market during the third quarter. We continue to view this as a temporary headwind and maintain a positive longer-term outlook for our Southern export business to China and other Asian markets.\nIn the North, adjusted EBITDA increased slightly compared to the second quarter due to significantly higher sales volumes resulting from the seasonal increase in harvest activity that is typical in the third quarter. Our sales realizations were comparable.\nTurning to real estate, energy and natural resources on Pages 9 and 10. Real Estate and ENR contributed $48 million to third quarter earnings and $60 million to adjusted EBITDA. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA was comparable to the year ago quarter, but $47 million lower than the second quarter, primarily due to a reduction in real estate acres sold partially offset by an increase in royalty income from our Energy and Natural Resources business.\nSimilar to recent years, our 2022 real estate activity has been heavily weighted toward the first half of the year. Although activity is moderating in response to broader macroeconomic uncertainty, we continue to see steady demand for HBU properties as buyers continue to seek the safety of hard assets, resulting in high-value transactions with significant premiums to timber value.\nRegarding our Natural Climate Solutions business, we continue to engage with high-quality developers for renewable energy and carbon capture and storage opportunities across our acreage. And we're encouraged by the recent passage of the inflation Reduction Act, which should drive incremental demand for these markets and further support our Natural Climate Solutions growth strategy. Additionally, we continue to advance our forest carbon pilot project in Maine and are well positioned for project approval over the next few months.\nMoving to Wood Products on Pages 11 through 13. Wood Products contributed $344 million to third quarter earnings and $395 million to adjusted EBITDA. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $517 million lower than the second quarter, largely driven by the decrease in lumber and OSB pricing during the quarter.\nStarting with the lumber and OSB markets. Benchmark lumber and OSB prices entered the third quarter having stabilized from significant declines earlier in the year as buyers reentered the market to bolster lean inventories. Buyer sentiment improved slightly following a brief decline in mortgage rates and in response to solid June housing starts data. This dynamic continued through most of July, resulting in a steady increase in benchmark pricing for both products.\nBy early August, buyer sentiment once again turned cautious resulting from rapidly rising mortgage rates, housing affordability concerns and in response to unfavorable July housing starts data. Buyers remain cautious through the end of the quarter, largely limiting orders to necessity purchases. While OSB prices stabilized in September, lumber prices moved gradually lower throughout the end of the quarter.\nAlthough for context, it's important to note that lumber and OSB prices each remained at healthy levels on a historical basis. Adjusted EBITDA for our lumber business decreased by $271 million compared to the second quarter. Our average sales realizations decreased by 28%, while the framing lumber composite pricing decreased by 30%.\nOur sales and production volumes decreased moderately compared to the second quarter largely driven by the impact of the work stoppage at our Washington and Oregon mills. Unit manufacturing costs were higher during the quarter and log costs decreased moderately.\nAdjusted EBITDA for our OSB business decreased by $231 million compared to the second quarter. Our average sales realizations decreased by 41%, while the OSB composite pricing decreased by 44%. Our sales and production volumes decreased slightly compared to the second quarter due to downtime for planned annual maintenance.\nThird quarter sales volumes were further impacted by ongoing rail challenges in Canada. Unit manufacturing costs were higher in the quarter and fiber costs were comparable. Engineering Wood Products adjusted EBITDA decreased by $7 million compared to the second quarter. Sales realizations were higher for most products in the third quarter, and we remained on allocation for most products throughout the quarter. Sales and production volumes were lower for most products due to downtime for planned annual maintenance. Sales volumes were further impacted by ongoing transportation challenges in Canada and labor constraints at certain facilities. Unit manufacturing costs were higher in the third quarter, and raw material costs were significantly lower primarily for OSB web stock.\nIn distribution, adjusted EBITDA decreased by $7 million compared to the second quarter, largely driven by lower sales volumes for EWP and Specialty Products. Despite the quarter-over-quarter reduction, this was the strongest third quarter adjusted EBITDA result on record for our distribution business.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Davie to discuss some financial items and our fourth quarter outlook.\n\nDavid M. Wold\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Weyerhaeuser Company\n\nThank you, Devin, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I will be covering key financial items and third quarter financial performance before moving into our fourth quarter outlook. I'll begin with key financial items, which are summarized on Page 15. We generated approximately $560 million of cash from operations in the third quarter and nearly $2.7 billion year-to-date.\nWe ended the quarter with a strong liquidity position with approximately $1.9 billion of cash and cash equivalents and total debt of just over $5 billion. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $94 million, which is a typical level for the third quarter. We returned $133 million to shareholders through the payment of our quarterly base dividend and remain committed to growing this by 5% annually through 2025.\nWe also returned $145 million to shareholders through share repurchase activity. And as of quarter end, we had $523 million of remaining capacity under our $1 billion share repurchase program. We will continue to leverage our flexible cash return framework and look to repurchase shares opportunistically.\nAdjusted funds available for distribution for the third quarter totaled $468 million, as highlighted on Page 17, and we have generated approximately $2.4 billion of adjusted FAD year-to-date. As a reminder, we will supplement our base dividends each year with an additional return of cash to achieve the targeted annual payout of 75% to 80% of adjusted FAD.\nAs demonstrated in 2021, we have the flexibility in our framework to return this additional cash in the form of a supplemental dividend or a combination of a supplemental dividend and opportunistic share repurchase. While our return of cash for fiscal year 2021 was achieved mostly through base and variable supplemental cash dividends, our share repurchase activity this year has been more active. As a result, we anticipate share repurchase will represent a larger portion of our 75% to 80% of adjusted FAD cash return this year.\nThat said, as a result of the strong cash generation throughout this year, we still expect a meaningful supplemental dividend to be paid in the first quarter of 2023.\nKey outlook items for the fourth quarter are presented on Page 18. As Devin mentioned, we will soon be returning to normal operating levels in our Washington and Oregon lumber and Timberlands businesses. That said, our fourth quarter outlook includes work stoppage impacts through October, followed by a 7- to 10-day ramp-up period to return to full operating capacity. In our Timberlands business, we expect fourth quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be significantly lower than the third quarter.\nTurning to our Western Timberlands operations. Domestic log demand softened at the outset of the fourth quarter, resulting from reduced takeaway of finished products and elevated log inventories at mills. Regional log supply has improved from the prior quarter and is expected to remain ample for the majority of the fourth quarter, notwithstanding adverse weather conditions or supply chain constraints. As a result, we expect our domestic log sales realizations to be significantly lower compared to the third quarter.\nOur fee harvest and domestic sales volumes are expected to be lower in the fourth quarter largely driven by impacts of the work stoppage, and we now anticipate our full year harvest volumes in the West to be slightly lower than 2021. This reduction in volumes from prior guidance represents a harvest deferral that we expect to capture over several quarters after returning to normal operations.\nPer unit log and haul costs are expected to be lower in the fourth quarter. Forestry and road costs are expected to be significantly lower due to the seasonal nature of these activities.\nMoving to the export markets, we expect steady demand for our logs in the fourth quarter. As Devin mentioned, the work stoppage resulted in a temporary reduction in our log export activity. As a result, we expect lower export sales volumes compared to the third quarter. Additionally, we anticipate sales realizations for our export logs to be lower in the fourth quarter. In the South, we expect log demand to remain steady in the fourth quarter as mills continue to maintain elevated inventories to mitigate risks from ongoing supply chain and logistics challenges.\nAs a result, we expect our sales realizations to be comparable to the third quarter. Fee harvest volumes are expected to be slightly higher as weather conditions have improved from the prior quarter. Because of better-than-expected weather conditions in the third quarter, we now anticipate our full year harvest volumes in the South to be slightly higher than 2021 compared to our prior outlook of moderately higher volumes. We expect slightly higher forestry and road costs in the fourth quarter and comparable per unit log and haul costs. In the North, fee harvest volumes are expected to be moderately higher compared to the third quarter. We anticipate significantly lower sales realizations due to mix. Turning to our Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources segment. We expect fourth quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be lower than the third quarter due to timing and mix of real estate sales and lower royalty income in our Energy and natural resources business. We continue to anticipate full year 2022 adjusted EBITDA of approximately $325 million, and we now expect basis as a percentage of real estate sales to be approximately 35% to 40% for the full year.\nFor our Wood Products segment, we expect fourth quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be lower than the third quarter, excluding the effects of changes in average sales realizations for lumber and oriented strand board. Following the reduction in pricing during the third quarter, benchmark prices for lumber and OSB entered the fourth quarter showing signs of stabilization.\nBuyers are maintaining inventories at or below target levels as sentiment remains cautious. In October, benchmark prices for lumber continued on a slight downward trajectory for the majority of the month before stabilizing and increasing slightly. Benchmark prices for OSB have remained fairly stable through October.\nAs shown on Page 20, for both lumber and OSB, our current and quarter-to-date realizations are moderately lower than the third quarter averages. For our lumber business, we expect significantly lower log costs in the fourth quarter, partially offset by lower sales volumes resulting from the work stoppage in our Western mills in October, and we anticipate comparable unit manufacturing costs.\nFor our oriented strand board business, we expect slightly higher sales volumes and significantly lower unit manufacturing costs, primarily due to less downtime for planned annual maintenance during the fourth quarter. Fiber costs are expected to be comparable to the third quarter.\nFor our Engineered Wood Products business, we expect lower sales volumes in the fourth quarter. We also expect lower sales realizations for most products compared to the third quarter with solid section and I-joists pricing coming off record highs. This will be partially offset by significantly lower raw material costs, primarily for OSB web stock.\nAs a result, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be lower in the fourth quarter, but still higher than any quarter in 2021. For our distribution business, we are expecting adjusted EBITDA to be lower than the third quarter due to lower sales volumes and realizations for most products.\nI'll now turn the call back to Devin and look forward to your questions.\n\nDevin W. Stockfish\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Weyerhaeuser Company\n\nThanks, Davie. Before wrapping up this morning, I'll make a few comments on the housing and repair and remodel markets. Over the last several months, we've continued to see softening in new residential construction activity from the peak reported in April, particularly in the single-family segment.\nThere have been notable reductions in new and existing home sales and home builder sentiment has turned more negative. Consequently, we expect near-term housing outlook to remain less favorable compared to the last couple of years, largely driven by several ongoing headwinds, including a rapid increase in mortgage rates, housing affordability challenges, high inflation and growing concerns about the economy.\nThat all being said, homebuilder backlog should offer some additional support for building activity and wood products demand for the remainder of 2022 and into early 2023. And longer term, we continue to have a favorable view on housing fundamentals, given strong demographic trends, a significantly underbuilt housing stock, a healthy labor market and solid household balance sheets.\nTurning to repair and remodel. Despite softening in the housing market, repair and remodel activity remained fairly stable in the third quarter and continue to be supported by steady demand from the professional segment. Demand from the do-it-yourself segment has continued to come off the recent pandemic peaks returning to a more normalized pre-pandemic demand level. Although lower home sales activity ordinarily would be a drag on repair and remodel spending, we may, in fact, see some incremental spend on repair and remodel projects as homeowners elect to invest in remodeling projects in their existing homes if they're priced out of purchasing a new home in this more challenged mortgage rate environment. This should provide near-term support for additional repair and remodel activity, especially from the professional segment.\nFurther, we remain optimistic on longer-term fundamentals supporting the repair and remodel segment, including an aging housing stock and favorable home equity levels. We expect these dynamics to support steady repair and demand for the balance of 2022 and into next year with activity levels comparable to pre-pandemic levels.\nIn closing, we delivered solid results across our businesses in the third quarter despite increasing macroeconomic headwinds. And I'm incredibly proud of the continued focus and resiliency demonstrated by our teams. Their collective efforts have generated year-to-date adjusted EBITDA of $3.3 billion and adjusted funds available for distribution of $2.4 billion.\nAlthough near-term market conditions have moderated, we maintain a constructive longer-term outlook for the demand fundamentals that support our businesses. Looking forward, our balance sheet is exceptionally strong. We have a competitive cost structure, and we are very well positioned to navigate through a full range of market conditions. We remain focused on serving our customers and driving long-term value for our shareholders through an unmatched portfolio of assets, industry-leading performance and disciplined capital allocation.\nNow before we move to questions, I would like to briefly provide some details to help quantify the work stoppage impacts to our third quarter results and fourth quarter outlook. I'm sure that would have been a question, so we'll just go ahead and cover that now.\nStarting with Timberlands, it is important to note that the decrease in volume during this period is merely deferred, not lost. We will capture this deferred volume over the next year or so. And in the meantime, that volume will continue to grow on the stump. Additionally, I'd point out that in any given period, we have a base level of spend for items such as forestry, silviculture and roads that we maintain to ensure that we capture long-term value. So we've continued to incur those costs during the course of the work stoppage, which means our margins will be significantly lower during this period, but margins will then increase above typical levels in the future period when we ultimately harvest that volume.\nTaking all of that into consideration, the work stoppage resulted in approximately 360,000 tons of deferred volumes in the third quarter compared to our original plan. This translated to an EBITDA impact of approximately $25 million. But again, most of that will be recovered in future periods when the deferred log volume is harvested next year.\nLooking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect Western Timberlands EBITDA will decrease by approximately $50 million from the third quarter, with approximately half of that decrease attributable to deferred volume from the work stoppage and the other half due to expected lower average sales realizations during the quarter due to general market conditions. We expect approximately 500,000 tons of deferred volumes in the fourth quarter resulting from the work stoppage.\nFor Wood Products, the work stoppage lowered production volumes by approximately 60 million board feet in the third quarter, and we expect around 170 million board feet of impact in the fourth quarter. Given the more rapid pace of price erosion in lumber versus logs in the West, which compresses margins until log prices adjust accordingly, the last lumber production in September and October hasn't had a material impact on EBITDA in the third or fourth quarters.\nSo with that, I think we can go ahead and open it up for questions."

(Operator Instructions)\nAs a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce Andy Taylor, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, Mr. Taylor. You may begin.\n\nAndy Taylor\n\nThank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss Weyerhaeuser's first quarter 2022 earnings. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. Our earnings release and presentation materials can also be found on our website. Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements as forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call.\nWe will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, and a reconciliation to GAAP can be found in the earnings materials on our website. On the call this morning are Devin Stockfish, Chief Executive Officer; and Nancy Loewe, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Devin Stockfish.\n\nDevin W. Stockfish\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Weyerhaeuser Company\n\nThanks, Andy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. This morning, Weyerhaeuser reported first quarter GAAP earnings of $771 million or $1.03 per diluted share on net sales of $3.1 billion. Excluding special items relating to our debt refinancing actions, we earned $978 million or $1.31 per diluted share.\nOur employees once again delivered phenomenal operational and financial results in the quarter, notwithstanding persistent supply chain, transportation and pandemic-related disruptions. Their collective efforts helped the company achieve its strongest first quarter adjusted EBITDA on record at $1.5 billion. This represents a 122% increase over the fourth quarter of 2021.\nTurning now to our first quarter business results. I'll begin the discussion with Timberlands, on Pages 6 through 9 of our earnings slides. Timberlands contributed $182 million to first quarter earnings. Adjusted EBITDA increased by $71 million compared to the fourth quarter. In the West, adjusted EBITDA increased by 77% compared to the fourth quarter. Western domestic log markets were favorable through the first quarter, driven by strong demand as mills sought to capitalize on unseasonably high lumber prices. As a result, our domestic sales realizations were significantly higher compared to the fourth quarter.\nOverall log supply in the Western system was plentiful during the quarter due to favorable weather conditions as well as increased volumes from other landowners in response to strong log pricing. This drove log inventories at the mills to above target levels by the end of the quarter, particularly in Oregon. Our fee harvest volumes were significantly higher compared to the fourth quarter and per unit log and haul costs were lower as we made the seasonal transition to lower elevation and lower-cost harvest operations.\nForestry and road costs were seasonally lower in the quarter. Turning to our export markets. In Japan, demand for our logs remained strong in the first quarter. High North American lumber prices combined with global logistics challenges, particularly with respect to port congestion and shipping container shortages continued to limit the availability of imported lumber into Japan. These dynamics are driving strong demand for our customers locally produced lumber in Japan and increased demand for our imported logs.\nAs a result, our Japanese log sales realizations in the first quarter increased significantly compared to the fourth quarter. Sales volumes were slightly lower due to the timing of vessels. The Russia-Ukraine conflict did not have a material impact on our log export business into Japan during the first quarter. However, we do ultimately expect a reduction in Russian and European wood supply into Japan as a result of the conflict, which will likely bolster demand for our log exports into the Japanese market over time.\nIn China, log inventories at the ports have remained elevated coming out of the Lunar New Year, and we're seeing lower takeaway as a result of ongoing pandemic-related disruptions in the country. Notwithstanding these headwinds, end-market demand for our Western logs remained favorable in the quarter due largely to supply disruptions into China. Imports of lumber and logs into China continued to be impacted by global logistical challenges, port congestion and restrictions on imported Australian logs.\nImports were further constrained in the first quarter as Russia commenced its previously announced ban on log exports. And later in the quarter, European log supply was also disrupted by the Russia-Ukraine conflict. As a result, our sales realizations for China export logs increased slightly in the quarter. Our sales volumes to China, however, decreased significantly as we intentionally shifted volume to the domestic market to support our domestic customers and capitalize on strong Western log prices.\nMoving to the South. Southern Timberlands adjusted EBITDA was comparable to the fourth quarter. Notwithstanding ample log supply and improving log inventories as the quarter progressed, Southern sawlog markets remained favorable in the first quarter as mills sought to benefit from the strong lumber and panel pricing environment. Fiber markets were also favorable as mills bolstered inventories from the lean levels experienced at the outset of the quarter.\nAs a result, our sales realizations increased slightly compared to the fourth quarter. Our fee harvest volumes in forestry and road costs were seasonally lower in the first quarter, and per unit log and haul costs were moderately higher, primarily for fuel-related transportation costs. Regarding our Southern export business, our log exports to China remain temporarily paused as a result of recently adopted and fairly restrictive rules implemented by Chinese regulators to address potential phytosanitary concerns on imported pine logs.\nIn response, we continue to redirect logs to domestic mills and the India export market during the first quarter. We continue to maintain a constructive longer-term outlook for our Southern export business to China and other Asian markets. In the North, adjusted EBITDA increased by $1 million compared to the fourth quarter due to improved sales realizations across all products. Fee harvest volumes were seasonally lower in the first quarter.\nTurning to Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources on Pages 10 and 11. Real estate and ENR contributed $81 million to first quarter earnings and $116 million to adjusted EBITDA. First quarter adjusted EBITDA was $67 million higher than the fourth quarter due to the timing of real estate transactions.\nSimilar to the last few years, our real estate activities in 2022 are more heavily weighted toward the first half of the year. Average price per acre decreased compared to the fourth quarter due to the mix of properties sold but remains elevated compared to historical levels as we continue to benefit from strong demand for HBU properties, resulting in high-value transactions with significant premiums to timber value.\nNow for a few comments on our Natural Climate Solutions business. In March, we announced an agreement with Oxy Low Carbon Ventures to pursue our first carbon capture and storage project. This partnership combines more than 30,000 acres of Weyerhaeuser's uniquely positioned subsurface ownership in Louisiana with Oxy's proven technical expertise in the management and sequestration of carbon dioxide. It will take several years to bring this project into production, and we expect that will come online in 2025 or 2026.\nThis project represents an important milestone in our previously announced plan to grow our Natural Climate Solutions business. We expect to announce additional carbon capture and storage agreements as we continue to advance discussions with high-quality developers on portions of our Southern U.S. acreage.\nMoving now to Wood Products on Pages 12 through 14. Wood Products contributed $1.2 billion to first quarter earnings. Adjusted EBITDA increased by $716 million compared to the fourth quarter, a 138% improvement. This represents the second highest quarterly adjusted EBITDA on record for our Wood Products business. These are exceptional results considering the ongoing transportation and supply chain headwinds faced by our teams in the first quarter.\nI want to specifically recognize our supply chain and logistics teams for their continued focus and resolve while navigating these challenges. Starting with lumber and OSB markets, benchmark lumber and OSB prices entered the quarter on an upward trajectory as demand for homebuilding and repair and remodel remained favorable and supply constraints persisted due to supply, transportation and labor-related challenges in addition to winter weather disruptions.\nThis dynamic continued for most of the quarter, driving lumber and OSB prices once again to near record high levels. Demand softened somewhat late in the quarter as many buyers paused to assess downside risk with elevated price levels and to evaluate the potential impacts of rising mortgage rates on the housing market. Lower-than-expected take away from home centers also impacted demand to some extent in the quarter.\nDespite generally lean inventories heading into the spring building season, buyers remained cautious through the end of the quarter, with the reluctance to build meaningful inventory in a dynamic pricing environment. As a result, lumber and OSB prices peaked and started on a downward trajectory in March. Adjusted EBITDA for our lumber business increased by $453 million compared to the fourth quarter, a 232% improvement.\nOur average sales realizations increased by 76% in the first quarter, while the framing lumber composite pricing increased by 81%. Production volumes increased moderately, resulting from less planned downtime and weather-related downtime. Sales volumes were slightly lower, driven by ongoing transportation challenges. This dynamic resulted in an expansion of inventory levels during the quarter.\nLog costs were significantly higher, primarily for Western logs. Adjusted EBITDA for our OSB business increased by $216 million compared to the fourth quarter, a 123% improvement. Our average sales realizations increased by 61% in the first quarter while the OSB composite pricing increased by 94%. This relative difference was largely a result of extended order files that lag surging OSB prices and shipping delays due to transportation disruptions primarily in Canada. Our production volumes improved slightly in the first quarter, resulting from less downtime for planned maintenance.\nAs a result, sales volumes increased moderately compared to the fourth quarter notwithstanding significant transportation headwinds in Canada in January and February. Unit manufacturing costs were slightly higher in the quarter and fiber costs were significantly higher. Engineered Wood Products adjusted EBITDA increased by $22 million compared to the fourth quarter, surpassing last quarter's record by 19%.\nSales realizations improved in the first quarter and we benefited from previously announced price increases for solid section and I-Joist products. This was partially offset by moderately higher raw material costs, primarily for OSB web stock and resin.\nProduction volumes were moderately lower for solid section and I-Joist products driven in large part by tight veneer supply and pandemic-related staffing challenges early in the quarter. As a result, sales volumes were comparable to the fourth quarter. In Distribution, adjusted EBITDA increased by $32 million compared to the fourth quarter, an 80% improvement as the business experienced strong demand and captured improved margins across all products.\nBefore turning the call over to Nancy, I'd like to comment briefly on an exciting growth opportunity within our Southern Timberlands business. Earlier this month, we announced an agreement to acquire approximately 81,000 acres of high-quality timberlands in North and South Carolina for approximately $265 million. This is a unique opportunity to enhance our portfolio with highly productive and well-managed timberlands, which are located in some of the best coastal markets in the U.S. South and strategically positioned to deliver operational synergies with our existing timber and mill footprint.\nThis acquisition offers extremely attractive timberland attributes and is expected to deliver portfolio leading cash flow and harvest tons per acre within our Southern Timberlands business. Additionally, we expect to capture incremental benefits from real estate and natural climate solutions opportunities over time. The transaction is expected to close later in the quarter and represents an exciting milestone in our multiyear strategy to grow the value of our Timberland portfolio through disciplined investments.\nSo with that, I'll turn the call over to Nancy to discuss some financial items and our second quarter outlook.\n\nNancy S. Loewe\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Weyerhaeuser Company\n\nThank you, Devin, and good morning, everyone. I'll be covering key financial items and first quarter financial performance before moving into our second quarter outlook. I'll begin with key financial items, which are summarized on Page 16. We generated $957 million of cash from operations in the first quarter. This is an increase of over $460 million from the fourth quarter and is our highest first quarter operating cash flow on record. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.2 billion of cash and cash equivalents and total debt of $5.1 billion.\nAt the end of February, we initiated a series of transactions to further enhance our strong financial position by effectively refinancing $900 million of debt. This included the issuance of $450 million of notes due in 2033, with [3.375%]coupon and $450 million of notes due in 2052 with a 4% coupon.\nThe net proceeds plus cash on hand were then used to close cash tender offers for $931 million of principal on notes with considerably higher rates. We incurred a net after-tax charge of $207 million related to premiums and unamortized debt issuance cost and debt discount in connection with the early debt repayments, which is included in our first quarter as a -- results as a special item. These actions enabled us to capitalize on favorable interest rates prior to the most recent increase by the Fed, resulting in a meaningful reduction in the weighted average coupon in our debt portfolio while also smoothing and extending the weighted average maturity.\nOverall, our annualized interest savings will be approximately $38 million. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $70 million, which is typical in the first quarter. We returned $121 million to shareholders through share repurchase activity. These shares were repurchased at an average price of $37.87. And as of quarter end, we had approximately $800 million of remaining capacity under our $1 billion share repurchase program.\nWe will continue to leverage our flexible cash return framework and look to repurchase shares opportunistically when we believe it will create shareholder value. We also returned $134 million to shareholders through the payment of our quarterly base dividend which was increased by 5.9% to $0.18 per share during the quarter. This is in line with our commitment to grow our sustainable base dividend by 5% annually through 2025.\nAdjusted FAD for the first quarter totaled $850 million, as highlighted on Page 18. As a reminder, we will supplement our base dividends each year with an additional return of cash to achieve the targeted annual payout of 75% to 80% of adjusted FAD. As demonstrated in 2021, we have the flexibility in our framework to return this additional cash in the form of a supplemental dividend or a combination of a supplemental dividend and opportunistic share repurchase.\nFirst quarter results for our unallocated items are summarized on Page 15. Adjusted EBITDA for this segment decreased by $31 million compared to the fourth quarter. This decline was primarily attributable to a $59 million noncash charge for the elimination of intersegment profit in inventory and LIFO in the first quarter due to the elevated levels of high-value inventory.\nAs seasonal inventory levels are reduced in the second quarter, we do expect to record a noncash benefit for the elimination of intersegment profit in inventory and LIFO. Looking forward, key outlook items for the second quarter are presented on Page 19. In our Timberlands business, we expect second quarter earnings before special items and adjusted EBITDA will be significantly lower than the first quarter but still higher than any other quarter since the fourth quarter of 2018.\nTurning to the Western Timberlands operations. Domestic log demand softened somewhat at the outset of the second quarter in response to ample log supply, elevated mill inventories and reduced takeaway of finished products as lumber prices retreated from historically high levels. As a result, we expect our domestic sales realizations to be lower in the second quarter, but still substantially higher than any quarter in 2021.\nForestry and road costs are expected to be significantly higher as we enter the spring and summer months, and per unit log and haul costs are also expected to increase. We anticipate our fee harvest volumes will be comparable to the first quarter. Moving to the export markets, in Japan, demand for our logs remained strong as imported lumber continues to be restricted by global shipping challenges and more recently, in response to wood flow disruptions, resulting from the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. As a result, our Japanese sales volumes are expected to increase significantly compared to the first quarter.\nWe anticipate our second quarter sales realizations to be comparable to the strong levels experienced in the first quarter. In China, despite elevated log inventories at the ports, demand for our logs remains favorable as imports of lumber and logs from other countries continue to be constrained. As a result, our sales realizations on log imports into China are expected to be slightly higher compared to the first quarter.\nWe anticipate our sales volumes to be significantly lower as we continue to flex logs to our domestic customers to capture the highest margin. In the South, despite the pullback in lumber and OSB pricing at the outset of the quarter and a seasonal increase of log supply, log demand remains stable as mills maintain elevated inventories to mitigate risk from ongoing transportation challenges. As a result, we expect our sales realizations to be comparable to the first quarter. We anticipate our fee harvest volumes will be moderately higher as seasonal weather patterns transition to drier conditions.\nSimilar to the West, forestry and road costs are expected to be significantly higher as we enter the spring and summer months, and we anticipate moderately higher per unit log and haul costs. In the North, due to product mix, sales realizations are expected to be significantly higher than the first quarter, while fee harvest volumes are expected to be significantly lower as we enter the spring breakup season.\nTurning to our Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources segment. Real estate markets remained strong heading into the second quarter and we continue to anticipate a consistent flow of HBU transactions with significant premiums to timber value. For the second quarter, we expect net earnings will be comparable to an adjusted EBITDA will be slightly higher than the second quarter of 2021. We expect an increase in acres sold and a higher basis year-over-year due to the mix of properties we anticipate to sell. For our Wood Products segment, we expect second quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be higher than the first quarter, excluding the effect of changes in average sales realizations for lumber and OSB.\nDemand for our products remain favorable heading into the spring building season, supported by strong new residential construction and professional repair and remodel activity. As Devin mentioned, supply continues to be constrained by transportation challenges and inventories through the channel remain lean. Despite these dynamics, benchmark pricing for lumber and oriented strand board entered the second quarter on a rapid downward trajectory as buyers continue to assess downside risk of elevated price levels and we're reluctant to build inventories in this dynamic pricing environment.\nBy late April, benchmark pricing for both products stabilized as buyers took steps to replenish inventories to prepare for the spring building season. As shown on Page 20, for lumber, our current and quarter-to-date realizations are significantly lower than the first quarter average. For OSB, our current realizations are comparable and quarter-to-date realizations remain higher than the first quarter average due to the length of our order files.\nFor our lumber business, we expect improved production volumes and moderately lower unit manufacturing costs in the second quarter. Sales volumes are expected to improve significantly with increased production as well as higher seasonal inventory drawdown. We anticipate moderately lower log costs compared to the first quarter, primarily for Western logs. For our OSB business, we expect moderately higher sales volumes compared to the first quarter, resulting from higher production volumes and improving transportation networks, primarily in Canada.\nUnit manufacturing costs are expected to be slightly lower and fiber costs are expected to be comparable. For our engineered wood products business, as we continue to capture the benefit of price increases announced in February, we expect higher sales realizations for our solid section and I-Joist products. We anticipate this will be completely offset by significantly lower sales realization for our plywood products. Our sales and production volumes are expected to be significantly higher in the second quarter as veneer supply continues to improve. We anticipate this will be partially offset by significantly higher raw material costs primarily for OSB web stock.\nAnd for our distribution business, we're expecting adjusted EBITDA to be significantly lower than the first quarter, primarily due to reduced commodity margins. And with that, I'll now turn the call back to Devin and look forward to your questions.\n\nDevin W. Stockfish\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Weyerhaeuser Company\n\nThanks, Nancy. Before wrapping up this morning, I'll make a few comments on the housing and repair and remodel markets. First quarter housing starts averaged 1.75 million units on a seasonally adjusted basis, an improvement of 5% over the fourth quarter. Activity dipped slightly in January, driven by winter weather and pandemic-related labor challenges, but improved as the quarter progressed. March housing starts totaled nearly 1.8 million units on a seasonally adjusted basis, the highest monthly level since 2006. Housing permits in the first quarter averaged nearly 1.9 million units on a seasonally adjusted basis, surpassing last quarter by 7% and surging to its highest quarterly average since before the Great Recession.\nAlthough these results demonstrate strong underlying demand for new home construction, the cycle time between starts and completions continues to be extended as homebuilders face ongoing supply chain disruptions, labor availability challenges and rising material costs. Additionally, we do expect increasing mortgage rates and higher inflation to have some impact on the housing market.\nHowever, notwithstanding these headwinds, our customers continue to see strong demand and remain optimistic for new home construction in 2022, and we remain constructive on near-term and longer-term housing demand fundamentals given favorable demographic trends, a significantly underbuilt housing stock, a strong labor market and elevated household balance sheets.\nTurning to repair and remodel. We continue to see favorable activity from large professional projects in the first quarter, representing a continuation of the strong demand signal we saw from this segment in 2021. Demand from the Do-It-Yourself segment softened modestly in the first quarter, largely driven by concerns over the return of near record high lumber prices. Overall, our long-term outlook for repair and remodel continues to be favorable, supported by an aging housing stock, rising home equity and historically low supply of new and existing homes for sale.\nIn closing, we delivered our strongest first quarter financial performance on record and I'm incredibly proud of our employees for their continued dedication and resilience. We continue to make meaningful progress towards the multiyear growth targets we announced at our Investor Day last September and remain committed to serving our customers and delivering industry-leading performance across our operations.\nOur balance sheet is strong. And with $850 million of adjusted FAD generated in the first quarter, 2022 is off to a great start. We believe the company is well positioned to deliver considerable long-term value and superior returns for our shareholders.\nWith that, I think we can go ahead and open it up for questions."

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\nIt is now my pleasure to introduce Andy Taylor, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. Mr. Taylor, you may begin.\n\nAndy Taylor\n\nVP of IR, Weyerhaeuser Company\n\nThank you, Melissa. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss Weyerhaeuser's fourth quarter 2022 earnings. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. Our earnings release and presentation materials can also be found on our website.\nPlease review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements as forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call. We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP can be found in the earnings materials on our website.\nOn the call this morning are Devin Stockfish, Chief Executive Officer; and Davie Wold, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Devin Stockfish.\n\nDevin W. Stockfish\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Weyerhaeuser Company\n\nThanks, Andy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Yesterday, Weyerhaeuser reported full year GAAP earnings of $1.9 billion or $2.53 per diluted share on net sales of $10.2 billion. Excluding special items, our full year 2022 earnings totaled $2.2 billion or $3.02 per diluted share. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $3.7 billion for the year.\nFor the fourth quarter, we reported GAAP earnings of $11 million or $0.02 per diluted share on net sales of $1.8 billion. Excluding an after-tax charge of $160 million for the special items, we earned $171 million or $0.24 per diluted share for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $369 million. This is a 37% decrease from the third quarter and was largely driven by further softening in Wood Products markets as cautious sentiment continued to weigh on the near-term housing and macroeconomic outlook.\nI'll begin this morning by expressing my appreciation to our employees for their strong execution and performance in 2022. Notwithstanding a number of supply chain disruptions and dynamic market conditions over the course of the year, our teams operated safely, continue to serve our customers and drove meaningful improvements across our businesses. Through their efforts, we delivered our second highest annual adjusted EBITDA on record and are well positioned to navigate a more challenged market environment entering 2023.\nAdditionally, as highlighted on Page 20 of our earnings slides, we generated more than $2.3 billion of adjusted funds available for distribution in 2022, again, demonstrating strong cash generation capability in combining our unmatched portfolio of assets with industry-leading operating performance.\nWe announced yesterday that our Board of Directors declared a supplemental cash dividend of $0.90 per share, payable on February 27 to holders of record on February 15. When combined with our quarterly base dividend of $0.72 per share, we're returning total dividends to shareholders of $1.62 per share, including $550 million of shares repurchased during the year, Weyerhaeuser is returning $1.75 billion of total cash to shareholders based on 2022 results or 75% of 2022 adjusted FAD, which is in line with our annual targeted payout range of 75% to 80%.\nAs summarized on Page 21. We've now completed the second full year of our new cash return framework. Upon payment of the supplemental dividend, we will returned more than $3.8 billion in total cash to shareholders based on 2021 and 2022 results through a combination of cash dividends and share repurchase. We continue to believe this framework will enhance our ability to drive long-term shareholder value by returning meaningful and appropriate amounts of cash back to shareholders across a range of market conditions and deliver an attractive total dividend yield to our shareholders.\nMoving forward into 2023, our cash return commitment will continue to be supported by our sustainable quarterly base dividend which we intend to grow by 5% annually through 2025, as outlined in our cash return framework on Page 19, we plan to supplement our base dividend with an additional return of cash as appropriate to achieve our targeted annual payout of 75% to 80% of adjusted FAD. And as demonstrated in 2021 and 2022, we have the flexibility in our framework to return this additional cash in the form of a supplemental cash dividend or opportunistic share repurchase.\nWith that, I'll now turn to our fourth quarter business results. I'll begin with Timberlands on Pages 7 through 10 of our earnings slides. Timberlands contributed $86 million to fourth quarter earnings. Adjusted EBITDA was $150 million, an $18 million decrease compared to the third quarter. This was largely driven by lower sales realizations in the West. For the full year, Timberlands' adjusted EBITDA increased by 13% compared to 2021. These were strong results, and I am extremely proud of the focus and resiliency demonstrated by our teams in 2022.\nTurning to our Western Timberlands operations. Domestic log markets softened at the outset of the fourth quarter, driven primarily by lower lumber pricing and ample log supply in the system. This drove domestic log pricing to lower levels early in the quarter. As the quarter progressed, log supply into the market became more constrained, resulting from a seasonal reduction in log availability. This dynamic resulted in a temporary period of log price stability into December.\nFor the quarter, our average domestic realizations were moderately lower than the third quarter. Our fee harvest and domestic sales volumes were higher as the business quickly returned to full run rate operations following the resolution of our work stoppage. We plan to capture the majority of the deferred harvest volume from the work stoppage in 2023. Forestry and road costs were seasonally lower compared to the third quarter, and per unit log and haul costs were comparable.\nTurning to our export markets. In Japan, demand for our logs was strong in the fourth quarter as our key customers sought to replenish lean inventories resulting from our work stoppage. That said, our export sales volumes to Japan were slightly lower as work stoppage-related impacts to our export program were disproportionately higher in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter. Our average sales realizations were significantly lower as broader log markets soften in Japan due primarily to an oversupply of European lumber imports as well as lower consumption driven by reduced housing activity. Log demand from our China customers was solid in the fourth quarter, and our export sales volumes increased significantly compared to the lower levels in the third quarter when we intentionally kept more volume in the domestic market to capture higher-margin opportunities.\nOur average sales realizations were significantly lower in the fourth quarter as broader Chinese log market softened due to lower consumption resulting from COVID disruptions and challenges in the Chinese real estate market.\nMoving to the South. Southern Timberlands adjusted EBITDA increased slightly compared to the third quarter. Similar to the last several quarters, notwithstanding adequate log supply and softening finished product pricing, Southern sawlog and fiber markets remained fairly stable during the fourth quarter. Log demand was steady as mills continue to carry higher inventory levels to mitigate potential risks from supply chain and weather challenges.\nAs a result, our sales realizations were comparable to the third quarter. Fee harvest volumes were slightly higher as weather conditions remained generally favorable for most of the quarter. Forestry and road costs decreased slightly and per unit log and haul costs were comparable to the third quarter.\nOn the export side, our Southern program to China remains paused due to ongoing phytosanitary rules imposed by Chinese regulators. While it's unclear when this issue will be resolved, we continue to have a positive longer-term outlook for our Southern export business to China. And in the interim, we will continue to grow our export business into India and other Asian markets.\nIn the North, adjusted EBITDA increased slightly compared to the third quarter due to significantly higher sales volumes as weather conditions were favorable. Our sales realizations decreased moderately.\nTurning to Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources on Pages 11 and 12. For the full year, Real Estate ENR generated $329 million of adjusted EBITDA. Slightly higher than our revised full year guidance and 11% higher than 2021. This was driven primarily by exceptionally strong demand for HBU properties in 2022, as well as robust energy and natural resources activity for much of the year.\nIn the fourth quarter, the segment contributed $24 million to earnings, excluding a $10 million noncash impairment charge resulting from the planned divestiture of legacy coal assets, the segment earned $34 million in the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $46 million, a decrease of $14 million from the prior quarter, primarily due to a reduction in real estate acres sold. Although HBU demand has moderated somewhat in response to broader macroeconomic concerns, we continue to see steady interest from buyers seeking the safety of hard assets in an inflationary environment.\nNotably, we delivered our highest average price per acre for all of 2022 on our land sales in the fourth quarter. These are high-value transactions with significant premiums to timber value.\nI'll now make a few comments on our Natural Climate Solutions business. As shown on Page 13, full year adjusted EBITDA from this business was $43 million, a 13% increase compared to 2021. Growth during the year was primarily driven by conservation activity with ongoing contributions from our mitigation banking and renewable energy businesses. In addition, we achieved notable milestones in our emerging carbon businesses in 2022, including the announcement of our first 2 Carbon Capture and Storage agreements, one of which was announced in the fourth quarter in partnership with Denbury.\nSimilar to our agreement with Oxy Low Carbon Ventures announced earlier in 2022, the Denbury project will take several years to begin production, and we expect both projects will come online in 2025 or 2026.\nMoving forward, we continue to advance discussions with high-quality developers of Carbon Capture and Storage on portions of our Southern U.S. acreage and expect to announce additional agreements in the future.\nTurning briefly to forest carbon offsets, we're nearing completion of our pilot project in Maine and expect third-party approval soon. This project serves as a proof of concept for Weyerhaeuser and positions us well to advance additional forest carbon projects in 2023.\nWith these exciting developments, we continue to see multiyear growth potential from our Natural Climate Solutions business and maintain our target of reaching $100 million per year of EBITDA by the end of 2025.\nMoving to Wood Products on Pages 14 through 16. Wood Products contributed $147 million to fourth quarter earnings and $197 million to adjusted EBITDA. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was a 50% reduction from the third quarter, largely driven by continued softening in Wood Products markets and lower product pricing. For the full year, our Wood Products business generated over $2.7 billion of adjusted EBITDA, and our engineering Wood Products business established a new annual EBITDA record. Additionally, our distribution business generated the highest annual EBITDA in over 15 years. These are outstanding results, and I'm proud of our team's ability to deliver this level of performance, notwithstanding numerous challenges in 2022.\nTurning to some commentary on the Lumber and OSB markets. Benchmark prices for Lumber and OSB entered the fourth quarter, showing signs of stabilization after falling for much of the third quarter. As the quarter progressed, both markets exhibited cautious buyer sentiment resulting from a softening housing market in addition to broader concerns about the economy and inflation. Buyers maintained lean inventories and limited orders to necessity purchases through year-end. This drove benchmark prices lower for both lumber and OSB in the fourth quarter. As a result, -- the framing lumber composite pricing decreased by 24% compared to the third quarter and the OSB composite pricing decreased by 20%. That said, benchmark pricing for both projects -- products stabilized in January as buyers reentered the market to replenish lean inventories.\nAdjusted EBITDA for our Lumber business decreased by $80 million compared to the third quarter. Our average sales realizations decreased by 11% in the fourth quarter with relative outperformance compared to the benchmark, resulting primarily from our regional and product mix. Our sales and production volumes decreased significantly compared to the third quarter. These decreases resulted from a combination of the work stoppage-related impacts in the Northwest, adverse weather conditions in December and challenged reliability at several mills during the quarter. As a result, unit manufacturing costs increased significantly during the quarter. Log costs were modestly lower, primarily for Western logs.\nSpecific to our Northwest mills, which resumed operations in November following the work stoppage, much of the lumber we sold in the fourth quarter was manufactured using logs purchased in the third quarter when log prices were higher. As a result, margins compressed and are expected to remain lower until we work through the higher-cost log inventories and log prices in the Northwest adjust to reflect current lumber pricing levels.\nAdjusted EBITDA for our OSB business decreased by $47 million compared to the third quarter, primarily due to the decrease in commodity pricing. Our average sales realizations decreased by 16% in the fourth quarter. Production volumes were comparable. However, sales volumes decreased slightly, resulting from weather-related disruption challenge -- weather-related transportation challenges in Canada late in the quarter. Unit manufacturing costs decreased moderately and fiber costs were slightly lower in the quarter.\nEngineered Wood Products adjusted EBITDA decreased by $56 million compared to the third quarter. This result is directly tied to recent softening in demand for EWP products which are primarily used in single-family home building applications. Although we often see demand for engineered wood products slow somewhat during the winter months, the broader slowdown in the housing market in Q4 caused more of a pullback than ordinarily would be the case. As a result of this dynamic, our sales volumes decreased for all products compared to the third quarter. Production volumes were also lower as we elected to take temporary holiday downtime at several EWP facilities during the quarter.\nOur sales realizations decreased for all products, except for I-joists, which were comparable to the third quarter. Unit manufacturing costs were comparable in the fourth quarter, and raw material costs were moderately lower primarily for OSB web stock.\nIn Distribution, adjusted EBITDA decreased by $18 million compared to the third quarter largely driven by lower sales volumes, primarily for EWP products.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Davie to discuss some financial items and our first quarter and 2023 outlook.\n\nDavid M. Wold\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Weyerhaeuser Company\n\nThank you, Devin, and good morning, everyone. I will be covering key financial items and fourth quarter financial performance before moving into our first quarter and full year 2023 outlook. I'll begin with key financial items, which are summarized on Page 18.\nWe generated $167 million of cash from operations in the fourth quarter, bringing our total for the year to more than $2.8 billion, our second highest full year operating cash flow on record. As Devin mentioned, we are returning $1.75 billion to shareholders based on 2022 results, which includes $550 million of share repurchases.\nFourth quarter share repurchase activity totaled $146 million and we have approximately $375 million of remaining capacity under the $1 billion share repurchase program we announced in the third quarter of 2021. We will continue to leverage our flexible cash return framework and look to repurchase shares opportunistically when we believe it will create shareholder value.\nTurning to the balance sheet. We ended the year with approximately $1.6 billion of cash and cash equivalents, of which $662 million is earmarked for the supplemental dividend we announced yesterday that will be paid in February. Our balance sheet remains strong with ample liquidity, and we ended the year with approximately $5 billion of gross debt. Fourth quarter results for our unallocated items are summarized on Page 17.\nUnallocated adjusted EBITDA increased by $16 million compared to the third quarter. This increase was primarily attributable to changes in intersegment profit elimination and LIFO as well as benefits resulting from lower-than-expected health care expenses and increased discount rates on workers' compensation obligations.\nIn the fourth quarter, we completed the purchase of a group annuity contract, which was approximately $420 million of our Canadian pension liabilities to an insurance carrier. The contract purchase was funded from our Canadian pension plan assets with no company cash contribution required. As a result of the transaction, fourth quarter special items included a $205 million noncash pretax settlement charge. This transaction is the latest in a series we have executed to reduce our pension plan obligations. Since we began these efforts in 2018, our pension obligations have decreased from $6.8 billion to $2.3 billion as of year-end 2022.\nKey outlook items for the first quarter and full year 2023 are presented on Pages 23 and 24. In our Timberlands business, we expect first quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be slightly higher than the fourth quarter. Beginning with our Western Timberland operations, domestic log markets entered the first quarter showing continued signs of softening as a result of lower pricing and takeaway of finished products, along with elevated log inventories at mills. Regional log supply has improved compared to the fourth quarter and is expected to remain ample for the majority of the first quarter, notwithstanding winter weather disruptions. As a result, we expect our domestic log sales realizations to be significantly lower compared to the fourth quarter.\nOur fee harvest and domestic sales volumes are expected to be significantly higher in the first quarter as we have returned to full run rate operations following the work stoppage, which affected one month of operations in the fourth quarter. Per unit log and haul costs are expected to be moderately lower as we make the seasonal transition to lower elevation and lower-cost harvest operations. Forestry and road costs are expected to be significantly lower due to the seasonal nature of these activities.\nMoving to the export markets. Demand for our logs remained steady as customers in Japan and China work to build finished product inventories in preparation for seasonally stronger construction activity in the second quarter. We expect to significantly increase our export sales volumes to both markets compared to the fourth quarter, which was affected by one month of reduced export activity resulting from our work stoppage, but we also expect to shift additional volume to China to take advantage of higher-margin opportunities. That said, our export sales realizations are expected to be slightly lower in the first quarter as broader log markets continue to soften, resulting from the headwinds Devin previously mentioned.\nIn the South, we expect log demand to remain fairly steady in the first quarter, although grade and fiber markets are showing signs of slight softening as we enter 2023, particularly fiber markets in the East. As a result, we expect our sales realizations to be slightly lower compared to the fourth quarter. Fee harvest volumes are expected to be slightly lower due to seasonally wet weather in the first quarter. Per unit log and haul costs and forestry and road costs are expected to be comparable to the fourth quarter.\nIn the North, fee harvest volumes and sales realizations are expected to be slightly lower in the first quarter.\nTurning to our full year harvest plan. For 2023, we expect total company fee harvest volumes to increase to approximately 35 million tons. In the West, we anticipate our harvest volumes will be moderately higher than 2022 as we plan to capture the majority of the deferred harvest volumes resulting from our work stoppage. We expect our Southern harvest volumes to increase moderately compared to 2022 as we resume a more normalized level of activity following reduced harvest levels resulting from adverse weather conditions, primarily in the third quarter of 2022. We expect our Northern harvest volumes will be slightly higher year-over-year.\nTurning to our Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources segment. As Devin mentioned, HBU demand has moderated somewhat in response to broader macroeconomic concerns. That said, we are still seeing steady demand for our real estate properties, and we continue to expect a consistent flow of transactions with significant premiums to timber value.\nWe expect full year 2023 adjusted EBITDA of approximately $300 million for this segment. Consistent with previous years, we anticipate our real estate activity will be heavily weighted towards the first half of the year. Basis as a percentage of real estate sales is expected to be approximately 35% to 45% for the year.\nFirst quarter earnings before special items are expected to be approximately $10 million higher than the fourth quarter, while adjusted EBITDA is expected to be approximately $35 million higher, primarily due to the timing and mix of real estate sales.\nTurning to our Wood Products segment. As Devin mentioned, buyer sentiment remains cautious. That said, benchmark prices for Lumber and OSB have stabilized in January as buyers reentered the market to replenish lean inventories. Excluding the effect of changes in average sales realizations for Lumber and OSB, we expect first quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be moderately higher compared to the fourth quarter.\nFor Lumber, we expect higher production and sales volumes in the first quarter and significantly lower unit manufacturing costs as we resumed operations in our Northwest mills following the work stoppage in the fourth quarter. We also anticipate improved reliability across the system. Log costs are expected to be moderately lower primarily for Western logs.\nFor OSB, we expect sales and production volumes to be moderately higher in the first quarter due to less planned downtime for annual maintenance and improved transportation networks following extreme winter weather in December. We expect fiber costs and unit manufacturing costs to be lower compared to the fourth quarter.\nAs shown on Page 25, our current and quarter-to-date average sales realizations for Lumber and OSB are both moderately lower than the fourth quarter averages. For Engineered Wood Products, we expect significantly lower sales realizations in the first quarter resulting from softening demand for EWP products. Sales volumes are expected to be slightly lower for solid section products while I-joists sales volumes are expected to be moderately higher.\nWe anticipate significantly lower raw material costs, primarily for OSB web stock.\nFor our distribution business, we are expecting lower adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter due to lower margins for all products.\nI'll wrap up with some additional full year outlook items highlighted on Page 24. Our full year 2022 interest expense was $270 million. This represents a $43 million reduction from the prior year, largely due to the strategic refinancing transaction we completed in the first quarter of 2022. For full year 2023, we expect interest expense will be unchanged at approximately $270 million.\nTurning to taxes. Our full year 2022 effective tax rate was approximately 20%, excluding special items. For first quarter and full year 2023, we expect our effective tax rate will be between 12% and 14% before special items based on the forecasted mix of earnings between our REIT and taxable REIT subsidiary.\nFor cash taxes, we paid $566 million for full year 2022, which was slightly higher than our tax expense, excluding special items, due to the timing of Canadian tax payments. We expect our 2023 cash taxes will be comparable to our overall tax expense.\nFor pension and post-employment plans, the year-end 2022 funded status improved by approximately $100 million, primarily due to higher discount rates compared to year-end 2021. Excluding our fourth quarter settlement charge, our noncash, nonoperating pension and post-employment expense was approximately $50 million in 2022. We expect to record a similar total at approximately $50 million of expense in 2023. Cash paid for pension and post-employment plans in 2022 was $24 million. In 2023, we do not anticipate any cash contributions to our U.S. qualified pension plan and our required cash payments for all other plans will be approximately $25 million.\nTurning now to capital expenditures. Our full year 2022 capital spend totaled $462 million plus $6 million of capitalized interest. We expect total capital spend for 2023 will be approximately $440 million, which includes $110 million for Timberlands, inclusive of reforestation costs, $315 million for Wood Products and $15 million for planned corporate IT system investments.\nI'll now turn the call back to Devin and look forward to your questions.\n\nDevin W. Stockfish\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Weyerhaeuser Company\n\nThanks, Davie. As we begin to wrap up this morning, I'll make a few brief comments on the housing and repair and remodel markets.\nResidential construction activity has clearly softened from the peak levels of 2022, particularly in the single-family segment. As we enter 2023, our sentiment remains cautious for new and existing homes is being driven by numerous ongoing headwinds. Most notable is the affordability challenge brought about by increased mortgage rates, combined with significant increases in home prices over the last 2 years. In addition, we believe buyer psychology is being influenced by uncertainty related to the trajectory of mortgage rates, general concerns about the economy and falling home prices in many markets. As a result, we anticipate a more challenged housing market compared to the last couple of years, particularly in the first half of 2023. That being said, there are some signs recently that the environment may be improving.\nMortgage rates have ticked down from recent highs. Homebuilder sentiment improved in January and mortgage application activity has picked up over the last several weeks. Additionally, the labor market remains fairly strong overall and household balance sheets are generally in good shape. There are still plenty of people who want to home and can still get a mortgage, but many buyers are likely to remain on the sidelines until we see some improvements, but at the very least some stabilization in certain macroeconomic and housing-related trends.\nI will note, however, that despite what may be a period of choppiness in the near term, our longer-term view on the housing fundamentals continue to be very favorable, supported by strong demographic trends and a vastly underbuilt housing stock.\nTurning to repair and remodel. Activity in the repair and remodel market remained fairly stable in the fourth quarter and continue to be supported by steady demand from the professional segment. Demand from the do-it-yourself segment continued to soften from the elevated levels of the last couple of years and has returned to a more normalized pre-pandemic level. In the near term, we expect stable demand from the repair and remodel segment albeit perhaps at a slightly lower level than what we've seen over the last couple of years.\nLooking out beyond 2023, most of the key drivers supporting healthy repair and remodel demand remain intact and support our more bullish long-term outlook, including favorable home equity levels and an aging housing stock.\nNow before we move into questions, I'd like to provide an update on the progress we made in 2022 against the multiyear targets we set out during our Investor Day in September of 2021. As highlighted on Slide 20 -- Slide 22, we're progressing well on all fronts. Last year, we deployed approximately $300 million on Timberland acquisitions, including our Carolinas transaction. We grew our Natural Climate Solutions EBITDA by 13% compared to 2021 and announced our first 2 carbon capture and storage deals and we remain on track to grow this business to $100 million of EBITDA by year-end 2025.\nLast year, our teams captured approximately $40 million of margin improvements across our businesses and also made meaningful progress against our other OpEx priorities. I'm extremely pleased with this result, considering the inflationary pressures we experienced in 2022. We made progress against our 2030 greenhouse gas emissions reduction target. And finally, we demonstrated our ongoing commitment to disciplined capital allocation by increasing our quarterly dividend by 5.9% and returning $1.75 billion to shareholders based on 2022 results.\nSo in closing, our performance in 2022 reflected solid execution across all of our businesses. Entering 2023, our balance sheet is exceptionally strong. We have a competitive cost structure, and we are well positioned to navigate through a range of market conditions. We'll remain focused on servicing our customers and driving long-term value for shareholders through our unrivaled portfolio, industry-leading performance, strong ESG foundation and disciplined capital allocation.\nSo with that, I think we can open it up for questions."

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\nIt is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Andy Taylor, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. Mr. Taylor, you may begin.\n\nAndy Taylor\n\nThank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss Weyerhaeuser's second quarter 2022 earnings. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. Our earnings release and presentation materials can also be found on our website.\nPlease review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements as forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call.\nWe will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, and a reconciliation of GAAP can be found in the earnings materials on our website.\nOn the call this morning are Devin Stockfish, Chief Executive Officer; and David Wold, Chief Financial Officer.\nI will now turn the call over to Devin Stockfish.\n\nDevin W. Stockfish\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Weyerhaeuser Company\n\nThanks, Andy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, I'm very pleased to welcome David Wold to the call. David became our Chief Financial Officer in May. He previously served as our Chief Accounting Officer and brings 20 years of significant accounting, financial and strategic acumen to the CFO role. He's demonstrated outstanding leadership since joining Weyerhaeuser in 2013, and I'm excited to have Davie on our senior leadership team and to partner with him as we execute on our long-term strategy.\nThis morning, Weyerhaeuser reported second quarter GAAP earnings of $788 million or $1.06 per diluted share on net sales of $3 billion. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $1.2 billion in the second quarter. We delivered strong results across each of our businesses, and I'd like to thank our teams for their exceptional work and continued focus as we continue to navigate dynamic market conditions. Through their collective efforts, we've generated year-to-date adjusted EBITDA of $2.7 billion, our strongest first half EBITDA results on record.\nTurning now to our second quarter business results. I'll begin the discussion with Timberlands on Pages 6 through 9 of our earnings slides. Timberlands contributed $153 million to second quarter earnings. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $219 million, a decrease of $28 million from the prior quarter.\nIn the West, adjusted EBITDA decreased by $21 million compared to the first quarter. Western domestic log market softened slightly in the second quarter as mill inventories recovered at the outset of the quarter and lumber prices declined considerably from elevated levels earlier in the year. As a result, our second quarter domestic log sales realizations were moderately lower compared to the first quarter but remained high relative to historical pricing levels. While log supply in the Western system was ample at the outset of the quarter, it became constrained by unseasonably wet weather as the quarter progressed, which drove mill inventories to below target levels by quarter end, particularly in Oregon. These adverse weather conditions resulted in a moderate reduction in our fee harvest volumes compared to the first quarter. Forestry and road costs were seasonally higher, and per unit log and haul costs increased significantly in the second quarter as we transition into higher elevation logging units.\nTurning to our export markets. In Japan, demand for our logs remained strong in the second quarter. Lumber imports from Europe into Japan continue to be restricted by ongoing global shipping challenges for most of the quarter. This dynamic continued to drive increased market share for our customers and robust demand for our logs. As a result, our Japanese sales realizations were moderately higher compared to the first quarter. Our sales volumes increased significantly, resulting from strong demand and timing of ships.\nIn China, log inventories at the ports declined slightly in the second quarter, resulting from improved takeaway as pandemic-related lockdowns started to ease. Imports of lumber and logs into China continue to be limited by global logistical challenges and port congestion. Additionally, log supply into China continues to be impacted by restrictions on Australian logs, Russia's recent ban of log exports to China and disruptions of European wood flow resulting from the Russia-Ukraine conflict. As a result, demand for our Western logs remained favorable in the quarter, and our sales realizations for China export logs increased moderately. Our sales volumes to China, however, decreased significantly as we continue to intentionally shift volume to the domestic market to support our domestic customers and capitalize on favorable margin opportunities.\nMoving to the South. Southern Timberlands adjusted EBITDA decreased by $5 million compared to the first quarter. Notwithstanding weakening lumber and OSB pricing and a seasonal increase in log supply, Southern sawlog markets remained favorable during the second quarter as mills maintained elevated inventories to mitigate risks from ongoing transportation challenges. Fiber markets experienced a similar dynamic. As a result, our sales realizations increased slightly compared to the first quarter. Our fee harvest volumes were moderately higher as seasonal weather patterns transitioned to drier conditions. Forestry and road costs were seasonably higher and per unit log and haul costs increased significantly, primarily for fuel-related costs.\nTurning to our Southern export business. Our log exports to China remain temporarily paused due to the new phytosanitary regulations on pine logs put in place last year by Chinese regulators. We remain optimistic that this headwind for pine exports to China will be transitory and still maintain a constructive, longer-term outlook for our Southern export business to that market. In the meantime, we continue to redirect logs to domestic mills in the U.S. South and look to grow our India export market.\nIn the North, adjusted EBITDA decreased by $2 million compared to the first quarter due to significantly lower sales volumes associated with seasonal spring breakup conditions, partially offset by significantly higher sales realizations for most products.\nTurning to Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources on Pages 10 and 11. Real estate and ENR contributed $65 million to second quarter earnings and $107 million to adjusted EBITDA. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA was $9 million lower than the first quarter, primarily due to the timing and mix of properties sold, but was $16 million higher than the year ago quarter. Notwithstanding the recent macroeconomic headwinds, we continue to capitalize on favorable demand for HBU properties as buyers seek the safety of hard assets in an inflationary environment, resulting in high-value transactions with significant premiums to timber value.\nNow for a brief comment on Natural Climate Solutions. Following our announced agreement with Oxy Low Carbon Ventures in March for our first carbon capture and storage project in Louisiana, we continue to advance discussions with high-quality developers as this market continues to emerge. Additionally, we continue to make progress on our forest carbon pilot project in Maine and are working towards project approval by year-end.\nMoving to Wood Products on Pages 12 through 14. Wood Products contributed $863 million to second quarter earnings and $912 of adjusted EBITDA. Compared to the first quarter, adjusted EBITDA decreased by $321 million as lumber and OSB prices declined considerably from elevated levels earlier in the year. These are outstanding results considering the ongoing supply chain headwinds faced by our teams in the second quarter.\nStarting with the lumber and OSB markets. Benchmark lumber and OSB prices entered the second quarter on a downward trajectory as demand for homebuilding and repair and remodel soften and buyers reined lean inventories given uncertainty in the markets. Despite lean inventories throughout the channel, sentiment was cautious as buyers assessed downside risk of elevated price levels and were reluctant to build inventories in a dynamic pricing environment. By late April, benchmark pricing for both products stabilized as buyers took steps to replenish inventories to prepare for the spring building season and in response to strong April housing starts data.\nThis dynamic continued through mid-May, at which point, buyer sentiment once again turned cautious resulting from rapidly rising mortgage rates, housing affordability concerns and the prospects of a possible recession. This drove benchmark prices downward through late June before stabilizing at the end of the quarter as buyers reentered the market to bolster lean inventories. Despite the substantial reduction in lumber and OSB prices during the quarter, benchmark prices for both products remain elevated compared to pre-pandemic historical averages.\nAdjusted EBITDA for our lumber business decreased by $289 million compared to the first quarter. Our average sales realizations decreased by 25% in the second quarter, while the framing lumber composite pricing decreased by 32%. Our sales volumes increased significantly due to seasonal inventory drawdowns and improved production. Log costs increased slightly, primarily for Canadian and Southern logs, and unit manufacturing costs were slightly higher during the quarter.\nAdjusted EBITDA for our OSB business decreased by $60 million compared to the first quarter. Our average sales realizations decreased by 14% in the second quarter, while the OSB composite pricing decreased by 34%. This relative outperformance was largely a result of order files that lag rapidly declining OSB prices. Our sales volumes increased slightly, resulting from improved production. Unit manufacturing costs were moderately higher in the quarter and fiber costs were comparable.\nEngineered Wood Products adjusted EBITDA increased by $37 million compared to the first quarter and established a new quarterly EBITDA record. Sales realizations were significantly higher for most products, and we continue to benefit from previously announced price increases for solid section and I-joist products. This was partially offset by significantly higher raw material costs, primarily for OSB web stock. Production volumes were significantly higher for most products as veneer supply improved. As a result, sales volumes increased for most products in the second quarter.\nIn distribution, adjusted EBITDA decreased by $24 million compared to the first quarter, primarily due to lower margins resulting from the commodity price correction. The distribution team did a terrific job in managing inventories in this dynamic pricing environment.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Davie to discuss some financial items and our third quarter outlook.\n\nGeorge Leon Staphos\n\nMD and Co-Sector Head in Equity Research, BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division\n\nThank you, Devin, and good morning, everyone. It's a pleasure to be speaking with you all today and an honor to be serving as the CFO during such an exciting time in our company's history. I look forward to capitalizing on the opportunities in front of us and working with our incredible teams to continue driving growth for our businesses and superior long-term value for our shareholders.\nThis morning, I will be covering key financial items and second quarter financial performance before moving into our third quarter outlook. I'll begin with key financial items, which are summarized on Page 16.\nWe generated over $1.1 billion of cash from operations in the second quarter and more than $2.1 billion year-to-date. This represents our highest first half operating cash flow on record, surpassing the previous record established just last year. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.7 billion of cash and cash equivalents and total debt of just over $5 billion.\nCapital expenditures for the quarter were $81 million, which is a typical level for the second quarter. We returned $138 million to shareholders through share repurchase activity. These shares were repurchased at an average price of $36.23. And as of quarter end, we had approximately $670 million of remaining capacity under our $1 billion share repurchase program. We will continue to leverage our flexible cash return framework and look to repurchase shares opportunistically. We also returned $134 million to shareholders through the payment of our quarterly base dividend, which was increased in the first quarter by 5.9% to $0.18 per share.\nAdjusted funds available for distribution for the second quarter totaled $1.1 billion, as highlighted on Page 18, and we have generated over $1.9 billion of adjusted FAD year-to-date. As a reminder, we will supplement our base dividends each year with an additional return of cash to achieve the targeted annual payout of 75% to 80% of adjusted FAD. As demonstrated in 2021, we have the flexibility in our framework to return this additional cash in the form of a supplemental dividend or a combination of supplemental dividend and opportunistic share repurchase.\nSecond quarter results for our unallocated items are summarized on Page 15. Adjusted EBITDA for this segment increased by $66 million compared to the first quarter. This increase was primarily attributable to an $18 million noncash benefit for the elimination of intersegment profit in inventory and LIFO in the second quarter compared to a $59 million noncash charge in the prior quarter. The benefit was driven by a decrease in log and lumber inventories from elevated levels at the end of the first quarter.\nKey outlook items for the third quarter are presented on Page 19. In our Timberlands business, we expect third quarter earnings before special items, and adjusted EBITDA will be lower than the second quarter but moderately higher than the third quarter of 2021.\nTurning to our Western Timberlands operations. Domestic log demand was favorable at the outset of the third quarter, particularly in Oregon, as mills sought to bolster inventories prior to wildfire season. Log supply has improved following a period of unseasonably wet weather in the second quarter and is expected to remain elevated for the majority of the third quarter. As a result, we expect our domestic log sales realizations to be moderately lower in the third quarter, absent fire-related disruptions in the region. Forestry and road costs are expected to be seasonally higher and per unit log and haul costs are expected to be lower as fuel prices have decreased. We anticipate our fee harvest volumes will be comparable to the second quarter.\nMoving to the export markets. In Japan, demand for our logs is expected to soften in the third quarter due to a number of factors, including a recent increase of European lumber imports into Japan and a weakening Japanese housing market. As a result, our Japanese log sales realizations are expected to decrease moderately from the second quarter, and sales volumes are expected to decrease significantly.\nIn China, although log consumption has improved slightly as pandemic-related lockdowns have eased, log demand is expected to soften in the third quarter, resulting from elevated log inventories at the ports and a reduction in construction activity during the summer rainy season. As a result, our sales realizations on log imports into China are expected to be moderately lower compared to the second quarter. We anticipate our sales volumes will be lower as we continue to flex logs to our domestic customers to capture the highest margin.\nIn the South, log demand in the third quarter is expected to remain stable as the mills continue to mitigate risks from ongoing transportation challenges by maintaining elevated inventories. As a result, we expect our sales realizations to be comparable to the second quarter. We anticipate our fee harvest volumes will be moderately higher in the third quarter as weather conditions remain favorable. Forestry and road costs are expected to be seasonally higher, and we anticipate comparable per unit log and haul costs.\nIn the North, sales realizations are expected to be moderately lower due to mix. Fee harvest volumes are expected to be significantly higher compared to the second quarter as we have fully transitioned from spring breakup conditions.\nTurning to Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources. Consistent with prior years, we expect our real estate activity will be heavily weighted towards the first half of the year. We expect third quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be slightly lower than the third quarter of 2021 due to a decrease in acres sold year-over-year. As Devin mentioned, Real Estate markets have remained strong year-to-date, and we have capitalized on strong demand and pricing for HBU properties. As a result, we are revising our guidance for full year 2022 adjusted EBITDA to $325 million, an increase of $25 million from prior guidance. Additionally, we now expect basis as a percentage of real estate sales to be 30% to 40% for the year.\nFor our Wood Products segment, we expect third quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be comparable to the second quarter, excluding the effects of changes in average sales realizations for lumber and oriented strand board. Following a substantial reduction in pricing during the second quarter, benchmark prices for lumber and OSB entered the third quarter having stabilized as buyers reentered the market to bolster lean inventories. This dynamic continued throughout July, resulting in a steady increase in benchmark prices for both products.\nAs shown on Page 21, for both lumber and OSB, our current and quarter-to-date realizations are significantly lower than the second quarter averages. For our lumber business, we expect comparable sales volumes in the third quarter and moderately lower log costs. Unit manufacturing costs are expected to be comparable.\nFor our oriented strand board business, we expect slightly lower sales volumes and significantly higher unit manufacturing costs due to planned annual maintenance outages. Fiber costs are expected to be comparable.\nFor our Engineered Wood Products business, we expect significantly lower raw material costs, primarily for OSB web stock. We anticipate this will be partially offset by lower sales realizations, primarily for plywood products. Sales realizations for our solid section and I-joist products are expected to be comparable. Our sales volumes are expected to be comparable to the second quarter and unit manufacturing costs will be slightly higher as a result of planned annual maintenance outages in the third quarter.\nFor our distribution business, we are expecting adjusted EBITDA to be lower than the second quarter due to lower sales realizations for most products.\nI'll wrap up with a few additional comments on our total company financial items, all of which are summarized in our full year 2022 outlook update on Page 20.\nAs a result of the debt refinancing transactions executed in the first quarter, we now expect our full year interest expense to be $275 million, a $30 million decrease from prior guidance. Each year, in the second quarter, we finalize prior year-end estimates for pension assets and liabilities. As a result, we recorded a $67 million improvement in our net funded status as well as a reduction in our noncash, nonoperating pension and post-employment expense.\nFinally, we now anticipate our full year outlook for capital expenditures to be $460 million due primarily to the acceleration of equipment orders with extended lead times for future planned capital projects. There is no change to our previously announced multiyear guidance of $420 million to $440 million of annual capital expenditures for 2023 through 2025.\nWith that, I'll now turn the call back to Devin, and I look forward to your questions.\n\nDevin W. Stockfish\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Weyerhaeuser Company\n\nThanks, Davie. Before wrapping up this morning, I'll make a few comments on the housing and repair and remodel markets. Second quarter housing starts averaged 1.65 million units on a seasonally adjusted basis, a 4% reduction compared to the first quarter. While April housing starts reached the highest monthly level since 2006, activity softened as the quarter progressed. Housing permits in the second quarter averaged 1.73 million units, a 7% reduction compared to the quarter.\nAs we look out at the rest of the year, we do expect some softening in residential construction relative to earlier in the year, primarily as a result of the rapid increase in mortgage rates, ongoing housing affordability concerns, high inflation and concerns over a possible recession. We've already started seeing impacts from these headwinds with the reduction in new and existing home sales in recent months and through the most recent homebuilder sentiment data. However, as always, context is important.\nTo that end, I would note that we are still expecting housing starts and demand for wood products to be above pre-pandemic levels in 2022 despite these near-term challenges. Homebuilders have a significant backlog of houses to complete and we expect this backlog will support construction activity in the back half of 2022. And importantly, we remain constructive longer term on housing demand fundamentals given favorable demographic trends of significantly underbuilt housing stock, a healthy labor market and solid household balance sheets.\nTurning to repair and remodel where activity remained fairly stable quarter-over-quarter and continued to be supported by favorable demand from the professional segment. Demand from the do-it-yourself segment softened slightly in the second quarter as consumer sentiment turned cautious resulting from the recent macro uncertainties. That said, as the housing market enters a period of relative softening, this should result in more people remaining in their existing homes. And with healthy household balance sheets, favorable home equity and an aging housing stock, we continue to expect steady demand from the repair and remodel segment with activity above pre-pandemic levels.\nIn closing, our teams are delivering strong operational and financial results. Year-to-date, we've generated $2.7 billion of adjusted EBITDA and $1.9 billion of adjusted funds available for distribution. Looking forward, we remain constructive on long-term demand fundamentals that support our businesses, notwithstanding the recent macroeconomic headwinds. Our financial position is exceptionally strong and we remain committed to serving our customers and delivering industry-leading operating performance across our businesses. We are very well positioned to navigate these dynamic market conditions and to generate long-term value for our shareholders.\nAnd with that, I think we can open it up for questions."

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Danilo Juvane, Vice President of Investor Relations and ESG. Please go ahead.\n\nDanilo Marcelo Juvane\n\nVP of IR, The Williams Companies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Sarah, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us and for your interest in The Williams Companies. Yesterday afternoon, we released our earnings press release and the presentation that our President and CEO, Alan Armstrong; and our Chief Financial Officer, John Porter, will speak to this morning. Also joining us on the call today are Michael Dunn, our Chief Operating Officer; Lane Wilson, our General Counsel; and Chad Zamarin, our Senior Vice President of Corporate Strategic Development.\nIn our presentation materials, you'll find a disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to our remarks, and you should review it. Also included in our presentation materials are non-GAAP measures that we reconciled to generally accepted accounting principles, and these reconciliation schedules appear at the back of today's presentation materials.\nSo with that, I'll turn it over to Alan Armstrong.\n\nAlan S. Armstrong\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, The Williams Companies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Danilo. Our natural gas-focused strategy continues to deliver steady, predictable growth, and this past quarter was certainly no exception. In fact, we posted yet another quarter of record EBITDA, driven by growth across all 4 of our core business segments as well as our upstream JV operations.\nWe continue to set new records for contracted transmission capacity and expect this record-breaking performance to continue for many years to come as we execute on the 6 unique transmission expansion projects totaling 1.9 Bcf per day. And our G&P business remained strong with modest growth during the quarter, expected to ramp up over the balance of the year.\nWe continue to further advance our clean energy strategy through tightly aligned deals announced this quarter, including our acquisition of the Trace Midstream assets in the fast-growing Haynesville region, which just closed this past Friday and through our partnership with Context Labs that I'll detail more when we get to our key investor focus areas. Overall, we expect strong natural gas market fundamentals in steadfast project execution to drive additional growth for our business in '22. And as a result, we are raising financial guidance with expectations of another remarkable year of growth.\nImportantly, the midpoint of this new guidance is beyond the top of our previous range. So an impressive start to the year with a number of clear catalysts for growth for the balance of the year and into '23.\nAnd now I'll turn it over to John to go through the results for the quarter and our raised guidance. John?\n\nJohn D. Porter\n\nSenior VP & CFO, The Williams Companies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Alan. Starting here on Slide 1 with a summary of our year-over-year financial performance. Overall, '22 is off to a strong start. We've seen 7% growth in EBITDA or 13% if you adjust last year to remove the favorable effects of last year's severe winter weather, including Winter Storm Uri. And as we'll see on the next slide, our core natural gas-focused transmission and gathering and processing businesses have fueled this EBITDA growth, although we have also enjoyed continued strength in our upstream and marketing businesses.\nOur adjusted EPS increased 17%, continuing the strong trend of double-digit growth we've seen now for many years. Available funds from operations, AFFO, grew a bit more than EBITDA, continuing the trend of strong growth in this measure, up 16% year-over-year. As a reminder, AFFO is cash from operations, including JV cash flows, but excluding working capital fluctuations.\nIf you compare AFFO to our capital investments of $316 million and our dividends of $518 million, you see that we generated over $350 million in excess cash for the quarter. Also, you see our dividend coverage on this page based on AFFO continues to be very strong at 2.3x.\nOur debt to adjusted EBITDA metric continues to improve based on our strong growth in EBITDA and cash generation and our capital investment discipline. You see a nearly [0.4] or 9% improvement in this measure in only a year.\nSo now let's move to the next slide and dig a little deeper into our EBITDA results for the quarter. Again, another strong start this year with 7% growth, reflecting the combined effect of the performance of our core business and upside in our upstream operations. Walking now from last year's $1.415 billion to this year's $1.511 billion, we start by isolating those favorable effects from last year's severe winter weather, which were $77 million and are shown here in gray.\nMaybe just a quick opening comment regarding expense trends since inflation has been such a big topic lately. We've actually continued to see very solid cost control in our business. You may have noticed the $34 million increase in operating and maintenance expense on the face of our income statement, but this is really driven by a combination of higher reimbursable expenses that are offset in other fee revenue, new lease payments that were just a planned part of Transco's Leidy South expansion project; and finally, operating expenses associated with our new upstream operations.\nAnd related to the $31 million increase in SG&A on the face of the income statement, you should know that this is pretty much entirely related to the addition of the Sequent business. That also includes their bonus accrual and also an $8 million credit reserve related to a small customer bankruptcy.\nMoving next to our upstream operations on the waterfall chart here included in our Other segment. Upstream operations were up $56 million, excluding the $22 million of winter weather benefits from last year. Importantly, our first new Haynesville production only began in April, so really no contribution in this $54 million yet from Haynesville. So the full amount of the growth is attributable to our Wamsutter properties. And it's a bit of an apples-to-oranges comparison at that. As a reminder, last year, we owned 100% of the acreage we acquired from BP only for February and March, but in the first quarter of this year, we own 75% of the Wamsutter upstream JV, which now includes the combined BP, Southland and Crowheart acreage.\nShifting now to our core business performance. Our transmission and Gulf of Mexico business improved $37 million or 6%, primarily at Transco and largely from the Leidy South expansion project, which came online in phases last year. Overall, our average daily transmission volumes for Transco increased over 6% versus the prior year as we once again saw record winter natural gas demand. Now Transco's revenues are driven by reserve capacity, not actual throughput, but continued growth in actual throughput does highlight the criticality of Transco service.\nWe also saw higher margins in our Gulf of Mexico business. Our Northeast G&P business increased $16 million or 4%, driven by top line gathering and processing revenue growth on slightly lower volumes. G&P rate growth was supported by a combination of factors, including higher commodity-based rate, annual fee escalations and other expansion-related fee increases that more than offset lower cost of service rates at our Bradford franchise.\nThe slightly lower year-over-year Northeast volumes in the first quarter were anticipated in our initial guidance, and we expect a continued quarterly increase for the remainder of the year compared to the first quarter of '22 levels.\nWe continue to expect a gradual increase in overall Northeast volumes throughout the remainder of the year but ultimately, our plan for the Northeast in '22 continues to see higher EBITDA versus '21 on pretty flat volumes. However, we are well positioned to resume stronger volume and EBITDA growth in the Northeast in '23 driven by several expansion and optimization projects underway that Alan will discuss in more detail.\nShifting now to the West, which saw an impressive $35 million or 17% improvement over '21. In the West, we continue to see upside from our commodity price exposed rates in the Barnett, Piceance and Haynesville, as well as substantially higher volumes in the Haynesville that drove an 11% overall increase in volumes for the West.\nIn the West, we see a strong quarter-over-quarter growth trajectory throughout the rest of the year and especially in the second half of the year, driven primarily by strong drilling activity in the Haynesville.\nNext, you see a $30 million increase in our gas and NGL marketing services business, which includes both our legacy gas and NGL marketing business as well as Sequent. This improvement was primarily caused by the addition of Sequent in July of last year. Overall, this segment produced $65 million of EBITDA. As a reminder, the first quarter of each year is typically when Sequent creates the majority of its EBITDA, and this was a strong performance for the team.\nWhile we expect to see $50 million to $70 million of annual adjusted EBITDA contribution for this combined segment Sequent plus our legacy marketing business, this year, we've gotten off to a stronger start than expected. And with the strong commodity price expectation for '22, we expect to exceed this $50 million to $70 million range. So again, another strong start to the year with 7% growth in EBITDA of over $1.5 billion, driven by core business performance and upside in our upstream and marketing operations.\nLet's move to Slide 3 to look at our latest financial guidance thoughts for full year '22. We are pleased to share a substantial improvement in our '22 financial guidance versus what we provided in February of this year. I won't go through each of these metrics, but we'll offer some commentary on the most pivotal numbers.\nLet's start with adjusted EBITDA, where our midpoint is increasing $250 million, moving from $5.8 billion to $6.05 billion with a tightened range of plus or minus $150 million versus the original plus or minus $200 million. This substantial raise in EBITDA guidance is grounded in our confidence in the continued growth in our core business before considering the Trace acquisition.\nSpecifically, we expect steady quarterly EBITDA in our transmission and Gulf of Mexico business through the remainder of the year, but continued quarterly EBITDA and volume growth from our West and Northeast segments with some level of acceleration through the second half of the year. Additionally, for the remainder of '22, we expect a growing contribution from the Trace acquisition, which closed last week as it moves towards the targeted approximately 6x acquisition multiple based on its '23 EBITDA.\nAnd finally, with respect to our Upstream operations, we are encouraged by the results we've seen thus far in '22 and remain confident in the fourth quarter exit rates we quoted at our Analyst Day.\nShifting down the page now to growth CapEx, you'll note a $1 billion increase in guidance from a combination of the $950 million Trace acquisition value and other Trace-related CapEx. Note that we've closed the Trace acquisition using a combination of cash on hand and other sources of liquidity, including our revolver and commercial paper.\nYou see that our debt to adjusted EBITDA remained steady at 3.8x reflecting the balancing of our increased EBITDA with our increased growth CapEx for Trace. The remainder of the guidance items either changed in relation to the change in EBITDA that I've just discussed or remain unchanged as in the case of maintenance CapEx.\nSo again, a substantial increase in EBITDA guidance of $250 million at the midpoint, driven by continued growth in our core business as well as contributions from Trace acquisition and sustained expectations for our upstream JV operations.\nSo with that, I'll pass it back to Alan to review our key investor focus areas. Alan?\n\nAlan S. Armstrong\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, The Williams Companies, Inc.\n\nOkay. Well, thanks, John. I'm going to move on now to the key investor focus areas here on Slide 4. Our natural gas focused strategy continues to play out with strong fundamentals that are driving incremental growth opportunities, particularly as we continue to see increasing demand for U.S. LNG exports along the Transco corridor, as well, we have seen domestic demand for power and industrial sectors continue to grow despite much higher natural gas prices. Admittedly, it has been somewhat surprising to us how inelastic this demand has remained.\nThe challenge ahead to meet this stubborn and growing demand isn't higher cost of supply, it is simply that we need more U.S. infrastructure to connect some of the world's lowest cost supplies to this burgeoning demand. I'll current point out that Transco delivered a record-breaking 17.15 million dekatherms on January 3. And while extreme winter weather usually coincides with these peak day deliveries, this volume record was due to growing demand in the Transco markets. And we expect this natural growth in demand to continue as we continue to see loads within our existing footprint.\nOur G&P business continues to thrive in the current environment, allowing us to capture the upside benefit of pricing and inflation adjusters in our rates that have been sitting on their floors for many years. And we continue to execute our upstream JV strategy by realizing the near-term benefits of its commodity price exposure while setting the stage for continued use of our latent midstream capacity in the longer term as these volumes grow.\nAnd now I'm going to move on to our financial strength and stability. And as detailed earlier by John, we increased our guidance midpoint to $6.05 billion, driven by the following. First of all, strong base business performance with volumes in the Northeast G&P business expected to rebound for the balance of the year and of course, this, along with the higher rates that we're seeing in some of our consolidated assets has got a set up for a very strong performance for the balance of the year.\nStrong performance of our gas and NGL marketing business in first quarter and the growing volumes in our upstream JV, which are enjoying higher than planned pricing is another driver. And finally, incremental volume and earnings from the Trace acquisition, as we've mentioned earlier. With our recent updated guidance, we expect to achieve a 4-year EBITDA CAGR now of 7% and an impressive EPS CAGR of 19% at our midpoint.\nOn the whole, our business continues to fire on all cylinders, driving our financial strength and stability. And the picture actually just keeps improving as we have been well positioned to capture the upside in this environment.\nLooking now at our exposure to growth. Given the current strength of natural gas fundamentals in the U.S. and abroad, we see a significant runway of growth opportunities for Williams. First of all, we now have 1.9 Bcf per day of high-return Transco projects that have now moved into execution. This has been raised since our Analyst Day due to recently secured customer commitments to advance the Texas-Louisiana energy pathway project, which moved out of the development bucket into execution, and this project connects low-cost South Texas gas supplies with LNG markets in Louisiana.\nSecond, in the Gulf of Mexico, we secured another customer agreement at Salamanca, further building on growth momentum in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, which continued to deliver more and more opportunities in response to these higher oil prices.\nIn the Northeast, we've reached agreements with our producing customers for significant gathering expansions in both the rich Utica and the rich Marcellus. And we now have 4 significant expansion projects under execution that will drive growth showing up later this year and into 2023.\nAnd our strategic bolt-on acquisition of assets from Trace Midstream closed last week. And this now positions Williams as the second largest gas gatherer in the fast-growing Haynesville. This is consistent with our long-held strategy to seek a #1 or #2 position in the key basins in which we operate.\nWith our Haynesville gas gathering capacity now above 4 Bcf per day, we continue to crisply execute on our wellhead-to-water strategy. In fact, we are close to commercializing the Louisiana Energy Gateway project. And given significant interest by various shippers, we do expect to announce the final investment decision on that project soon.\nOur growth prospects don't stop with these projects. However, we see more opportunities on the horizon, even as we navigate an evolving regulatory environment.\nImportantly, we saw the FERC responded concerns from both industry and legislators in a constructive manner this past quarter, and we are optimistic that regulators recognize the need for reliable permitting process to support natural gas infrastructure.\nImportantly, key legislative leaders have renewed their focus on streamlining permitting in our country to ensure we've got the necessary midstream infrastructure to support our country's LNG build-out goals.\nAnd finally, let's look at the development that's related to our new energy ventures. Obviously, as we think about decarbonization, there are a lot of opportunities to invest in energy innovation and new technologies. As part of our strategy to accelerate the next-generation energy marketplace, Williams has established a corporate venture capital fund that is set up in a way to support direct investments in start-ups that leverage Williams' assets for decarbonization solutions as well as limited partnership funds that specifically invest in low-carbon technologies.\nA great example of how we're utilizing this VC fund is our recently announced partnership with Context Labs on a technology solution to support the gathering, marketing and transportation of responsibly sourced natural gas from wellhead to end user. And by leveraging the Context Labs' technology, we will enable supply and delivery decisions that connect the cleanest energy sources to meet real-time energy needs across the country.\nAlso supporting our work in this space, we just announced a collaboration with Cheniere Energy to implement a QMRV pilot that will further the development of advanced monitoring technologies to enhance clean energy supply and delivery for Williams and its customers. So lots of exciting things happening in this space and all positioned around supporting and enhancing our natural gas focused strategy.\nSo in closing, I'll reiterate that our intense focus on our natural gas focused strategy has built a business that is steady and predictable with continued growth, improving returns and free cash. Our best-in-class long-haul pipes are in the right place serving the very best markets. And by design, our formidable gathering the assets are in the low-cost basins that will be called on to meet gas demand as it continues to grow.\nThese gathering assets are irreplaceable and critical infrastructure within the natural gas value chain. And our Sequent platform that extends across the natural gas pipeline and storage industry is providing infrastructure optimization services that create value for Williams and our customers while mitigating downside risk.\nYou've heard me say it before, but we remain bullish on natural gas because we recognize the critical role it plays and will continue to play in both our countries and the world's pursuit of a clean energy future.\nNatural gas is an important component of today's fuel mix and should be prioritized as one of the most important tools to aggressively displace more carbon-intensive fuels around the world. Our networks are critical to serving both domestic and global energy demand in a lower carbon and economically viable manner.\nAnd finally, as we look overseas to the energy crisis in Europe and its ripple effects on energy security, the importance of affordable and reliable energy supplies on a global scale has now taken center stage.\nWilliams is excited about the important role we will play in meeting the dual challenge of delivering increasing amounts of reliable, affordable energy while also continuing to decrease greenhouse gas emissions around the world. Utilizing our critical infrastructure that is connected to the best natural gas basins in the U.S. to increasingly serve LNG export facilities and growing U.S. demand for clean affordable energy is a great place for our organization to start.\nAnd with that, I'll open it up for your questions.\n\nDanilo Marcelo Juvane\n\nVP of IR, The Williams Companies, Inc.\n\nOperator, please open up the Q&A line."

Just a reminder, today's call is being recorded. And now at this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Danilo Juvane, Vice President of Investor Relations, ESG and Investment Analysis. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nDanilo Marcelo Juvane\n\nAnalyst, BMO Capital Markets Equity Research\n\nThanks, Bo, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us and for your interest in the Williams Companies. Yesterday afternoon, we released our earnings press release and the presentation that the President and CEO, Alan Armstrong; and our Chief Financial Officer, John Porter, will speak to this morning. Also joining us on the call today are Micheal Dunn, our Chief Operating Officer; Lane Wilson, our General Counsel; and Chad Zamarin, our Executive Vice President of Corporate Strategic Development. In our presentation materials, you'll find a disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to our remarks, and you should review it. Also included in the presentation materials are non-GAAP measures that we reconciled to generally accepted accounting principles. And these reconciliation schedules appear at the back of today's presentation materials. So with that, I'll turn it over to Alan Armstrong.\n\nAlan S. Armstrong\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Inside Director, The Williams Cos., Inc.\n\nOkay. Well, thanks, Danilo, and thank you all for joining us today. Another positive story to share with you this quarter, and you can see some of those highlighted here and called out on Slide 2. First of all, adjusted EBITDA up 8%, adjusted earnings per share up 5%, and our gathering volumes were up 6%. And -- and certainly, while this growth and beat is impressive, our resiliency in the face of low commodity prices is even more impressive and gave us another opportunity to distinguish ourselves from the pack, which is largely posted declines this quarter. And our growth continues to compound despite these price swings in natural gas. This quarter was a perfect example where we saw an 8% EBITDA increase on the back of a very strong 14% increase for the same period last year.\nJohn will dive deeper into the numbers in a moment, but let me start out with a few highlights from the quarter.\nOur financial performance is our track record, but it is the day-to-day focus on execution by our teams that drives these results and really does set us apart. As an example, our teams have done a fantastic job of quickly integrating the Mountain West acquisition into our core business. And in fact, we're pleased to announce that we've already secured binding precedent agreements to support a significant expansion on the newly acquired Overthrust pipeline. This project was not even in our upside case for this investment and the team has identified even more growth to come that is beyond our original expectations. Much of this growth is centered around coal to natural gas conversions in the Western states.\nOn Transco, we continue to advance our emission reduction program and recently completing completed our first large-scale compressor replacement project in Virginia. Our backlog of high-return pipeline expansion opportunities continue to progress, Driven by a large wave of incremental demand that continues to exceed our expectations. As evidence of this continued wave of increasing demand, we recently concluded a nonbinding open season to advance another large-scale Transco project that will provide much needed capacity to serve our customers south of Station 165 in Virginia.\nOur customers' recent -- customers requested capacity that has been well in excess of the 800,000 dekatherms per day that we offered. Importantly, the minimum required term for this service offering was 20 years. This underscores our belief in the durable and fast-growing demand for capacity and the market's confidence in our ability to deliver this capacity with the lowest environmental impact following the approval of the Mountain Valley Pipeline. We're now working to find a way to serve as much of our customers' needs as possible and hope to have an update on this exciting project soon.\nMoving on to financial performance. As I stated earlier, despite a weakened natural gas price environment, our financial results not only grew against the difficult comp in a difficult environment, but this quarter marked the 30th consecutive earnings sprint that either met or exceeded consensus estimates. Within our legacy base business in the Northeast, we produced record EBITDA and record gathering volumes delivering growth that far outpaced the total production across the Marcellus. Our strategy to focus on connecting our producing customers to the best markets with the most reliable service available, has grown this business to the point it is nearing $2 billion per year of EBITDA.\nThe completion of the Mountain Valley Pipeline, our Regional Energy Access project and continued growth of gas-fired generation in the local market will continue to provide market and volume growth well into the future. In the West, we also achieved record gathering volumes once again showing that our diverse geographic position is built to weather commodity price swings. In our transmission and Gulf of Mexico segment, we are enjoying the beginnings of a long runway of growth in the deepwater, gearing up for a long string of expansions on Transco and enjoying better-than-expected growth in our Mountain West acquisition, which speaks to our successful integration. Importantly, the strength of our base business more than offset weaker E&P earnings and expected low seasonal cash flows from our marketing business. The quarter's results continue to prove out the inherent stability and stubborn growth of our business.\nHowever, when we see the market fail to appreciate our ability to deliver in most price environments, we will continue to execute on our authorized repurchase program growth well into the future. In the West, we also achieved record gathering volumes once again showing that our diverse geographic position is built to weather commodity price swings.

The quarter's results continue to prove out the inherent stability and stubborn growth of our business. However, when we see the market fail to appreciate our ability to deliver in low price environments, -- we will continue to execute on our authorized repurchase program, much like we did during the second quarter. And finally, a few notes on our sustainability efforts. Last week, we issued our 2022 sustainability report and completed our annual CDP climate questionnaire. These are both important markers that detail our progress on key issues like environmental stewardship, community support and workforce development.\nTo us, sustainability means running our business in a way that will create value for the perpetual shareholder. So we're proud to have also be providing our shareholders with industry-leading returns on invested capital, and we expect our shareholders to further benefit from enhanced capital returns as we execute on our large -- however, backlog, which, among others, includes 7 out of 9 major pipeline projects that are coming online in the fourth quarter of -- and that will be stacked on top of a solid foundation of a sustainable base business. And with that, I'm going to turn things over to John to walk us through the financial metrics of the quarter. John?\n\nJohn D. Porter\n\nVice President-Investor Relations, Financial Planning and Analysis, The Williams Cos., Inc.\n\nThanks, Alan. Starting here on Slide 3 with a summary of our year-over-year financial performance. Beginning with adjusted, we saw another strong quarterly increase of 8% and over the prior year, and this happens to coincide with an 8.6% CAGR over the last 5 years for the same measure. And this strong performance included a new record for gathering volumes, which increased 6%. Year-to-date, our adjusted EBITDA is now up 13% driven by the growth of our core infrastructure businesses which continued to perform very well even as natural gas price decreased 61% for the first half of 2023 versus the first half of 2022, once again demonstrating the resiliency and strength of our natural gas focused strategy, our assets and our operational capabilities.\nFor second quarter, our adjusted EPS increased 5% for the quarter, continuing the strong growth we've had in EPS over the last many years with our year-to-date EPS now up 23%. Available funds from operations. AFFO growth for second quarter was in line with adjusted EBITDA. And you see our second quarter dividend coverage based on AFFO was a very strong 2.23x, growing about 2% despite growing our dividend by 5.3%. Our balance sheet continues to strengthen with debt to adjusted EBITDA now reaching 3.5x versus last year's 3.82x, and that's even after closing the Trace, Nortech and Mountain West acquisition and also repurchasing $139 million worth of shares since last year.\nBy CapEx, you see an increase primarily reflecting the progress we're making on some of our key growth projects, including Regional Energy Access and Louisiana Energy Gateway. For the full year, there is no change to our consolidated adjusted EBITDA guidance of $6.4 billion to $6.8 billion or any of our other guidance metrics. But in a moment, I'll provide a little color on our expectations for the remainder of the year versus the performance we've seen thus far in 2023.\nSo let's turn to the next slide and take a little closer look at the second quarter results. A strong 8% increase in EBITDA over prior year even as average natural gas prices for the second quarter decreased 71%. Walking now from last year's roughly $1.5 billion to this year's $1.6 billion, we start with our upstream joint venture operations that are included in our Other segment, which were down $43 million versus last year. Our Haynesville upstream EBITDA was down about $14 million despite substantially higher production due to much lower net realized prices and a lower working interest percentage on new wells beginning in January of 2023.\nOur upstream EBITDA was down $29 million due primarily to lower realized prices, but production also continued to be impacted throughout April from the historically difficult Wyoming winter weather we saw in the first quarter. Shifting now to our core business performance. Our transmission and Gulf of Mexico business improved $96 million or 15%, including about a $52 million contribution from our Mountain West Pipeline and Nortech acquisition but with other increases in our transmission and deep water revenues as well.\nOur Northeast G&P business performed extremely well with the $65 million or 14% increase driven by an $81 million increase in service revenues. And we did have a onetime $14 million favorable gathering revenue catch-up adjustment in that second quarter increase in service revenue. But this revenue increase was really fueled by a 6% increase in total volumes in the Northeast.\nShifting now to the West, which increased to $16 million or 5%, benefiting from continued strong volume growth in the Haynesville and positive hedge results that partially offset the impact of lower commodity base rate. And then you see the $22 million decrease in our gas and NGL marketing business, and the majority of this decline was actually related to lower NGL marketing results from inventory valuation changes where we had a gain on NGL inventories last year but a loss this year.\nSo again, the second quarter continued our strong start to 2023 with 8% growth in EBITDA, driven by core infrastructure business performance in spite of natural gas prices that were 71% lower than second quarter of 2022.\nSo let's turn the page and touch on the year-to-date comparison. Year-to-date, we've seen a 13% increase over '22 Walking now from last year's $3 billion to this year's $3.4 billion, we start with the upstream joint venture operations included in our Other segment, which were down $39 million versus last year. Our year-to-date, Hayneville is up nicely on very strong volume growth that has been significantly offset by lower realized prices. However, the overall Haynesville increase was offset by lower 1 set of results due primarily to the historically difficult winter weather we saw in Wyoming this year.\nShifting now to our core business performance. Transmission and Gulf of Mexico business improved $127 million or 9% on really similar themes as our second quarter, namely the impact of the Mountain West Pipeline and Nortech acquisition. However, we have seen other significant increases in our transmission and deepwater revenues as well.\nOur Northeast G&P business has performed very well with $117 million or 13% increase driven by $154 million increase in service revenue. This revenue increase was fueled by a 7% increase in total volumes focused in our liquids-rich areas where we tend to have higher per unit margins than our dry gas areas. And in the appendix, you'll find a slide that compares our 7% volume growth to the overall basin growth of just under 2%.\nShifting now to the West, which increased $42 million or 8%, benefiting from positive hedge results and the Trace acquisition, but the West was significantly unfavorably impacted by the severe Wyoming weather and January processing economics at our Opal Wyoming processing plant. And then you see the $144 million increase in our gas and NGL marketing business caused by the strong first quarter that we had at the start of the year. So again, a continuation to the strong start to 2023 with 13% growth in EBITDA driven by core infrastructure business performance with strength from our marketing business that dramatically overcame weaker-than-expected results from the upstream joint ventures.\nSo as I mentioned earlier, there's no change to our consolidated adjusted EBITDA guidance of $6.4 billion to $6.8 billion or any of our other guidance metrics. We've definitely had a strong start to the year with $3.4 billion of EBITDA through the first half of the year. And thanks to the performance of our base business, we have clear visibility to hitting at least the midpoint of our guidance even after a historic decline in natural gas prices and a historically difficult winter that continue to have impacts through April.\nSo you may be wondering why we aren't raising our guidance on the back of such a strong start to the year and a bright future ahead. First, I will remind you that our guidance does include a range of $200 million above our midpoint. And second, while we usually experience stronger third and fourth quarters than second quarter, the third quarter does occasionally see hurricane outages for our deepwater business. Finally, we could also still see downward shifts in natural gas prices for the balance of the year that could unfavorably impact our upstream joint ventures in particular.\nWhile we are not suggesting there is a high likelihood of realizing these impacts, we do need to be prepared to overcome these scenarios. Therefore, it is too early to raise our full year guidance. But once again, we are confident in the continued performance of our base infrastructure businesses allowing us to once again meet or exceed the midpoint of our guidance range. We're setting our sights on continued growth in '24 before another big growth step in 25. And with that, I'll turn it back to Alan.\n\nAlan S. Armstrong\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Inside Director, The Williams Cos., Inc.\n\nOkay. Thanks, John. Just a few closing remarks before we open it up for your questions here. First, I'll start by reiterating our belief that Williams remains a compelling investment opportunity. We are the most natural gas-centric large-scale midstream company around today and the integrated nature of our business from our best-in-class long-haul pipes to our formidable gathering assets, which are complemented by our Sequent platform that delivers upside to our base business is unique, and we have a track record to prove it.\nSecond, our combination of proven resilience 5-year EPS CAGR of 23%, industry-leading coverage on our steadily growing dividend, a strong balance sheet and high visibility to growth, we think is unique among amongst the S&P 500 and unique within our sector. Let me emphasize that our natural gas-focused strategy has allowed us to produce a 10-year track record of growing adjusted EBITDA through a number of commodity and economic cycles, and it is continuing to deliver significant growth in the current environment. And we're now celebrating 7.5 years of delivering in line or better quarterly results. That is especially impressive when you consider the sector's ups and downs over this period and the fundamentals are setting up stronger than ever for this long-term predictable growth to continue.\nAnd finally, as we think about our long-term strategy, we see that U.S. natural gas infrastructure is key to meeting both today's energy demand as well as projected growth of electrification and renewables build out in the future. Simply put, you cannot implement and accelerate when solar and large-scale electrification without having natural gas as a reliable, complementary partner to these big system changes. In fact, despite continued growth in solar and wind capacity, the country saw record natural gas power demand in July, reaching as high as 53 Bcf per day last week to meet summer power loads.\nThis tops the previous record set last July by 6%, again, compounding growth on top of compounding growth. And so if we truly do want to meet our country's growing power demand for things like data centers and EVs and accelerate wind and solar power generation, we must continue increasing natural gas infrastructure. capacity. This fact has become evident to both the majority of our legislators and the Biden administration as they came out with unprecedented support for Mountain Valley Pipeline's completion.\nWilliams is here for the long haul, and we are committed to leveraging our large-scale natural gas infrastructure network for the benefit of generations to come. And with that, I'll open it up for your questions."

Welcome to The Williams First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I'd now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today, Danilo Juvane, Vice President of Investor Relations, ESG and Investment Analysis. Please go ahead.\n\nDanilo Marcelo Juvane\n\nAnalyst, BMO Capital Markets Equity Research\n\nThanks, Andrea, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us and for your interest in The Williams Companies. Yesterday afternoon, we released our earnings and press release and the presentation that our President and CEO, Alan Armstrong; and our Chief Financial Officer, John Porter, who will speak to this morning. Also joining us on the call are Micheal Dunn, our Chief Operating Officer; Lane Wilson, our General Counsel; and Chad Zamarin, our Executive Vice President of Corporate Strategic Development.\nIn our presentation materials, you'll find a disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to our remarks, and you should review it. Also included in the presentation materials are non-GAAP measures that we reconcile with generally accepted accounting principles. And these reconciliation schedules appear at the back of the day's presentation material. And with that, I'll turn it over to Alan Armstrong.\n\nAlan S. Armstrong\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Inside Director, The Williams Cos., Inc.\n\nOkay. Well, thanks, Danilo, and thank you all for joining us today. Well, another first quarter and another strong start for Williams. So let me begin here on Slide 2 by calling out a few operational financial and strategic achievements we saw this first quarter. Starting here on the left of this slide, Yet again, we've set a record for contracted transmission capacity led by Transco, the largest and fastest-growing natural gas pipeline. And in January, we closed on our acquisition of a portfolio of Natural Gas Storage assets from an affiliate of [indiscernible] partners for approximately $1.9 billion. The transaction included 6 underground natural gas storage facilities located in Louisiana and Mississippi, making us the largest owner of storage on the Gulf Coast.\nDemand for natural gas has greatly outpaced natural gas storage capacity since 2010. And our thesis of this underinvestment is now being realized as this newly acquired storage is being re-contracted at rates above our acquisition expectations. In fact, storage rates have reached the point of supporting Brownfield expansions, and we are gauging interest from customers willing to underwrite potential expansion of these facilities in the form of long-term contracts. Also in the first quarter, we announced the expansion of the Southeast Supply Enhancement project to roughly 1.6 Bcf a day of capacity, and we prefiled this project with the FERC on February 1. We expect to make the official FERC filing later this year. And I'll remind you that this project will serve both the Mid-Atlantic and the Southeast markets. These markets are experiencing increasing gas demand from power generation and the reshoring of industrial loads.\nSince the time of our open season, the large utilities that we serve in this area have come back and provided dramatic increases to their generation needs based on data centers to be built in the region, as well as reshoring of industrial markets. So we believe that we are in the early innings for expansions in these Mid-Atlantic and Southeast markets. Our project execution teams also delivered an impressive list of accomplishments this quarter. In total, we have 20 high-return projects in execution across our business, including approximately 3.1 Bcf per day of expansion on Transco, which equates to a 15% increase in fully contracted long-term capacity that will be coming online over the next few years. Within these Transco opportunities, a few noteworthy accomplishments to hit.\nFirst, we placed the Carolina Market Link in service and now began receiving the full revenues in this quarter. Next, we commenced construction for the Southside Reliability Enhancement and the Southeast Energy Connector projects, and we received the FERC order for the Alabama-Georgia Connector and the Texas to Louisiana Energy Pathway projects. And finally, we're advancing a number of modest but high-return expansion projects on our MountainWest Transmission System. This is a period where we have a tremendous amount of large projects and sometimes it's easy to overlook things as large as even the well deepwater project but happy to report to you that great execution by our teams there in some pretty difficult environments has that project coming in quite a bit below our original capital estimate on that project, and we do expect now this project to start up towards the end of this year. So congratulations to our deepwater team that have been working on that project for about 4 years now, and pretty remarkable accomplishments to get that project in on budget and actually below budget.\nAnd then finally, our teams are well on their way to replacing 112 mainline compressor units with state-of-the-art low-emission turbines and electric drive units on Transco and Northwest Pipe. As a reminder, these projects will generate an incremental regulated return realized through a rate case or a traction mechanism that will begin in 2025. So again, a huge body of work there to go in and replace this compression that is well past its useful life, but the team is doing a great job. You can imagine the efforts that go into replacing that scale of operations. But we have so much going on. It's kind of easy to miss. So and we're excited to see the earnings from that show up in '25. So now turning to the highlights of our first quarter financial performance.\nWe delivered quarterly EBITDA of $1.934 billion, which was 8% higher than last year, an impressive feat given the tough comp we were up against and the 25% year-over-year decline in natural gas prices and the lack of severe winter weather in most of our markets. An important takeaway from the quarter is that our outperformance occurred despite year-over-year lower earnings in the marketing and upstream segments, which reaffirms the strength and resilience of our underlying business, no matter the commodity price environment. To this end, we expect to deliver our EBITDA in the top half of our earlier guidance. And to be clear, we think we can accomplish this with continued soft gas prices and without any further earnings contributions from our Marketing segment. Due to the ongoing steady growth and resilience of our business, we recently raised the 2024 dividend by 6.1% underscoring our confidence in our ability to continue this strong record of per share growth through even extreme low commodity price environments and with the slate of high-return growth projects under execution right now and in development.\nWilliams remains well positioned to grow at this rate for many years to come. And with that, I'll turn it over to John to walk through the quarter and year-to-date financials. John?\n\nJohn D. Porter\n\nVice President-Investor Relations, Financial Planning and Analysis, The Williams Cos., Inc.\n\nAll right. Thanks, Alan. Starting here on Slide 3 with a summary of our year-over-year financial performance. Beginning with adjusted EBITDA, we saw an 8% year-over-year increase despite natural gas prices that averaged less than $2 for the first quarter of 2024. Now included in that 8% overall growth is almost 13% growth from our primarily fee-based infrastructure businesses, excluding marketing and the upstream JV. As we'll see on the next slide, our adjusted EBITDA growth was driven by strong growth from our core large-scale Natural Gas Transmission, Gathering and Processing and Storage businesses, including the expected favorable effects of our recent acquisitions. And it also included strong performance from our Sequent Marketing business, which had another strong start to the year despite falling a bit short of the extraordinary start they had to 2023.\nOur adjusted EPS increased 5% for the quarter, continuing to grow off of the 19% ,5-year CAGR we've had for EPS for 2018 through 2023. And available funds from operations growth was just over 4%. Also, you see our dividend coverage based on AFFO was a very strong 2.6x on a dividend that grew 6.1% over the prior year. And our debt to adjusted EBITDA was 3.79x in line with our expectations for slightly higher leverage in 2024 before dropping back down in 2025 to guidance of 3.6x. So before we move to the next slide and dig a little deeper into our adjusted EBITDA growth for the quarter. We'll provide a few updates to our financial guidance. Overall, based on our strong start to 2024, we are now guiding to the upper half of our 2024 adjusted EBITDA range of $6.95 billion to $7.1 billion and we are also well positioned for upside to drive towards the high end of this original guidance. We also remain well positioned to deliver on our 2025 adjusted EBITDA range of $7.2 billion to $7.6 billion.\nAdditionally, based on our improved adjusted EBITDA outlook and other changes, including interest expense and income assumption shifts, we now see our key per share metrics, adjusted EPS and AFFO per share coming in at the high end of their ranges for 2024, which in the case of AFFO per share would lead to a higher overall dividend coverage ratio as well. Now specifically for 2024, our transmission in Gulf of Mexico business is tracking a bit ahead of plan with a good first quarter and expectations of continued best-in-class execution on our many key high-returning organic projects, as well as immediate results from our Gulf Coast storage acquisition with strong performance expected going forward. Our Northeast Gathering and Processing business was basically right on plan for first quarter with drilling in the higher-margin wet gas areas and inflation adjusters offsetting lower volumes in some dry gas areas.\nThe West got off to a strong start in the first quarter, where DJ performance following our recent transactions along with all the hard work our teams did in preparing for winter allowed for excellent execution, especially across our Rocky's assets. We see the West also tracking a bit ahead of plan, although we're also embedding a bit more conservatism around Haynesville volume assumptions. For both the Northeast and West G&P assets, our guidance update today provides room for additional volume reductions and for upside movement toward the higher end of the range if those don't occur. For the Marketing business, we've had a strong overall start to 2024. But again, beating the midpoint of our full year 2024 guidance doesn't rely on any additional help from Sequent at this point.\nAnd then finally, nice to see our upstream joint ventures off to a strong start versus our plan, again, supported by the preparation our team made for winter weather. So we expect our upstream joint ventures to perform well against their plan this year as well. So let's turn to the next slide and take a little closer look at the first quarter results. Again, it was a strong start to the year with 8% growth over the prior year. Walking now from last year's $1.795 billion to this year's record $1.934 billion, we start with our Transmission in Gulf of Mexico business, which improved $111 million or 15% due to the combined effects of nearly a full quarter contribution from the Hartree Gulf Coast Storage acquisition, which is delivering as expected, following a flawless integration effort thus far. Higher Transco revenues, including partial and service from the Regional Energy Access project, and also a full quarter contribution from the MountainWest Pipeline acquisition, which closed mid-February in 2023.\nThe Segment growth was unfavorably impacted by last year's Bayou Ethane divestiture and also some planned maintenance at Discovery. Our Northeast G&P business performed well with the $34 million or 7% increase driven by a $22 million increase in service revenues. This revenue increase was fueled by rate escalations that occurred after the first quarter of last year. [indiscernible] Gathering volumes were roughly in line with our plan, down about 2% versus the prior year, with those decreases focused in the dry gas areas. Shifting now to the West, which increased $42 million or 15%, benefiting from a great start for the DJ transactions we completed in the fourth quarter of 2023. Now the increase in the DJ Basin results was about the same magnitude as the unfavorable loss of hedge gains that we had in the first quarter of 2023. Additionally, last year, the West was significantly unfavorably impacted by the severe Wyoming weather and January processing economics at our Opal Wyoming processing plant.\nAs I mentioned a moment ago, much work was done by our teams to prepare for winter weather this year, and those preparations proved effective in getting us off to a great start for the West and also for our upstream operations in Wyoming. Overall, West gathering volumes performed roughly in line with our plan, up 5% on the benefits of our DJ transaction and better Wyoming volumes, which more than offset declines primarily in the Haynesville area. And then you see the $41 million or 18% decrease in our Gas and NGL marketing business. As I mentioned a moment ago, it was another strong start to the year, but it did come up a bit short of the extraordinary 2023 start. Our upstream joint venture operations included in our Other segment were down about $9 million or 15% from last year. Our Wamsutter upstream EBITDA was actually up about $8 million with strong volume growth that was substantially offset by lower net realized prices. However, the Wamsutter increase was more than offset by lower Haynesville results from both lower net production volumes and net realized prices. So again, a strong start to 2024 with 8% growth in EBITDA, driven by core infrastructure business performance with continued strength from our marketing business.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it back to Alan.\n\nAlan S. Armstrong\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Inside Director, The Williams Cos., Inc.\n\nOkay. Thanks, John. And so just a few closing remarks before we turn it over to your questions. First of all, natural gas demand is not just growing now, it is accelerating. This period of low natural gas prices is reaffirming the great bargain that natural gas offers as a practical low-cost, clean energy solution and the power hungry world we live in is rapid turning to natural gas to generate this power. This compounded with the hard to miss growth in LNG exports and data centers as well as the continued drumbeat of electrify everything and resort it is accelerating demand and the expansions of our uniquely placed infrastructure will demand a premium. We have been betting on and setting our strategy around the benefits of natural gas for many years and have focused our investments in this space.\nSo if you want to invest in natural gas infrastructure, no one is more concentrated than Williams. We are the most natural gas-centric large-scale midstream company around today, and our natural gas-focused strategy will be relevant for decades to come, thanks to the accelerating natural gas demand we are seeing today. Our strong conviction of the strategy led us to the bolt-on acquisitions of strategic assets like MountainWest Pipeline, Hartree Storage and NorTex Storage. A couple of points on these acquisitions. First, these deals were quickly -- sorry, these deals were directly in line with our strategy based on where we thought the puck was going. The synergies and commercial opportunities we expected are already being realized, thanks to clear plans and decisive actions. And finally, I'll reiterate our belief that Williams remains a compelling investment opportunity.\nOur conservative but distinct strategy continues to deliver steady, predictable growth and value to our shareholders and checks all the boxes that a long-term investor looks for in a durable and winning portfolio. We've now seen 11 consecutive years of adjusted EBITDA growth and an 8% CAGR of adjusted EBITDA since 2018 and I'll remind you that, that is without issuing equity to drive this growth. In addition, we have recognized a 19.5% return on our invested capital during the same period, and our steadfast project execution has led to record contracted transmission capacity and will continue to drive growth in 2024 and beyond. On the predictability front, we have met or beat analyst estimates for 33 quarters in a row now and beat the estimate 2/3 of the time over this 8-year period. And this year marks the 50th year in a row that The Williams Companies has paid a dividend.\nIn closing, we've built a business that is delivering record profitability and strong financial returns in the present, but is positioned even better for the future. And with that, I'll open it up for your questions."

Welcome to The Williams Second Quarter Earnings 2024 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today, Danilo Juvane, Vice President of Investor Relations, ESG and Investment Analysis. Please go ahead.\n\nDanilo Marcelo Juvane\n\nAnalyst, BMO Capital Markets Equity Research\n\nThanks, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us and for your interest in The Williams Companies. Yesterday afternoon, we released our earnings press release and the presentation that our President and CEO, Alan Armstrong; and our Chief Financial Officer, John Porter, will speak to this morning. Also joining us on the call today are Micheal Dunn, our Chief Operating Officer; Lane Wilson, our General Counsel; and Chad Zamarin, our Executive Vice President of Corporate Strategic Development.\nIn our presentation materials, you'll find a disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important integral to our remarks, and you should review it. Also included in the presentation materials are non-GAAP measures that we reconcile to generally accepted accounting principles. And these reconciliation schedules appear at the back of today's presentation materials.\nSo with that, I'll turn it over to Alan Armstrong.\n\nAlan S. Armstrong\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Inside Director, The Williams Cos., Inc.\n\nGreat. Well, thanks, Danilo, and thanks for joining us today. The story that John and I get to lay out for you this morning is one of consecutive growth as Williams continues to deliver on a long-term trend of per share growth and resilience regardless of the macro environment. In fact, we delivered record second quarter results, driven by the strong performance of our Transmission and Storage business this quarter, even our Gathering and Processing business held up very well despite challenging natural gas prices. The good news is that a meaningful increase in natural gas demand that continues to exceed our expectations will take advantage of these abundant supplies driving growth for years to come, and the supply side is poised to respond with over 1 Bcf a day of volumes from delayed TILs and temporary shut-ins to return to our gathering systems.\nAnd before we get deeper into the financial metrics, I want to hit on a few key themes from the quarter, namely our crisp execution of key projects that are positioning us for continued earnings growth and the ongoing focus we are optimizing our portfolio and ensuring sustainable operations.\nSo starting here on Slide 2. Our teams have executed on an extraordinary amount of strategic priorities, including placing projects into service in the Northeast, West and the Deepwater, Gulf of Mexico. Just to run down the list quickly here. Last week, we placed Transco regional energy access into full service ahead of schedule and under budget once again, ensuring clean and reliable natural gas is available to serve the Northeast region for the upcoming winter heating season. And while the DC Circuit Court did issue a decision last week to vacate the FERC certificate for ARIA, we believe the court's concerns about the FERC process is once again flawed and will be fairly easy for the FERC to resolve.\nIn the meantime, we are taking the necessary legal and regulatory steps to address the court's concerns, and ensure that this much-needed firm transportation capacity continues to be available to serve the needs of our customers without interruptions. I'll remind you that our industry has seen court rulings in the past with projects such as Sabal Trail as well as fires expansion. With both of these projects operating today, we see limited risk on a eruption REA operations and are prepared to help the FERC in reaffirming the merits of this important project.\nOther notable expansions, we've recently completed include the Marcellus gathering expansion that serves Southwestern rich gas zone in the Marcellus and the fully contracted Basin transmission expansion. In the Deepwater, there are 2 new fields that will increase EBITDA in the third quarter on our Discovery system, which we now fully own. So we're excited about the acquisition of the additional interest in Discovery, and we're really excited about the kind of growth that we're seeing both here in the near term and the long term. So first of all, Chevron's large anchor development and Beacon's Winterfell 5-well program are both fully connected and will drive a large increase in EBITDA for 2025 as well as for the balance of this year.\nAdditionally, brought on their prospect on June 25 that will grow EBITDA on our Eastern Gulf assets. We were also active on advancing construction for several key projects. We initiated construction activities on the Louisiana Energy Gateway gathering, treating and carbon capture project as well as Transco's Texas to Louisiana Energy Pathway project, which we call TLEP. TLEP project provides our anchor shipper EOG resources with access to the LNG corridor in higher-priced markets on the Transco Pipeline and specifically all the way into the Louisiana market. So we're excited about getting started on that fairly significant project for us.\nAnd then recently, we also signed a precedent agreement on Transco's Gilles West expansion. This will bring new, reliable and low-cost supplies to CenterPoint Energy Houston area markets from Louisiana, so this is effectively a backhaul on Transco, helping CenterPoint to reduce their dependence on the Texas intrastate gas pipeline systems. Importantly, this quick turn project will add meaningful EBITDA with very little capital required on our part to place it into service.\nI also want to call out the significant emissions reductions and cost savings accomplished in the quarter as part of our system-wide emission and emission reduction program. Thus far, we have replaced 57 transmission compressor units and are on track to meet our goal of 112 units to be replaced by the end of this year, so that we can begin recovering on these investments in our listed rates. And on that note, we will file our new rates on Transco at the end of this month and the new rates will go into effect in March of '25. So incredible amount of work going on by teams to replace a lot of these very old units with modern low-emission equipment on the system. And a lot of times, those kind of projects kind of get overlooked, but tremendous amount of effort and great execution going on by the teams on that front as well.\nLooking at the second column, we continue to take steps to optimize our asset portfolio. We sold our stake in the Aux Sable joint Venture and an attractive gain and consolidate our ownership interest in the Gulf of Mexico Discovery system and an attractive value given both the very near and long-term growth on this asset.\nFrom a financial perspective, we remain on track to achieve the top half of '24 EBITDA guidance and we also reaffirm our expectations for 2025, which translates into a 5-year EBITDA CAGR of 8%. More importantly, the growth in our per share metrics will be just as strong over this 5-year period with AFFO per share CAGR of 7% and our EPS CAGR of 12% over this 5-year period.\nOf note, the fundamentals to sustain and even improve on this industry-leading earnings and cash flow growth beyond '25 actually continue to improve. Our Southeast -- our project is just of a few projects we expect from the secular end of increased demand for power generation, and we remain in the best position to secure additional infrastructure solutions in and around our Transco pipeline footprint. And finally, we continue to prioritize being a responsible operator in all that we do. And this is clearly outlined in our 2023 sustainability report that we published last week. This report is really a deep dive on how we focus on doing business the right way, and one area I'll call is our efforts in progressing on our decarbonization goals. We are focused on proving up that the natural gas industry can play an even more important role in providing affordable and reliable energy while also continuing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions here at home and around the world.\nAnd so with that, I'll turn it over to John to walk through the second quarter financials. John?\n\nJohn D. Porter\n\nVice President-Investor Relations, Financial Planning and Analysis, The Williams Cos., Inc.\n\nThanks, Alan. Starting here on Slide 3 with a summary of our year-over-year financial performance, beginning with adjusted EBITDA, we saw about a 3.5% year-over-year increase, despite low natural gas prices that fell about 5% versus 2Q '23, averaging close to -- for second quarter of 2024. And that 3.5% adjusted EBITDA growth is over a second quarter last year that had grown about 8%. So in spite of low natural gas prices, once again, our resilient business continued to grow even [indiscernible] customers employed pretty significant temporary production reduction measures like not completing drilled wells and/or not turning in-line wells that now stand ready to flow as prices improve.\nAs we'll see on the next slide, our adjusted EBITDA growth was driven by strong growth from our large-scale natural gas transmission and storage businesses, including the favorable effects of our recent acquisitions. Year-to-date, our adjusted EBITDA is now up 6%, so inline in the middle of our long-term growth target of 5% to 7%. For Q2, our adjusted EPS was up 2% and year-to-date EPS is up about 3%. So a bit slower EPS growth in '24 as compared to the 19% 5-year CAGR that we've seen through 2023. But as Alan mentioned, looking through '25, we do see a 5-year CAGR that will be in excess of 12%. For 2Q, available funds from operations, AFFO growth was 3% and 4% year-to-date. Similar story here with this slower '24 growth is following an 8% 5-year CAGR through 2023. And when you look through 2025, we see a 5-year CAGR of 7%.\nAlso, you see our 2Q dividend coverage based on AFFO was a very strong 2.16 on a dividend that grew 6.1% over the prior year and 2.38x coverage year-to-date. And our debt to adjusted EBITDA was [ 3.76x, ] which is in line with our expectations, slightly higher leverage in 2024 before dropping back down in 2025 to guidance of 3.6x or better.\nSo before we move to the next slide and dig a little deeper into our adjusted EBITDA growth for the quarter, we'll provide an update to our financial guidance. In general, our second quarter update is unchanged from what we provided in our first quarter earnings presentation. Based on our strong start to '24, we guided to the upper half of our 2024 adjusted EBITDA range of $6.95 billion to $7.1 billion, and we indicated that we were well positioned for upside to drive toward the high end of this original guidance.\nWe also shared that we remain well positioned to deliver on our 2025 adjusted EBITDA range of $7.2 billion to $7.6 billion. And that based on our improved '24 adjusted EBITDA outlook and some other changes, we saw our key per share metrics, adjusted EPS and AFFO per share coming in at the high end of their ranges for 2024. So again, no major shift to that first quarter update, except perhaps to say that we are increasingly comfortable that we can clear the $7 billion level for 2024 adjusted EBITDA while still not counting on any additional help from Sequent. And of course, we also wouldn't include the around $150 million gain we expect to have on Aux Sable sale in there as well as we exclude gains and losses on asset sales from our adjusted EBITDA measure.\nSo let's turn to the next slide and take a little closer look at our first quarter results. Walking now from last year's $1.611 billion to this year's $1.667 billion. We start with our transmission and Gulf of Mexico business, which improved $64 million or just over 8.5% due to the combined effects of a full quarter contribution from the Hartree Golf storage acquisition, which is delivering as expected, following a flawless integration effort. We also had higher Transco revenues, including partial in-service from the Regional Energy Access project, and segment growth was unfavorably impacted by last year's Bayou ethane divestiture and also some planned downtime in the Eastern North of Mexico.\nNow the $36 million unfavorable variance for the Northeast G&P business is really against a strong quarter last year that included the effect of a onetime $15 million favorable gathering revenue catch-up adjustment. However, we did see lower Northeast gathering volumes that were driven by those temporary producer reductions that were basically roughly in line with our plan for the year. And partially, those volume reductions were partially offset by rate escalations across several franchises in the Northeast.\nShifting now to the West, which increased about $7 million, benefiting from the DJ transactions that we completed in the fourth quarter of 2023. The increase in the DJ Basin results was about the same magnitude as the unfavorable loss of hedge gains we had in 2023. Segment performance was also favorably impacted by higher NGL service results, including Highland Overland Pass pipeline volumes where low natural gas prices have supported greater ethane recoveries. Overall, West gathering volumes were also lower as a result of temporary producer reductions primarily in the dry gas Haynesville area.\nAnd then you see the $2 million lower marketing loss that was in line with our plan based on the expectation that our natural gas marketing will typically have a loss in the second quarter. Our upstream joint venture operations included in our other segments were up about [ $2 million ] from last year. So again, a second quarter that continued to beat our business plan, proving once again our ability to grow our business in spite of a challenging natural gas pricing environment and also giving us further confidence in our ability to beat $7 billion of adjusted EBITDA in 2024.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it back to Alan.\n\nAlan S. Armstrong\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Inside Director, The Williams Cos., Inc.\n\nOkay. Well, thanks, John. Just a few closing remarks before turning it over to your questions. I'll end where I started with my remarks, and that is to emphasize what Williams has been able to deliver in the current environment and how well positioned we are for the future as natural gas demand continues to grow. As we think about our long-term strategy, we are confident in the role our valuable natural gas infrastructure will play in meeting both today's energy demand as well as the projected growth from power generation and LNG exports. We are seeing demand grow at an unprecedented pace and expansions of our uniquely placed infrastructure will demand a premium.\nSimply put, there is no other midstream company today that is set up better than Williams to capture this demand growth. We are the most natural gas-centric large-scale midstream company around today, and our natural gas-focused strategy continues to deliver growth on top of growth quarter after quarter. And to that point, we've now seen 11 consecutive years of adjusted EBITDA growth and an 8% compound annual growth rate of our adjusted EBITDA since 2018. In addition, we have realized a 19.5% return on our invested capital during the last 4 years, and our steadfast project execution led to record contracted transmission capacity and will continue to drive per share growth in 2024 and beyond. In fact, our current projects in execution have higher returns than this prior 4 years.\nSo in closing, we've built a business that is delivering record profitability and strong financial returns in the present, but is positioned for even faster -- for an even faster-growing future.\nAnd so with that, we'll open it up to your questions. Thank you."

Today's conference is being recorded.\nAt this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Danilo Juvane, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nDanilo Marcelo Juvane\n\nVP of IR, The Williams Companies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Gina, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us and for your interest in The Williams Company.\nYesterday afternoon, we released our earnings press release and the presentation that are President and CEO, Alan Armstrong; and our Chief Financial Officer, John Porter, will speak to you this morning. Also joining us on the call today are Micheal Dunn, our Chief Operating Officer; Lane Wilson, our General Counsel; and Chad Zamarin, our Senior Vice President of Corporate Strategic Development.\nIn our presentation materials, you'll find a disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to our remarks, and you should review it. Also included in our presentation materials are non-GAAP measures that we reconcile to generally accepted accounting principles, and these reconciliation schedules appear at the back of today's presentation materials.\nSo with that, I'll turn it over to Alan Armstrong.\n\nAlan S. Armstrong\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, The Williams Companies, Inc.\n\nGreat. Thanks, Danilo, and thank you all for joining us today. Williams reported another great quarter, and John will walk through the details in a moment, but the punchline is that Williams delivered exceptional results in the third quarter with adjusted EBITDA up 15% compared to the same period last year, driven by strong performance across all of our core businesses and our JV upstream operations.\nOur natural gas strategy has proven that it can capture upside margins and weather commodity price cycles as we work to serve growing demand for clean, secure and affordable energy. These results really speak to the strength of our assets and our long-term approaches business. Williams is the most natural gas-centric large-scale midstream company around today, and there's a reason we've stuck with our natural gas-focused strategy for as long as we have. Not only is this strategy delivering in the current environment, but the signals coming from the market show that it is going to continue to deliver substantial growth for the long term as well.\nWe expect strong fundamentals to drive attractive growth opportunities for Williams, including higher demand for U.S. LNG exports and a faster pace of coal to gas conversion with the lion's share of these projects residing along the Transco corridor. Natural gas demand across various sectors continues to increase in the face of higher natural gas prices. This speaks to the continued inelastic demand for natural gas, both here and abroad and the fact that domestic natural gas remains a bargain versus alternative fuels.\nWe continue to see strong growth in the quarterly natural gas -- in our quarterly natural gas gathering volumes and our contracted transmission capacity. And we're seeing progress on important projects like our Regional Energy Access project, the Louisiana Energy Gateway and other Transco projects that are currently in execution. And speaking of execution, our attractive high-return growth backlog in the Gulf of Mexico remains intact. With the 6 previously announced Deepwater projects set to increase EBITDA by over $300 million beginning in '25. And we recently began pipelay operations on the well projects here just recently.\nOur business continues to fire on all cylinders, driving our financial strength and stability. And despite the current inflationary environment, we will actually see a lift in margins as many of our contracts allow for adjustments that exceed the impact of expenses. For instance, in our G&P business, our contracts are built with inflation escalators that bolster our margins in the current environment. And within our transmission business, we are able to recover cost via rate cases, which minimizes the impacts of inflation over time.\nI'll note that Northwest Pipeline recently reached a settlement on its rate case, and we remain on track to follow a Transco rate case in '24. The benefits of our long-term approach to business also extends to the current interest rate environment and in fact, all of our debt is fixed rate. John is going to provide some more detail on this in his section but we are extremely well positioned in this current environment. Also worth noting, our business is well positioned for a recessionary environment. Recall that in 2020, Williams has faced a host of challenges, including rapidly declining commodity prices, major producer customer bankruptcies and impactful hurricanes in our Gulf of Mexico business. In the face of these challenges, the company still exceeded the (inaudible) of the guidance we set well before COVID raise its ugly head.\nOur business today remains positioned to thrive even in the face of potential recession. In fact, we announced that we expect to be near the high end of our previously raised guidance putting us on track to achieve 4-year earnings per share CAGR of 22% and an EBITDA CAGR of 8%. This, again, underscores just how well our natural gas strategy is translating into solid financial results for our shareholders. And while we will not be providing our '23 guidance until the next quarterly call, there are some drivers that you should think about for '23.\nSo let me go through those here. First of all, in the Northeast G&P business, we expect higher volume growth and higher cash flows from expansion projects that are currently underway, and many of those are nearing completion. And we do provide some details of those in the appendix. In the West G&P segment, we expect continued contributions from the large number of Haynesville expansion projects that are nearing completion and as well the Trace Midstream acquisition. But equally important are the expected contributions from our upstream JVs, which should provide incremental volume growth in both the Haynesville and in the Wamsutter area, proving that our strategy to fill up weight and midstream capacity is working. We expect modest growth in other basins as well, for instance, in the Eagle Ford, which has been under the radar recently.\nWe also see a very bright spot here next year as we expect increased activity in the rich gas part of the basin to drive volumes well above the minimum volume commitment level for this segment of the business, which will be the welcome rebound and extend our earnings above that MVC level. The Eagle Ford should represent upside longer term as well as new capital will likely be deployed to further develop both the acreage that is already dedicated and some undedicated acreage that we are well positioned to serve.\nIn the transmission and Gulf of Mexico business, the growth drivers here include the incremental earnings from our recent production that has been connected along our existing Deepwater assets. So this is new production that's been recently connected and it'll start to show up here in the fourth quarter, it does not include those projects that will start coming on towards the end of 2024.\nThe NorTex acquisition is also will be included in our transmission and Gulf of Mexico business, and the continued expansion of our fee-based services on our interstate gas pipeline systems that continue to grow. Within our upstream JVs, volume growth will remain the story in the Haynesville, we've stated that we expect an ownership reversion in the first half of '23, where Williams will own 25% of the PUDs, but we will retain a 75% interest in the PDPs.\nI want to be clear about this. Our interest in the existing flowing production does not get reduced, only our interest in the undeveloped acreage will be reduced. We designed this structure to minimize significant volatility in earnings. And to this end, we expect the Haynesville to remain a source of growth. In the Wamsutter where we have a much larger acreage footprint, our JV is just now beginning to complete wells from the 2022 drilling program, and these will begin to contribute this volume growth next year. And this, we believe, is going to prove up the benefits of the contiguous acreage in this basin, and we're excited about the Crowheart operations out there and what we're seeing from those recent drilling and completion operations.\nOur primary goal of getting the volumes and cash flows up on these late and midstream assets will be more than met. But the icing on the cake has been the higher-than-expected pricing for these producing reserves. Over the longer term, we see a steady increase in net cash flows as the drilling capital obligations revert more and more to the JV operator and the benefits of the growing volumes build our midstream cash flows. Ultimately, we expect to find a long-term owner for these upstream properties that we can rely on to further grow production, which will translate into even higher midstream cash -- free cash flows for Williams.\nLooking beyond 2023, we believe that our projects are supportive of a 5% to 7% long-term EBITDA CAGR. The annual growth rate may fluctuate a bit given the timing of new large projects like Regional Energy Access and our big Deepwater projects coming on at the end of '24 and into '25, but the bottom line is that we see a clear trajectory to continued earnings growth based on the opportunity set of our footprint today. Finally, as we think about value chain integration, we are further advancing our integrated clean energy value chain strategy. Our acquisition of the NorTex storage facility and last week's approval from the FERC for Transco's Washington storage facility in Louisiana enables us to offer competitive market-based rates to LNG, power generation and other customers in the Gulf Coast area.\nThis will be a critical element of our Wellhead to Water Strategy as this combined a 110 Bcf of working gas storage and our expansive Transco network are fortified with low emissions Haynesville production from the LEG project. We are also making strides in advancing our wellhead to end-user strategy with our agreement with PennEnergy Resources to support the marketing and delivery of certified low emissions, gas that we refer to as next gen natural gas.\nThis agreement includes an independent third-party certification process that verifies best practices are being followed to minimize emissions and produce natural gas in the most environmentally responsible manner. This is another exciting step to grow the delivery of next gen gas to markets across the U.S. as well as overseas. So with that, I'll pause and turn it over to John to walk through the quarter and our year-to-date results, and then we'll open it up for your questions. John?\n\nJohn D. Porter\n\nSenior VP & CFO, The Williams Companies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Alan. Starting here on Slide 2 with a summary of our year-over-year financial performance. Overall, 2022 financial performance continues to be quite strong. Beginning with adjusted EBITDA, we saw a 15% year-over-year increase for the third quarter and a 12% increase for the first 9 months of '22 versus '21. As we'll see on the next couple of slides, our adjusted EBITDA growth has been led by our core large-scale natural gas transmission and gathering and processing businesses, complemented nicely by growth in our upstream joint ventures. Our adjusted EPS increased just over 37% for the quarter and 34% year-to-date. Available funds from operations, AFFO, which is basically our cash flow from operations less working capital fluctuation, the noncontrolling interest cash flows grew in line or better than adjusted EBITDA at 15% year-over-year for the quarter or 18% for the 9-month period.\nAlso, you see our dividend coverage on this page based on AFFO was 2.4x for third quarter and 2.29x year-to-date. Our debt to adjusted EBITDA metric continues to improve based on our strong growth in adjusted EBITDA and our capital investment discipline, now reaching 3.68x versus last year's 4.04x. So now let's move to the next slide and dig a little deeper into our adjusted EBITDA results for the quarter. Again, the third quarter built nicely on the strong start we've seen this year with 15% growth reflecting the combined effect of the performance of our core business and upside from our upstream joint ventures.\nWalking now from last year's $1.420 billion to this year's $1.637 billion, we start with our upstream joint venture operations that are included in our Other segment, which were up $60 million. Since our first new production in the Haynesville came online in April of this year, we've seen a rapid ramp in volumes that will continue through the remainder of the year.\nAs Alan mentioned, the strategic purpose of our upstream joint ventures is to fuel growth in our core related gathering assets, and that's certainly what we see happening in 2022. Shifting now to our core business performance. Our transmission and Gulf of Mexico business improved $41 million or 6% due to improved contributions from both Transco and our Gulf of Mexico businesses. Transco saw higher revenues, largely from the Leidy South expansion project, which came online in phases last year. Gulf of Mexico was significantly higher in '22, due in part to the lack of hurricane-related impacts that occurred in 2021.\nOperating and maintenance costs were higher, driven in part by higher maintenance activities but we are tracking very close to plan through the first 9 months of the year. Our Northeast G&P business increased $22 million or 5%, driven by top line gathering and processing revenue growth on slightly lower volumes. Gathering and processing rate growth was supported by a combination of factors, including higher commodity-based rates, annual fee escalations and other expansion-related fee increases that more than offset the lower cost of service rates at our Bradford franchise.\nOverall, Northeast volumes were 10.8 Bcf per day and roughly in line with our current forecast for total 3Q volumes. We continue to expect an increase from this volume level for the fourth quarter. But as we've mentioned in past calls, our '22 plan for the Northeast has always been higher EBITDA versus 2021 on pretty flat volume growth.\nHowever, as Alan mentioned, we remain well positioned to resume stronger volume and EBITDA growth in the Northeast in 2023, driven by several expansion and optimization projects. Shifting now to the West, which saw another impressive quarter of year-over-year growth, up $80 million or 31% over 2021. I should mention that $27 million of the $80 million was attributed to our Trace Midstream acquisition, which closed on April 29 of this year.\nSo even without Trace, the West still increased $53 million or 21%. In the West, we continue to see upside from our commodity price exposed rates, especially in the Barnett and Haynesville as well as substantially higher volumes in the Haynesville that drove a 12% overall increase in volumes for the West and that's excluding the Trace acquisition. Next, we saw a $4 million or 12% increase for our gas and NGL Marketing Services business. This increase was despite taking a $54 million lower of cost or market adjustment to our gas and NGL inventories in September of this year.\nGenerally speaking, most of this adjustment, which was associated with our gas and storage will result in higher margins when those products are sold out of inventory late this year or early next year. So again, another strong quarter with 15% growth in EBITDA driven by core business performance and upside in our upstream joint venture operations.\nLet's move to Slide 4 and look at the year-to-date comparison. Through the first 9 months of '22, we've now generated 12% growth in adjusted EBITDA over 2021, 3 strong consecutive quarters for this year. So stepping now from last year's $4.152 billion to this year's $4.644 billion, starting with the $77 million of first quarter of 2021 Winter Storm Benefits that we're showing here in gray. And then moving to the $182 million contribution from our midstream operations which were Wamsutter related in the first quarter of '22, and then begin to have a more significant Haynesville component in the second and third quarters. Our transmission in Gulf of Mexico business has seen 4% growth year-to-date, driven by Transco's Leidy South expansion project and strong first quarter '22 seasonal revenues and also higher Gulf of Mexico results due to less hurricane-related impacts in '22 versus '21, partially offset by higher operating and maintenance costs.\nThe Northeast G&P business has now seen 6% growth year-to-date, driven by higher rates on overall flat volumes, as previously discussed. The West has seen an impressive 27% growth year-to-date, driven by higher commodity base rates, but also a strong 11% overall volume growth, excluding the Trace acquisition. Finally, our gas and NGL Marketing Services segment is up $32 million, driven by favorable commodity margins as well as the new contributions from the Sequent acquisition that closed on July 1, 2021, and the year-to-date comparison was also unfavorably impacted by lower cost or market adjustments on inventories as discussed in the third quarter comparison, which as we discussed, should result in higher margins in the future.\nSo an impressive $491 million or 12% increase to land us with over $4.6 billion of adjusted EBITDA through the first 9 months of the year.\nBefore I turn it back over to Alan, I'll offer a few thoughts for full year 2022 financial guidance. As we previously announced, based on strong third quarter performance and expectations for the fourth quarter, we anticipate full year adjusted EBITDA will be near the high end of our previously announced guidance range of $6.1 billion to $6.4 billion, which implies a strong fourth quarter.\nWe see multiple contributors to this expected strong finish to the year, including continued growth in our upstream joint ventures, but also growth across our other business segments versus our third quarter results. One other note regarding the third quarter, you probably noticed in our 10-Q that we did initiate share repurchases in September. As we discussed on our second quarter call, we stand ready to take action on share repurchases, and we see a pullback in our valuation, and that's what we did in September. Our share buyback principles center around a returns-based approach considering our current equity yield plus a level of expected growth in the business. We are more confident than ever in the long-term growth of our business, and so we remain ready to purchase additional shares as an important element of our capital allocation strategy. Debt financing costs have also been topical lately with the sharp rise we've seen in borrowing costs. We've included some helpful information on our well-positioned debt portfolio in the appendix, but I'll briefly touch on a few key facts.\nFirst off, we have an entirely fixed rate debt portfolio with an average rate of 4.78%, and a weighted average maturity of 12.2 years. Second, following our well-timed August debt issuance and subsequent call of $850 million of 2023 notes recently in October, we now only have $600 million of maturities in 2023.\nAnd finally, we will continue to enjoy excellent financial flexibility with our $3.75 billion credit facility. So again, with our expectations to finish 2022 near the high end of our adjusted EBITDA guidance. This would amount to over 13.5% growth versus 2021 and a 4-year CAGR of about 8%, driven by continued growth in our core business as well as contributions from our Trace acquisition and upstream JV operations.\nSo with that, I'll pass it back to Alan for closing remarks. Alan?\n\nAlan S. Armstrong\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, The Williams Companies, Inc.\n\nOkay. Well, great. Thanks, John. And I'll close by reiterating my remarks at the top of the call that quarter after quarter, we continue to demonstrate that we have built a core business that has steady predictable growth and is resilient in the face of multiple macroeconomic conditions. In fact, this makes the 27th quarter in a row that we've either met or exceeded the Street consensus.\nA careful allocation of capital has delivered improving returns on capital employed. And in fact, this is a 21.7% return on invested capital as we've showed in recent presentations. We delivered a very strong balance sheet and we have a growing dividend with best-in-class coverage. Our long-haul pipes are in the right places, serving the right markets, our formidable gathering assets are in the low-cost basins that will be called on to meet gas demand as it continues to grow for decades, and our Sequent platform is providing infrastructure optimization services that create value for Williams and our customers while mitigating downside risk in these volatile and fast-growing markets.\nYou've heard me say before that we are bullish on natural gas because of the critical role it plays and will continue to play in both our countries and the world's pursuit of a clean energy future. But even more so, we are also bullish on America's ability to lead on all fronts when it comes to clean, reliable and affordable energy. The United States is positioned better than any other country to solve the energy crisis and the climate crisis we're facing around the world. But I'll stand on my soapbox again and remind you that access to our abundant and low-cost natural gas reserves here in the U.S. is dependent on having the appropriate infrastructure to move energy where it is needed.\nWe're seeing and feeling today the impact of inadequate infrastructure both here at home and especially in Europe, with consumers bearing the brunt of these actions in the form of high energy prices, high utility bills and energy-driven inflation. The good news is that we have a solution that is readily available, a solution that will support global emissions reductions, keep energy costs affordable and grow our nation's competitiveness, enabling the efficient unobstructive build-out of our nation's energy infrastructure to ensure delivery of natural gas is foundational to the U.S.' leadership on greenhouse gas emissions reductions and energy security.\nAnd we at Williams will proudly continue our efforts to strongly advocate for actionable energy policy solutions and permitting reform in the days, months and years ahead.\nAnd with that, I'll open it up for your questions."

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Danilo Juvane, Vice President of Investor Relations and ESG. Please go ahead.\n\nDanilo Marcelo Juvane\n\nVP of IR, The Williams Companies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Joanne, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us and for your interest in the Williams Companies. Yesterday afternoon, we released our earnings press release and the presentation that our President and CEO, Alan Armstrong; and our Chief Financial Officer, John Porter, will speak to this morning. Also joining us on the call are Micheal Dunn, our Chief Operating Officer; Lane Wilson, our General Counsel; and Chad Zamarin, our Senior Vice President of Corporate Strategic Development.\nIn our presentation; materials, you'll find a disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to our remarks, and you should review it. Also included in the presentation materials are non-GAAP measures that we reconciled to generally accepted accounting principles. And these reconciliation schedules appear at the back of today's presentation materials.\nSo with that, I'll turn it over to Alan Armstrong.\n\nAlan S. Armstrong\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, The Williams Companies, Inc.\n\nGreat. Thanks, Danilo, and thank you all for joining us today. While we're here today to talk about another quarter of steady, predictable growth, thanks to a long-term commitment to our natural gas-focused strategy and continued crisp execution against that strategy. We saw strong earnings growth in our core businesses and our upstream operations. And the health of our businesses was also demonstrated by equally strong gathering and transportation volumes during the quarter. Importantly, we expect continued earnings growth in our core G&P and gas transmission businesses as our teams are delivering great execution on our expansion projects.\nWe're also staying laser focused on doing what's right to ensure sustainable operational performance. We're pleased to share our progress in our 2021 sustainability report that was published just last week. I hope you'll take some time to read the report as it really is a testament to the hard work of our entire organization and their passion for doing things the right way.\nI'll highlight a few things from the report in our key investor focus areas segment. But for now, let me turn things over to John for a review of our second quarter and our year-to-date results.\nJohn?\n\nJohn D. Porter\n\nSenior VP & CFO, The Williams Companies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Alan. Starting here on Slide 1 with a summary of our year-over-year financial performance. Overall, 2022 financial performance continues to be quite strong.\nBeginning with EBITDA, we saw a 14% year-over-year increase for the second quarter and a 10% increase for the first half of '22 versus the first half of '21. As we'll see on the next couple of slides, our EBITDA growth has been led by our core large-scale natural gas transmission and gathering and processing businesses complemented nicely by growth in our upstream joint ventures.\nOur adjusted EPS increased 48% for the quarter and 29% year-to-date. Available funds from operations, AFFO, grew more than EBITDA, continuing the trend of strong growth in this measure up 23% year-over-year for the quarter or 19% year-to-date. Also, you see our dividend coverage on this page based on AFFO was 2.19x for second quarter and slightly better at 2.24x year-to-date. Our debt to adjusted EBITDA metric continues to improve based on our strong growth in EBITDA and our capital investment discipline now reaching 3.82x versus last year's 4.13x.\nSo now let's move to the next slide and dig a little deeper into our EBITDA results for the quarter. Again, the second quarter built nicely on the strong start we've seen this year with 14% growth, reflecting the combined effect of the performance of our core business and upside from our upstream joint ventures. Walking now from last year's $1.317 billion to this year's $1.496 billion, we start with our upstream joint venture operations included in our Other segment, which were up $66 million.\nI will point out that we've added a new page to our analyst package for this segment. And in that supplemental information, we've included our net upstream sales volumes, which were just under 200 million cubic feet a day for the Haynesville and Wamsutter properties for the second quarter of '22. Since our first new production in the Haynesville came online in April of this year, we've seen a rapid ramp in volumes that will continue through the remainder of the year.\nShifting now to our core business performance. Our transmission in Gulf of Mexico business improved $4 million, primarily at Transco and largely from the Leidy South expansion project, which came online in phases last year. Operating and maintenance costs were higher, driven in part by an acceleration of maintenance work during the second quarter of this year.\nOverall, transmission in Gulf of Mexico's $652 million of adjusted EBITDA was just over our business plan for this segment for the second quarter. Our Northeast G&P business increased $41 million or 10%, driven by top line gathering and processing revenue growth on slightly higher volumes.\nG&P rate growth was supported by a combination of factors, including higher commodity base rates, annual fee escalations and other expansion-related fee increases that more than offset the lower cost of service rates that we have in our Brazos franchise. We saw an expected sequential increase in Northeast volumes for the second quarter of 2022 versus the first quarter, and we expect continued quarterly increases for volumes for the remainder of the year.\nBut ultimately, our plan for the Northeast in '22 continues to see higher EBITDA versus 2021 on pretty flat volume growth. However, we remain well positioned to resume stronger volume and EBITDA growth in the Northeast in 2023, driven by several expansion and optimization projects underway that Alan will discuss in more detail.\nShifting now to the West, which saw an impressive $73 million or 33% improvement over 2021 and I'll mention that $20 million of that $73 million was attributed to our Trace Midstream acquisition, which closed on April 29. So even without Trace, the West still increased $53 million or 24%. And in the West, we continue to see upside from our commodity price exposed rates, especially in the Barnett and Haynesville, as well as substantially higher volumes in the Haynesville that drove an 11% overall increase in volumes for the West, excluding the Trace acquisition.\nAlso in the West, we see a strong quarter-over-quarter volume growth trajectory throughout the second half of the year, driven primarily by the Haynesville. Next, we saw a slight decrease for our gas and NGL marketing services business as was expected in our business plan. And as a reminder, the first quarter of each year is typically when this segment will create the majority of its EBITDA.\nOverall, our marketing services business is extremely well positioned to take advantage of the recent natural gas price and location volatility we've seen in July. And so we expect them to exceed the high end of the $50 million to $70 million annual adjusted EBITDA contribution we discussed last quarter. So again, another strong quarter with 14% growth in EBITDA, driven by core business performance and upside in our upstream joint venture operations.\nLet's move to Slide 3 and take a look at the year-to-date comparison. So through the first 6 months of 2022, we've now generated 10% growth in adjusted EBITDA over 21% or 13% if you exclude the unusual first quarter 2021 winter storm benefits. So that's 2 strong quarters to start the year, so stepping now from last year's $2.732 billion to this year's just over $3 billion. And you start with the $77 million of those first quarter '21 winter storm benefits, which we've isolated here in gray. And then moving to the $122 million contribution from our upstream operations, which, again, were Wamsutter related in the first quarter of '22 and then began to have a more significant Haynesville component in the second quarter, as discussed on Slide 2.\nOur transmission in Gulf of Mexico business has seen 3% growth year-to-date, driven by Transco's Leidy South expansion project and strong first quarter '22 seasonal revenues with again some acceleration of maintenance costs into the second quarter of '22. The Northeast G&P business has now seen 7% growth year-to-date driven by higher rates on overall flat volumes as discussed on the previous slide.\nThe West has seen an impressive 25% growth year-to-date, driven by higher commodity base rates but also a strong 11% overall volume growth, excluding the Trace acquisition. Finally, our gas and NGL Marketing Services segment is up $28 million, driven by favorable commodity margins as well as the new contributions from the Sequent acquisition that closed on July 1 of last year.\nSo an impressive $275 million or 10% increase to land us with just over $3 billion of adjusted EBITDA through the first 6 months of the year, and we expect things to improve from here for the remainder of the year. So let's turn the page and take a look at our current thoughts for full year 2022 financial guidance.\nWe are once again pleased to share a substantial improvement in our 2022 financial guidance, making this the second increase since our initial guidance in February of this year. I won't go through each of these metrics, but we'll offer some commentary on the most pivotal numbers.\nSo let's start with adjusted EBITDA, where our midpoint is increasing another $200 million from our last guidance increase moving from $6.05 billion to $6.25 billion. This second substantial raise in EBITDA guidance is grounded in our continued confidence in the growth of our core business and represents a nearly 8% increase from our initial guidance given in February.\nAs we look to the second half of the year, we expect higher EBITDA than the first half for all of our segments, except perhaps the marketing business, and with an overall pick up in sequential EBITDA growth for the fourth quarter over the third quarter. Although it's less certain, our gas and NGL marketing business could also match or exceed their first half performance during the last 6 months of the year, which is a bit unusual for this business.\nTheir storage and transportation assets and trading capabilities are very well suited for the volatility we are seeing in this natural gas markets. Continuing on with the other segments, we expect Transmission and Gulf of Mexico should finish the year strong with fourth quarter numbers more like their first quarter numbers. And we continue to expect growing quarterly EBITDA and volumes from our West and Northeast segments with some level of acceleration through the latter part of the year.\nWith respect to our upstream operations, we are encouraged by the results we've seen thus far in 2022. In the appendix, you'll see that we're guiding to fourth quarter '22 gross production of approximately 250 million cubic feet per day for the Wamsutter operation, and we've increased our expectations for Haynesville to an estimated fourth quarter '22 gross production rate of about 400 million cubic feet per day.\nOur appendix slides also provide information about the specific hedges we currently placed against our forecasted net production volumes. No change to our CapEx assumptions from our previous guidance update in May on our first quarter earnings call, which had increased from the February guidance only to reflect the Trace acquisition capital spending.\nYou see that our debt to adjusted EBITDA is now expected to be about 3.6x at midpoint. The remainder of the guidance items either changed in relation to the change in EBITDA, I've just discussed or remain unchanged. So again, a second substantial increase in EBITDA guidance representing an almost 8% increase in our midpoint from our initial guidance provided in February of this year, driven by continued growth in our core business as well as contributions from our Trace acquisition and improved expectations for our upstream JV operations.\nSo with that, I'll pass it back to Alan to review our key investor focus areas. Alan?\n\nAlan S. Armstrong\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, The Williams Companies, Inc.\n\nOkay. Well, thanks, John. I'm going to move on here on Slide 5 to the key investor focus areas. So I know this may sound a little bit like a broken record, but -- on this first bullet. But without a doubt, we are the most natural gas-centric of the large-scale midstream companies. And there's a reason we've stuck with our natural gas focused strategy for as long as we have.\nNot only is this strategy delivering in the current environment, but the signals coming from the market show that it's going to continue to deliver substantial growth for the long term as well. We continue to see strong fundamentals driving a great pipeline of growth opportunities, particularly increasing demand for U.S. LNG exports and power generation along the Transco corridor.\nImportantly, we continue to see strong demand for our services domestically as well, evidenced by a 3-day peak summer delivery that we achieved on the Transco pipeline in early July this year as we continue to see weather-driven demand for cooling. So really seeing a lot of big pools. We're seeing some strong basis differentials setting up in these areas where we've got some strong peak demands during the heat wave that the Southeast experienced.\nAnd notably, we continue to see these record levels of demand for natural gas even with the Freeport LNG facility being out. So we see these as good indicators of the long-term health of our business, but I'll remind you that business on our Transco system is actually driven by contracted capacity and not the actual transported volumes. But obviously, when we see peaks like that, our customers are seeing those as well and know that the demand on our systems is -- and the growth in demand on our system is needed and the contracts come with that.\nThis demand growth continues to increase in the face of higher natural gas prices, which speaks to the continued inelastic demand for natural gas, both here and abroad, and the fact that natural gas remains a bargain versus alternative fuels. Our G&P business also continues to thrive in the current environment, allowing us to capture the upside benefit of pricing and inflation adjusters in our rates that have been sitting on their floors for many years. And recently, volumes on our systems have finally begun to respond to the higher prices that we've seen in the gas space.\nSo moving on to financial strength and stability. As John just detailed, we increased our guidance midpoint beyond the high end of the previous range for the second time this year to $6.25 billion, and this was driven by the following items: first of all, strong base business performance with volumes in the Northeast G&P business expected to rebound for the balance of the year; increased volume outlook for our upstream JVs, especially in the Haynesville; the benefit of higher commodity prices in our upstream JVs; and finally, commodity volatility and strong pools for power generation that are currently driving our gas and NGL marketing business upside.\nWith our recent updated guidance, we expect to achieve a 5-year EBITDA CAGR of 7% and an impressive EPS CAGR of 22% at the midpoint of this recent guidance. Our business continues to fire on all cylinders, given our -- driving our financial strength and stability. And despite the current inflationary environment, we have significant contract protection to minimize financial impact from inflation to our business.\nSo worth noting our business is well positioned given the strong fundamentals today, and we don't expect much to change should a recession come to fruition. As you may recall, in 2020, Williams exceeded our pre-COVID guidance for that year despite facing challenges like key producer bankruptcies declining commodity prices and major hurricanes in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico.\nSo now looking over our position of growth. We recently announced that we reached a final investment decision on our Louisiana Energy Gateway project, a 1.8 Bcf per day gathering system that will help us advance our wellhead and water strategy while also positioning our customers with access to favorable pricing markets along Transco.\nWithin our transmission business, the Gulfstream Phase 4 expansion is in service more than 3 months early, and I'm also pleased to announce that Williams has reached a rate case settlement in principle on our Northwest Pipeline system. And this provides a win-win outcome for both ourselves and our long-term customers on the system. So we continue to execute as well on an attractive high-return backlog of growth projects, including 6 projects now in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico; 5 Transco projects totaling 1.9 Bcf a day; 4 expansion projects in our Northeast G&P business that will really unlock some high-margin business for us in that area; and 4 in the Haynesville, which continues to grow at a pace well beyond our initial expectations.\nAnd as well on the Transco projects, just last week, the FERC issued the final EIS on our Regional Energy Access project, expanding takeaway from the Northeast PA area, which obviously helps us as well on our gathering systems up there and the volumes up there and serving growth in the New Jersey area as well. So really excited to see the progress with the FERC on bringing that project to fruition.\nAnd as well in the Haynesville, just another note here, we are really seeing that paying a lot of long-term dividends, not just because of the growth in the business but because the Trace acquisition, along with the LEG project, is going to allow us to bring integrated services and bring -- and connect them to key markets for our customers. So the better markets those customers are connected to, the better margins and the more activity in drilling we see up there. And in fact, we're seeing significant well outperformance in our upstream JV operations with GeoSouthern, which continue to improve our upstream margins.\nAnd as well, recall that the reasoning behind our upstream JVs was to drive utilization of latent midstream capacity. And this is exactly what's happening in the Haynesville right now, and we expect the same capture of Midstream value in the Wamsutter as our JV drilling program ramps in the coming months there as well.\nSo now moving on to sustainable strategy. I'll cover a few updates here for you on what's been going on our sustainable strategy. First of all, as I mentioned at the top of the call, we published our 2021 Sustainability Report last week as well as we filed our carbon emissions disclosure with the Carbon Disclosure Project. As both of these reports detail, we are continuing to successfully leverage our natural gas-focused strategy and today's technology to deliver on immediate opportunities to reduce emissions.\nIn fact, we have reduced our company-wide Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 47% since 2005, and we're on our way to meeting our 2030 goal of a 56% reduction below -- again, below these 2005 levels. I'm certainly proud of the progress that we've made to date and that we'll continue to make as our 2022 all employee-annual incentive program now includes a total methane emissions reduction of 5% from our 3-year average, which personally connects every employee to our long-term commitment to safe, reliable and environmentally friendly operations.\nOf course, our efforts go beyond what we see as the right here right now opportunities. We're also focusing on enabling the next generation of clean energy technologies. I mentioned our LEG project a few minutes ago, which is a key component of our low-carbon wellhead-to-water strategy, and this project is actually very integrated and supports our partnerships with Context Labs, Encino Environmental and South Atlantis, whose technology solutions will be integrated into the project and will enable the measurement of end-to-end verifiable and transparent emissions data to demonstrate the low carbon benefits of produced and delivered Haynesville natural gas.\nWe are really happy with the progress we're making on this project in the Haynesville and having -- we recently completed implementation of the on-site monitoring and certification capabilities in our systems up there. So really a lot of things coming together for us in the Haynesville in terms of great growth in the area as well as us demonstrating some of the new technology that we intend to deploy for that area.\nWe're also advancing our wellhead to burner tip strategy in the Northeast with anchor customers to be announced later this year in that area. So lots of tangible solutions we will be delivering in the space. And all of these are positioned around supporting and enhancing our strong natural gas focused strategy.\nSo let me move on to closing here. I'll reiterate that we have built a business that is steady and predictable with continued growth, improving returns and free cash flows. Our best-in-class long-haul pipes are in the right place, serving the right markets. Our formidable gathering assets are in the low-cost basins that will be called on to meet gas demand as it continues to grow for decades.\nAnd our Sequent platform is providing infrastructure optimization services that create value for Williams and our customers while mitigating downside risk in these volatile and fast-growing markets. You've heard me say before that we are bullish on natural gas because of the critical role it plays and will continue to play in both our countries and the world's pursuit of a clean energy future.\nBut I'll go a step further here to say that we're also bullish on America's ability to lead on all fronts when it comes to clean, reliable and affordable energy. The United States is positioned better than any other country to solve the energy crisis and the climate crisis that we're facing around the world. But access to our abundant and low-cost natural gas reserves is dependent on having the appropriate infrastructure to move energy where it is needed.\nThe efforts to build out all forms of key infrastructure have been blocked by obstructionists who don't offer practical and sustainable solutions to serve these growing energy demands. The impacts of inadequate infrastructure are now finally front and center with consumers bearing the brunt of these actions in the form of high energy prices, high utility bills and energy-driven inflation both here and around the world.\nThe good news is that this is exactly the kind of catalyst that it takes to bring public awareness to these matters and the European prices is even highlighting the matter further. That is why we are strongly advocating for actionable energy policy solutions and permitting reform that will support global emissions reductions keep energy costs affordable and grow our nation's competitiveness.\nEnabling the efficient unobstructive build-out of our nation's energy infrastructure is foundational to the U.S.' leadership on greenhouse gas emissions and energy security. And we believe that support is building out for just doing that.\nSo with that, I'll open it up for your questions."

[Operator Instructions]. Now at this time, I'll turn things over to Mr. Danilo Juvane, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nDanilo Marcelo Juvane\n\nAnalyst, BMO Capital Markets Equity Research\n\nThanks, Paul, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us and for your interest in The Williams Companies. Yesterday afternoon, we released our earnings press release and the presentation that our President and CEO, Alan Armstrong; and our Chief Financial Officer, John Porter, will speak to this morning. Also joining us on the call are Michael Dunn, our Chief Operating Officer; Lane Wilson, our General Counsel; and Chad Zamarin, our Executive Vice President of Corporate Strategic Development.\nIn our presentation materials, you'll find a disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to our remarks, and you should review it. Also included in our presentation materials are non-GAAP measures that we reconcile to generally accepted accounting principles. And these reconciliation schedules appear at the back of the day presentation materials.\nSo with that, I'll turn it over to Alan Armstrong.\n\nAlan S. Armstrong\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Inside Director, The Williams Cos., Inc.\n\nAll right. Well, thanks, Danilo, and thank you all for joining us today. As our first slide here shows Williams delivered another quarter of impressive accomplishments and starting out with our operational execution. So First of all, our project execution team completed the first half of Transco's Regional Energy Access project, well ahead of schedule, and our commercial and government affairs teams followed up with the contracting and FERC authorization needed to place this in service and beginning full rate revenues for the initial capacity here in late October. So great efforts by our teams there and great results in a very difficult area.\nWe expect the total project to be online in the fourth quarter of next year with the capacity to move approximately 830 million cubic feet a day of natural gas from the northeast part of the Marcellus into the Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Maryland markets. We also completed several other expansion projects, including a fully contracted gas transmission line that enables our newly acquired NorTex storage system to directly serve new gas-fired generation markets in that area. And in our West Gathering segment, we completed a large expansion of our South Manfield gathering system in the Haynesville for GEO Southern, which I'm proud to say, was the nation's fastest-growing gas producer last year. And in the Northeast, we completed the first expansion of many to come on our Cardinal gathering system for Encino's rich gas drilling operations in the Utica condensate window.\nBut the really big news this quarter comes in the new project's call. We recently signed precedent agreements of over 1.4 Bcf a day for the Southeast Supply Enhancement project which provides takeaway capacity from station 16 -- from our Transco Station 165 to the fast-growing Mid-Atlantic and Southeast markets. And based on the open season results, we have even more demand to be met in the future that would result likely in a follow-on project. So we are proceeding into the permitting process for this initial project due to the urgent demands to be met for this first group of customers. So in terms of impact, this will be the largest addition of EBITDA ever for a Williams Pipeline -- mentioned, yes, even more than our Atlantic Sunrise project and, in fact, significantly more than the entire EBITDA generated from our Northwest Pipeline system. And I'll remind you that these are 20-year contracts from the time the project starts up, which would be at least through 2047. And we recently signed anchor shipper precedent agreements for a Uinta Basin expansion on our Mountain West system. We continue to be very pleased with the successful integration of the Mountain West assets into our operations and the opportunities we see to execute on more profitable growth with this asset than we had originally planned on. In fact, this is the second piece of substantial business that we have signed up just this year on the Mountain West Pipeline. And neither of which of these expansions, neither of these were in our pro forma for this acquisition. So really pleased with the team from Mountain West Pipeline and the leadership we have working to grow that business, but very pleasantly surprised with that acquisition to date.\nMoving across the slide, we are acting on opportunities that we believe will further high-grade our portfolio of assets. First of all, Williams recently sold its our Bayou Ethane pipeline system for $348 million in cash, and this represented a last 12-month multiple of over 14x our adjusted EBITDA. The proceeds from this asset sell along with expected proceeds from a recent legal judgment will help fund an important strengthening of our hand in the DJ Basin with the following transactions. First, the acquisition of Cureton Front Range, LLC, whose assets include gas gathering pipelines and 2 processing plants to serve producers across 225,000 dedicated acres that are just to the north of our existing KKR system; and second, the purchase of KKR's 50% ownership interest in the Rocky Mountain Midstream which results in us now owning 100% of that. So KKR was our partner in Rocky Mountain Midstream. They've been a great partner there, but it was coming times via those agreements to exercise that. So we're really pleased to have had the relationship we have with KKR and a great partner there. But this is really an exciting expansion of our business out there that will allow us to deliver volumes into our downstream assets and including taking existing gas supplies and feeding them into our Rocky Mountain Midstream. So really excited about that.\nThese acquisitions have a combined value of $1.27 billion, and this represents a blended multiple of approximately 7 times the 24 adjusted EBITDA. So the synergies here are very tangible to us, again, because we can just take these existing gas volumes feeding them to our processing and then enjoy the downstream NGL -- coupon clipping on the downstream NGL transportation, fractionation and storage. These are -- the transactions are expected to close by the end of '23, making Williams the third largest gather in the DJ Basin and progressing us towards the company's strategy of maintaining top positions in the basins we serve. So just a few other items to hit on this quarter. We finally are taking over operatorship of the Blue Racer gathering and processing system in West Virginia and Ohio later this year. This is important due to our ability to significantly lower cost and more easily capture synergies between this and our other operations in the area.\nAnd lastly, we're continuing to advance our efforts to commercialize clean hydrogen through our support of 2 clean hydrogen hubs that were announced by the Department of Energy last month. 1 in the Pacific Northwest and 1 in the Appalachian region. We're looking forward to leveraging our operating expertise and a right of way into the emerging hydrogen space.\nLooking at some of our financial highlights from the quarter. John will obviously get into more details here in a minute, but overall, we've delivered another quarter of strong financial performance even in the face of dramatically lower gas prices as compared to the third quarter of '22. Year-to-date, our adjusted EBITDA is up 9%. Our adjusted EPS is up 11% and gathering volumes are up 6% versus the first 9 months of '22. And we expect the strong performance to continue, providing us with the confidence to raise our '23 guidance this quarter, up by $100 million to $6.7 billion of adjusted EBITDA. And -- and we are tracking in line with our 5% to 7% adjusted EBITDA annual growth rate, and this quarter marks the 34th first quarter of meeting or beating the adjusted EBITDA consensus. And the fifth time, we have raised guidance during the same period. And I'll also point out that we haven't gotten there by lowering our guidance. In fact, we have not lowered our guidance during this entire period, and that includes through the pandemic.\nSo in summary, our strict adherence to our strategy, our commitment to an improving return on capital employed, and extraordinary execution by our team, all have continued to deliver predictable growth through a variety of commodity cycles. Importantly, this discipline also has Williams position to capture significant future growth and return this value to our shareholders.\nAnd with that, I'm going to turn things over to John to walk us through the financial metrics of the quarter.\n\nJohn D. Porter\n\nVice President-Investor Relations, Financial Planning and Analysis, The Williams Cos., Inc.\n\nAll right. Thanks, Alan. Starting here on Slide 4 with a summary of our year-over-year financial performance. It was a strong performance by our base business, which we define as excluding marketing in our upstream joint ventures. That base business increase was 6% over the prior year third quarter. As we'll discuss in a moment, last year's third quarter saw very favorable commodity prices for our marketing and upstream joint ventures, which did makes it for a tougher year-over-year comparison in total but we did still grow total adjusted EBITDA as well as that 6% increase for our base business.\nYear-to-date, our total adjusted EBITDA is now up 9%, driven by the growth of our core infrastructure businesses which continue to perform very well, even as natural gas prices decreased 63% for the first 9 months of '23 versus the first 9 months of 2022, once again demonstrating the resiliency and strength of our natural gas-focused strategy, assets and operational capabilities. So for third quarter, adjusted EPS slipped a little bit from that very strong 2022 number, but you can see it's still up 11% year-to-date, continuing the strong growth we've had in EPS over the last many years. Available funds from operations was generally flat with last year's strong cash flow. And you see our third quarter dividend coverage based on AFFO was a very strong 2.26x on a dividend that grew 5.3%.\nOur balance sheet continues to strengthen with debt to adjusted EBITDA now reaching 3.45x versus last year's 3.68x. On CapEx, you see an increase primarily reflecting the progress we're making on some of our key growth projects, including Regional Energy Access and Louisiana Energy Gateway. So based on the continued strong financial performance of the business, we now feel confident raising our consolidated adjusted EBITDA guidance to $6.6 billion to $6.8 billion, shifting the midpoint up $100 million from $6.6 billion to now $6.7 billion. In a moment, I'll provide a little color on our expectations for the remainder of the year and a few thoughts regarding the outlook beyond 2023.\nSo let's turn to the next slide and take a little closer look at the third quarter results. You see a 1% overall increase but a strong 6% increase in our base business EBITDA over the prior year, even as average natural gas prices for the third quarter decreased 68%. Now even for the base business, excluding marketing and our upstream joint ventures, that dramatic decrease in natural gas prices had a significant impact on our revenues. In fact, we saw about $70 million of lower natural gas price based gathering rate at certain of our franchises in the West and Northeast gathering and processing segments. Last year saw those rates significantly lift from the floor values they've been at for many years. And in 2023, we've seen them return back to their floor values. Looking now at our core business performance, our transmission and Gulf of Mexico business improved $83 million or 12%, including about a $47 million contribution from our Mountain West Pipeline and Nortex acquisitions but we did see other increases in our transmission and deepwater businesses as well.\nOur Northeast gathering and processing business performed well with a $21 million or 5% increase including a 4% overall increase in volumes versus last year. This 4% volume growth happened even though we saw a much lower shoulder season natural gas pricing in 2023 versus 2022, and as we expected, that particularly impacted our dry gas systems, including some significant shut-in volumes in Northeast Pennsylvania. However, as we've talked about before, when low natural gas prices weigh on dry gas production, we tend to see a shift to our liquids-rich systems where higher margins tend to compensate for lower volumes. And that's what we see in third quarter this year with about a 22% increase and processing plant volumes led by those liquids-rich systems with related increases in NGL production volumes and associated fractionation and transportation revenues as well.\nSo shifting now to the West, which decreased $22 million or 7%, where the unfavorable impact of those lower natural gas price based rates fueled by last year's much higher natural gas prices overcame what was strong volume growth in the Haynesville. And then you see the $22 million decrease in the gas and NGL marketing business. Last year's third quarter saw much more favorable conditions for the gas marketing business with stronger natural gas price volatility in particular. Our upstream joint venture operations that are included in our Other segment were down about $52 million versus last year. That includes the Haynesville upstream EBITDA, which was down about $36 million despite higher production but due to much lower net realized prices and a lower working interest percentage on new wells beginning in January 2023. The Wamsutter upstream EBITDA was down about $16 million, where increases in gas and oil production significantly offset much lower net realized prices versus last year. So again, the third quarter continued our strong base business performance in 2023 with 6% growth and EBITDA driven by core infrastructure business performance in spite of natural gas prices that were 68% lower than third quarter of 2022.\nLet's turn the page and touch on the year-to-date comparison. Year-to-date, we've seen a 9% increase over 2022 even as average natural gas prices year-to-date fell 63% versus last year. And walking down from last year's $4.6 billion to this year's $5.1 billion and looking at our core business performance Transmission and Gulf of Mexico business improved $210 million or 10% and really on similar themes as our third quarter, namely the impact of the Mountain West Pipeline and NorTex acquisition and still seeing other increases in our transmission and deepwater revenues as well.\nOur Northeast G&P business has performed very well with the $138 million or 10% increase driven by a $270 million increase in their service revenues and this revenue increase was really fueled by a 6% increase in total volumes focused in our liquids-rich areas where we tend to have higher per unit margins than our dry gas areas. And in the appendix, you'll find a slide that compares our 6% volume growth to the overall basin growth of just over 2%. Shifting now to the West, which increased $20 million or 2%, benefiting from positive hedge results and strong Haynesville volume growth, including the TRACE acquisition in the Haynesville but the West was significantly unfavorably impacted by those lower natural gas price based gathering rate and also lower NGL margins. And then you see the $122 million increase in our gas and NGL marketing business as you'll recall, really caused by the very strong first quarter start to the year for the gas marketing business.\nOur upstream joint venture operations included in our Other segment were down $92 million versus last year. The Haynesville upstream EBITDA was down about $18 million, where the benefits of our 175% increase in net production volumes were more than offset by dramatically lower net realized natural gas prices. The Wamsutter upstream EBITDA was down $74 million due to the combined effect of the historically difficult winter weather we saw in Wyoming this year on production volumes as well as lower net realized prices. So again, a continuation to the strong start to 2023 with 9% growth in EBITDA, driven by core infrastructure business performance with strength from our marketing business that dramatically overcame weaker-than-expected results from the upstream joint ventures.\nAs I mentioned earlier, we are raising our adjusted EBITDA guidance to $6.6 billion to $6.8 billion with $100 million shift upward in the midpoint. This increase comes thanks to the steady performance of our base business even after a historic decline in natural gas prices that did lead to some recent shut-ins and also after that historically difficult winter that continue to have unfavorable impacts through April of this year. And this 2023 guidance raise comes after 2 consecutive years of record-breaking adjusted EBITDA growth in 2021 and 2022. In the appendix, you'll see other positive shifts in our financial guidance metrics that are generally aligned with the higher EBITDA guidance. And from a leverage perspective, we finished the year not knowing the exact timing of when we'll receive payment of the $602 million judgment awarded to us from Energy Transfer and the recent Delaware Supreme Court decision as well as the exact timing of the close date of the DJ transaction that we announced yesterday.\nOur expected payment in the Energy Transfer matter, net of legal fees, will be in excess of $530 million and is still growing every day for interest charges as well. Considering all of these moving parts, we still believe we'll end up close to our original 2023 leverage guidance of 3.65x even though that guidance was issued before consideration of the Mountain West Pipeline and DJ transactions and about $130 million of share buybacks that we've done this year as well. So in summary, we are finishing 2023 with the guidance raise that builds on a strong multiyear trend of outperformance and we're setting our sights on continued growth in 2024 and before another big growth step up in 2025.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it back to Alan.\n\nAlan S. Armstrong\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Inside Director, The Williams Cos., Inc.\n\nOkay. Well, thanks, John. So just a few closing remarks before we turn it over to your questions. First, I'll start by reiterating our belief that Williams remains a compelling investment opportunity. We are the most natural gas-centric large-scale midstream company around today and the tightly integrated nature of our business is unique. Second, our combination of proven resilience of 5-year EPS CAGR of 23%, steadily growing 2x covered dividend a strong balance sheet and high visibility to growth is unique amongst the S&P 500 and unique within our sector. Our natural gas-focused strategy has allowed us to produce a 10-year track record of growing adjusted EBITDA through a record -- a large number of commodity and economic cycles. And it is continuing to deliver significant growth in the current environment. And the signals coming from the market show that it is going to continue to deliver substantial growth well into the future.\nShoring up our nations and the world's energy foundation with natural gas is going to happen, whether the opposition wants to or not. Because we are running out of time and real-world options to meet the growing need for energy while reducing emissions. Natural gas is the most effective nonsubsidized way of reducing emissions and it has become the practical alternative. Ramping up the production of natural gas has allowed the U.S. to meet our evolving domestic needs as well as provide energy security and support to our global allies. It stands unmatched as the most affordable and reliable source of energy and has been the most effective tool to date at reducing emissions. At Williams, we are committed to a clean energy future that focuses on driving down emissions while protecting affordability and reliability. The drive for electrification is on and dispatchable power capable of keeping up with the large number of government incented electrical loads like carbon capture, hydrogen production and data centers is going to be largely served by natural gas. This includes scaling up renewable sources to reduce carbon while backing up those sources with the flexibility, scale and reliability of natural gas. So we are here for the long haul and are committed to leveraging our large-scale natural gas infrastructure network for the benefit of generations and our shareholders for generations to come.\nAnd with that, I'll open it up for your questions."

Welcome to the WTW Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Please refer to wtwco.com for the press release and supplemental information that was issued earlier today. Today's call is being recorded and will be available for the next 3 months on WTW's website.\nSome of the comments in today's call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed today and the company undertakes no obligation to update these statements unless required by law. For a more detailed discussion of the other risk factors, investors should review the forward-looking statements section of the earnings press release issued this morning as well as other disclosures in the most recent Form 10-K and in other Willis Towers Watson SEC filings.\nDuring the call, certain non-GAAP financial measures may be discussed. For reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures as well as other information regarding these measures, please refer to the most recent earnings release and other materials in the Investor Relations section of the company's website.\nI will now turn the call over to Carl Hess, WTW Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead.\n\nCarl A. Hess\n\nCEO & Director, Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for WTW's Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. Joining me today is Andrew Krasner, our Chief Financial Officer.\nI'm pleased to be here today for my first earnings call as WTW's CEO. I've officially been on the job for about 6 weeks, and it is truly an honor to lead this company. WTW looks very different than it did over 30 years ago when I first joined the company, and it's been an extraordinary journey, one defined by continuous innovation and change.\nAs we move forward as an independent company, we recognize the need to grow, simplify and transform. Our recently refreshed brand and new magic stock ticker, WTW are key signals of this new era. Our new brand evolves our identity to both reflect our rich history and also inspire our future. We may have a new brand, a new ticker and a new leadership team to set us on a bolder path, but certain things will never change: our client focus, teamwork, integrity, respect and excellence. These are our values. They are in our DNA and at the core of everything we do. WTW leadership and colleagues are excited about this bold new approach and we hope you are too.\nI'm pleased to report that we continue to see progress in our independent path forward. As we mentioned back in October, we executed on our incentive plans which provide both short-term and long-term retention benefits, and these have been well received. We've also seen significant measurable improvements in colleague engagement.\nMeanwhile, the pace at which we've been attracting new talent to fuel our path forward has been truly impressive. We hired more people in the second half of 2021 that we hired during the entire year in 2020, and the elevated attrition levels we saw in '21 are behind us. We also made some early progress in our transformation program, which Andrew will expand upon later in the call. Last but not least, we've been steadfast in applying financial discipline as illustrated by our full year margin and year-over-year margin improvement.\nAs crude stewards of our financial assets, we plan to continue our emphasis on returning capital to shareholders through share repurchases, which we believe provide the highest return opportunity. We're encouraged by the progress we're making on our strategic initiatives. While we have hard work ahead of us in 2022, we're kicking things off with renewed energy and conviction. Our talented colleagues will strive to meet and exceed the expectations of the clients and individuals we are privileged to serve.\nIn the current environment, our clients are striving to create continuity and clarity in an environment of ongoing disruption. Future-focused leaders acknowledge that risk has become a mainstream element of business decisions and will remain so. Today, the frequency and complexity of threats continue to increase due to factors including geopolitics, economic volatility, population health, climate change, supply chain, talent and technology.\nTo combat threats and create opportunity, organizations must connect current and future risks; act on environmental, social and governance and sustainability commitments; and build organizational resilience. The time to act is now. WTW's unique perspective connect solutions, strengthens organizations and helps clients better prepare for and thrive in an uncertain future.\nFor example, WTW designed the world's first parametric insurance solution for Belize's sovereign debt restructuring. This unique transaction includes targeted insurance protection to cover Belize's loan servicing obligation in the event of certain natural catastrophes such as hurricanes. Hurricanes can create large-scale devastation and disruption to economic activity, thereby halting development. The custom solution allows Belize to focus scarce financial resources on recovery rather than debt servicing and reflects WTW's commitment to using our expertise to shape and fortify resilience in the communities we serve.\nBefore we discuss our fourth quarter results, I want to take a moment to directly address our talented and valued colleagues. We have an exciting future ahead, filled with opportunity, and I'm delighted you're here to be part of it. Thank you for your hard work and dedication, and most of all, thank you for your commitment. I'm truly appreciative of your efforts to drive our vision to be the best company in the business and achieve our full potential as One WTW. I'm proud of the company we've built, and I'm excited to be leading us through the next phase of our journey.\nSo now let's turn to our financial results. Please note that all metrics referenced are on a continuing operations basis, except where stated otherwise. As a reminder, we substantially completed the sale of Willis Re on December 1, 2021. We recorded a gain of $2.3 billion in connection with the disposal of Willis Re. That gain is included in many of our GAAP profitability measures, which we'll point out as we move through the commentary.\nOverall, our results aligned with our expectations. But to be crystal clear, they do not reflect the near- and long-term potential of this company to drive organic growth and margin expansion. As mentioned earlier, our hiring levels are among highest in recent history, and we're confident that the peak of colleague departures is behind us.\nFor the full year, we posted 6% organic revenue growth and our adjusted operating margin was 19.9%. While the results reflect the expected delay impact of disruptions experienced earlier in 2021, the underlying strength of our business and our early progress on executing our strategy gives me confidence that we remain on track to deliver strong shareholder value over the longer term.\nReported revenue for the fourth quarter was $2.7 billion, up 1% as compared to the prior year fourth quarter, up 2% on a constant currency basis and up 4% on an organic basis. Income from operations was $690 million or 25.5% of revenue for the fourth quarter as compared to $579 million or 21.7% of revenue in the prior year fourth quarter. Adjusted operating income was $868 million or 32% -- 32.1% of revenue for the quarter, up 170 basis points from $812 million or 30.4% of revenue in the same period last year.\nFor the quarter, diluted earnings per share, which includes discontinued operations, were $19.19 as compared to $3.66 in the fourth quarter of prior year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $5.67 for the fourth quarter, reflecting an increase of 9% when compared to $5.19 in the prior year.\nNow let's take a look at each of our segments in more detail. To provide clear comparability with prior periods, all commentary regarding the results of our segments will be on an organic basis, unless specifically stated otherwise. Segment margins are calculated using segment revenue and exclude unallocated corporate costs such as amortization of intangibles, certain transaction and integration expenses resulting from mergers and acquisitions as well as other items which we consider to be noncore to our operating results. The segment results include discretionary compensation.\nThe Human Capital & Benefits or HCB segment revenue was up 3% on an organic basis and constant currency basis compared to the fourth quarter of the prior year. For the full year of 2021, HCB revenue grew 3% organically. Technology and Administration Solutions revenue grew 11% in the fourth quarter, primarily due to increased project work in Great Britain and Western Europe. Our Health and Benefits revenue increased 6% for the quarter.\nThe increase reflects robust demand in H&B consulting and a gain recorded in the connection with a one-off book of business settlement, offset by slower growth in brokerage. The settlement relates to an isolated incident of senior staff departures earlier in 2021.\nTalent and Rewards revenue increased 3% in the quarter, following growth of 17% in Q3 and 22% in Q2. Throughout the year, this growth has represented a rebound from the 2020 slowdown in discretionary projects, plus increasing market demand, particularly for products like compensation benchmarking surveys. The lower growth in Q4 relative to the prior 2 quarters reflects the typical seasonality of compensation survey sales, which peaked in Q2 and Q3 as well as some capacity constraints for advisory services. With expectations for continued strong demand in product and advisory services and having ramped up hiring in the fourth quarter, we are well positioned.\nRetirement revenue was down 1% compared to the prior year fourth quarter, with increased funding and guaranteed minimum pension equalization work in Great Britain, offset by declines in North America due to a reduction in work in Canada to implement regulatory changes and lower demand for bulk lump sum projects.\nHCB's operating margin was 31.2% for the fourth quarter compared to 31.3% in the prior year fourth quarter. On a full year basis, HCB's operating margin improved to 27.0% from 26.0% in the prior year. Year-over-year, excluding the impact of currency and gains from book of business settlements, HCB's margin declined by 150 basis points for the fourth quarter but increased by 90 basis points for the full year. The fourth quarter margin declined as a result of higher expense growth driven by hiring to meet expected strong market demand as we build capacity for robust revenue growth. The full year margin increase reflects continued (inaudible) expense reduction efforts.\nHistorically, HCB has had industry-leading margins, and we believe that trend will continue. HCB's overall market tailwinds should continue to drive organic growth momentum for HCB. Both our near-term and long-term outlook on the segment remain positive, and our expectations for revenue growth are unchanged from what we communicated at Investor Day, mid-single-digit growth.\nNow let's look at Corporate Risk & Broking, or CRB, which had a revenue increase of 1% on an organic and constant currency basis as compared to the prior year fourth quarter. For the full year of 2021, CRB revenue grew 5% organically. Our hiring levels are the highest in recent history and colleague departure levels have decreased. North America's revenue was up by 4% in the fourth quarter, including gains recorded in connection with book of business sales and settlements. The book sales and settlements related to producer departures occurring earlier in 2021.\nInternational's revenue increased 10% compared to prior year. There was strong performance in M&A in Asia and Australasia and natural resources in Eastern Europe. Latin America also contributed to international revenue growth with new business wins in Brazil and Central America. Great Britain's revenue declined 5% as a result of lost business and timing. The decline reflects the delayed impact of disruption from earlier in 2021. Revenue for Western Europe was down 5% due to the departure of senior staff prior to the deal termination, which continue to pressure the business in certain geographies.\nAlthough earlier departures have hindered our growth for several quarters, we are seeing some positive momentum. New client wins include one of the largest commercial and retail banks in the region.\nCRB's operating margin was 31.2% for the fourth quarter compared to 32.3% in the prior year fourth quarter. On a full year basis, CRB's operating margin improved to 23.0% from 21.2% in the prior year. Excluding the impact of currency and the benefit of booking business sales and settlements, the margin declined 240 basis points for the fourth quarter, but increased by 80 basis points for the full year.\nThe fourth quarter decline was mostly due to investments to support future growth. The full year margin expansion reflects the continuation of effective cost management. CRB's organic growth trailed industry expected averages for the last 3 quarters of '21 primarily as a result of elevated colleague departures and reduced hiring during the period when the business combination was pending, 2 trends that we believe are now behind us.\nCurrently, we expect to see lower growth in the first half of 2022 compared to the second half of 2022 as the gap versus industry expected averages narrows. While events in previous quarters have challenged us and temporary headwinds from those events remain, our outlook for CRB remains positive with mid-single-digit revenue growth over the longer term.\nTurning to Investment, Risk & Reinsurance or IRR. Revenue for the fourth quarter was $199 million, an increase of 32% on an organic basis and a decrease of 2% on a constant currency basis as compared to the prior year fourth quarter. IRR revenue includes a gain from a book of business settlement, which relates to reinsurance assets that did not transfer in connection with the sale of Willis Re.\nIRR excludes all other revenue associated with the reinsurance line of business, which has been reported as discontinued operations. It also excludes revenue from Max Matthiessen, which was sold in September of 2020; and Miller, WTW's wholesale broking subsidiary sold in March of 2021. These sales account for the wide disparity between organic and constant currency.\nThe Insurance Consulting and Technology, or ICT business, where revenue was up 5%, led the segment's growth with increased demand for advisory work alongside technology sales. Our investment businesses grew revenue by 11% from new business, growth in delegated assets under management and, to a lesser extent, increased performance fees.\nIRR's operating margin was 25.3% for the fourth quarter compared to 12.5% in the prior year fourth quarter. On a full year basis, IRR's operating margin improved to 19.5% from 14.5% in the prior year. Excluding the impact of currency and the benefit of book of business settlements, the margin declined 240 basis points for the quarter, but increased by 220 basis points for the full year.\nThe fourth quarter decline was primarily caused by the headwind created from divestitures. The prior year fourth quarter margin includes the contribution of the now divested Miller subsidiary while the current year fourth quarter margin does not, which distorts comparability. Miller subsidiary was sold in March of 2021. The full year margin expansion was the result of careful cost management efforts, combined with strong top line growth from the 2 businesses that remain an IRR, ICT and investments.\nTurning to the Benefits Delivery & Administration segment, or BDA, revenue increased by 5% on an organic and constant currency basis from the prior year fourth quarter. The growth in revenue was largely driven by individual marketplace due to a favorable shift in the revenue timing for our B2B Medicare Exchange business, along with continued strength in our direct-to-consumer business. The Benefits Outsourcing business also contributed significantly to BDA's revenue growth with increased project work driven by temporary federal policy changes expecting group health care plans.\nBDA's operating margin was 49.2% in the fourth quarter and 22.4% for the full year, having declined year-over-year by 110 basis points and 150 basis points, respectively. The year-over-year margin decline for both the fourth quarter and the full year was the result of increased investing in resources for the 2022 annual enrollment period, coupled with headwinds on lead conversions. The BDA segment has posted 10% organic growth for 2 consecutive years, and we continue to feel positive about the momentum of this segment.\nOverall, our financial results for 2021 are in line with our expectations reflecting the complexity of navigating a significant strategic shift along with some bright spots, highlighting our commitment to profitable growth. I'm pleased we effectively managed our cost and delivered margin expansion and adjusted EPS growth despite top line growth pressures.\nIn closing, I want to reiterate my gratitude to our colleagues and also thank our clients and shareholders for their support. I believe the company is well positioned to capitalize on the opportunities that lie ahead. I look forward to reinvigorating growth and to successfully executing our transformation plan. I am confident the best is yet to come as we fully look to lead and shape our industry going forward.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Andrew.\n\nAndrew Jay Krasner\n\nCFO, Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company\n\nThanks, Carl. Good morning, everyone. Thanks to all of you for joining us.\nAs expected, the fourth quarter performance faced headwinds from the delayed impact of disruptions from earlier in the year. They reflect the challenges we've previously identified and are actively working to address. To that end, we continue to push forward with our strategic goals as we finished up the year and made some early progress on our transformation efforts.\nIn the fourth quarter, we incurred restructuring charges totaling $26 million. From the actions taken in 2021, we expect to have annualized savings of $20 million, primarily from the reduction of real estate costs, the benefits of which will be recognized in 2022. The $20 million gets us 2/3 of the way towards our $30 million annualized run rate savings goal for 2022.\nFor the full year 2021, we generated profitable growth, increasing adjusted operating margin to 19.9% from 18% in the prior year. The adjusted operating margin expansion was comprised of 150 basis points of underlying growth stemming from financial discipline. This was coupled with around 100 basis points of growth from gains on book of business sales and settlements, partially offset by around 60 basis point headwind from prior divestitures and FX.\nThe expansion of our adjusted operating margin, despite top line growth pressures, highlights our dual commitments to growing profitability and focusing on cost management. As a result, we continue to expect margin improvement each year as we deliver on our 2024 margin goals.\nNow I'll turn to the overall detailed financial results. Income from operations for the fourth quarter was $687 million or 25.4% of revenue, up from the prior year fourth quarter income from operations of $579 million or 21.7% of revenue. Adjusted operating income for the fourth quarter was $868 million or 32.1% of revenue, up 170 basis points from $812 million or 30.4% of revenue in the prior year fourth quarter.\nFor the fourth quarters of 2021 and 2020, our diluted EPS from continuing operations were $4.54 and $3.62, respectively. For the fourth quarter of 2021, our adjusted EPS was up 9% to $5.67 per share as compared to $5.19 per share in the prior year fourth quarter. Further, discontinued operations represented a $14.64 loss on a diluted EPS basis for the fourth quarter of 2021 and a $0.04 on diluted EPS basis for the fourth quarter. Total diluted EPS, including both continuing and discontinued operations, increased to $19.19 for the fourth quarter 2021 compared to the prior year fourth quarter of $3.66.\nForeign currency rate changes caused a decrease in our consolidated revenue of $19 million or 1% of revenue for the quarter compared to the prior year fourth quarter with a $0.06 headwind to adjusted diluted earnings per share this quarter.\nOur U.S. GAAP tax rate for the fourth quarter was 20.8% versus 19.5% in the prior year. Our adjusted tax rate for the fourth quarter was 21.1%, up from the 17.6% rate in the prior year. The increase was due to the geographic distribution of profits.\nTurning to the balance sheet. We ended the fourth quarter with a strong capital and liquidity position with cash and cash equivalents of $4.7 billion and full capacity on our undrawn $1.5 billion revolving credit facility. WTW remains well positioned from a liquidity perspective. We continue to have significant financial flexibility which allows us to invest in transforming the company's operations to unlock growth potential while simultaneously returning capital to shareholders.\nFree cash flow, which includes discontinued operations, was $1.9 billion in the year ended 2021 compared to $1.6 billion in the prior year. The increase in year-over-year free cash flow was due to the receipt of the termination fee, net of increased transaction and integration fees of $948 million. This was partially offset by net legal settlement payments of approximately $185 million for the previously announced Stanford and Willis Towers Watson merger settlements and higher compensation and benefit payments of approximately $250 million and $383 million in tax payments primarily related to the disposal of Willis Re. Absent these items, free cash flow would have been $1.8 billion, up 15% versus the prior year.\nI want to point out that we made some changes to our statement of cash flows to reflect new guidance on restricted cash presentation in FASB ASC 230. These changes consisted of revising the classification of WTW's fiduciary fund balances on a consolidated statement of cash flows for the last 3 years. These revisions had no impact to our cash flow from operating activities or free cash flow metrics.\nIn terms of capital allocation, we paid $374 million in dividends for the year ended December 31, 2021 and repurchased 7.2 million shares for $1.6 billion. We remain committed to deploying excess capital and cash flow into share repurchases. As part of our Investor Day discussion, we communicated approximately $4 billion of near-term share repurchases and a willingness to fund further share repurchases using our free cash flow unless other investment opportunities with superior return potential arise.\nAt current price levels, we believe that repurchasing WTW stock continues to be our highest return opportunity, and we have significant resources to capitalize upon that. With $1.6 billion completed in 2021 and another $1 billion completed through today, the pace of our share repurchases highlights the conviction we have in the future of WTW and the plans we laid out at Investor Day despite the current headwinds. We expect to conclude the remainder of the roughly $4 billion of repurchases as expeditiously as practical, depending on market conditions and other factors.\nAt our Investor Day, we also announced our plans to streamline the structure of our organization by changing from 4 segments to 2 segments effective January 1, 2022. We are now operating under that new structure with just 2 segments: Risk & Broking and Health, Wealth and Career. Accordingly, going forward, our financial reports, supplemental disclosures and related commentary will reflect our new structure.\nOur 2021 financial results are a reflection of our resilience and our focus on strategic priorities. Although we have had near-term business challenges, we have undeniably strong assets which gives me confidence in our ability to continue driving value for our stakeholders. There is a lot of opportunity ahead, and we remain focused on executing our strategy and setting the path for sustainable success.\nAnd now I'll turn the call back to Carl.\n\nCarl A. Hess\n\nCEO & Director, Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company\n\nThanks, Andrew. And now we'll take your questions."

Please go ahead.\n\nCarl A. Hess\n\nHead of Investment, Risk & Reinsurance, Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company\n\nGood morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for WTW Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. Joining me today is Andrew Krasner, our Chief Financial Officer. We delivered a strong second quarter, headlined by 240 basis points of year-over-year adjusted operating margin expansion, adjusted diluting earnings per share of $2.55, a 24% increase over prior year and $361 million of free cash flow.\nThese healthy bottom line results were the product of our continued robust organic growth growing operating leverage across our businesses and the ongoing success of our transformation program. We are very pleased with our sustained momentum from the success of our strategic initiatives alongside continuing favorite market conditions. Our 6% organic revenue growth in the quarter represents the value proposition of our business, the impact of our investments in talent and technology and the markets we have prioritized.\nBased on our strong first half performance and our continued confidence in our outlook and execution, we have raised the low end of our 2024 adjusted operating margin and adjusted EPS target ranges to 23.0% to 23.5% and $16 to $17 of EPS, respectively. In addition, thanks to the success and momentum of our transformation program, we've been able to identify additional savings and accordingly, are raising our cumulative run rate transformation savings target from $425 million to $450 million by the end of 2024. We continue to expect mid-single-digit organic growth to achieve revenue of $9.9 billion plus.\nI'm pleased with our colleagues' focus and dedication in executing our strategic priorities. Our results and outlook reflect their hard work in delivering for our clients and driving improved productivity and efficiency. With that in mind, let me share some specifics on our recent progress and the opportunities ahead of us.\nAs I mentioned, our rising productivity drove greater operating leverage this quarter, significantly bolstering our bottom line performance. Our transformation efforts also contributed substantially to margin expansion. We achieved $24 million of incremental annualized savings this quarter, bringing the total to $394 million in cumulative annualized savings since the program's inception.\nAs we near the end of our 3-year transformation program, we're confident that the program has positioned us for further margin expansion over the long term. We now have the organization, processes and capabilities in place to further optimize our cost structure, increase operational effectiveness and improve profitability on an ongoing basis.\nIn HWC, we continue to harness the strength of our portfolio to drive growth. We captured demand and added new clients in each of our core businesses, made many smart connections to better serve our clients' needs across different areas and introduce new breakthrough solutions. That combination enabled us to achieve 5% organic revenue growth in the quarter, delivering accelerated growth across the Health, Wealth and Career businesses as we consciously manage BD&O growth to optimize earnings and cash flow.\nGrowth was led by our Health business, which generated 9% organic growth. Across the segment, we continue to see good levels of demand driven by health care inflation, strong employment, elevated pension fund status, new legislative and regulatory requirements and other complexities in the macro environment. Our deep expertise and rich experience, combined with our data analytics and software solutions position us well to help clients navigate the dynamic environment. from managing total rewards costs to derisking pension plans.\nOur teams have successfully generated billable upticks in a number of areas. We've added several new global benefits management appointments with organizations that want to better manage costs and also improve their employees' experience. With a favorable interest rate environment, we've helped more clients initiate pension derisking processes through both sums in the U.S. and the new e-buy-ins and buyouts in Great Britain.\nAs we've helped guide clients on the implications of new pay transparency and equity requirements to the EU, more companies have engaged us for broad-based award projects. In response to the strong employment market, we sold more compensation benchmarking surveys and more licenses to embark our employee experience portable. And our LifeSight master trust in Great Britain continues to grow, having just exceeded GBP 20 billion in assets under management.\nOur focus on smart connections across HWC has also continued to pay dividends. This past quarter, we worked with a large airline, which was already a global benefits management client of our Health business. This client sponsored a large number of pension plans in multiple countries and needed to help keeping these plans compliant competitive and well run. Our GBM team introduced the claim to our retirement team, which was able to provide a complete solution tailored to their retirement needs. Our strong existing relationship together with our smart connections mindset, helped us win a multiyear contract and gave our client a more developed service proposition with flexible pricing options.\nAnother example involves a large automotive retailer where we secured a health and benefits consulting and brokerage relationship to improve how their employees value and utilize their benefits, we introduced our employee experience team who presented a personalized digital approach to communication that helped the plan members break through the complexity of the health care environment. This generated an interest in learning how we could help them simplify the administration of their benefit plans. And after hearing how our teams could also collaborate to deliver insights to improve the plant's effectiveness and help them reduce overall health care costs they appointed us as their benefits outsourcer.\nIn a third example, our segments collaborated when a team at CRB reached out to our health and benefits [ in ] retirement experts. Our CRB team who've been helping a client assess and manage integration risks in a newly acquired business recognized that the client needs beyond property casualty risks to also include people risks requiring employee benefits expertise across multiple countries. We secured this win by offering complete M&A guidance, including strategic planning and brokerage services covering both corporate risk and employee benefits.\nWe've previously highlighted how HWC has developed breakthrough solutions that are leading the market and delighted to share 2 more breakthroughs this quarter. First, knowing how highly employees value flexibility members of our U.S. retirement team helped one of our clients find a way through complex regulations and potentially challenging administrative requirements to introduce a new pension plan feature to help employees better manage their financial situation. Also, our investments team launched our first ever dedicated private equity pools fund. The fund is innovative, semi-liquid structure and nature will be open to wealth and defined contribution plans.\nIn Risk and Broking, our focus on specialization, investments in talent and technology and top quality client service continues to sustain client retention rates in the mid-90s, and generate substantial growth opportunities. This is evidenced by the segment's organic revenue growth of 10% for the quarter, fueled by our specialty businesses, which continued to outpace the growth of the rest of the segment. All of this is the product of our differentiated service offerings and ability to adapt to our clients' changing and complex risks.\nOur R&B specialization strategy is about delivering tailored solutions that address industry-specific risks and optimizing our client outcome. One of our client wins this quarter included the insurance placement for an energy supplier who had a challenging loss record and complex risk profile and was under severe time constraints for securing an insurance solution. Thanks to our deep expertise in the natural resources sector across multiple geographies, we were able to provide the company with complete coverage in just 1 month.\nWe continue to make good progress with Verita, our open market MGU in North America. Submission volume continues to increase each month as the brand has expanded across the U.S. with broad opportunities from different brokers. The team continues to evaluate and add new products to the platform to further accelerate revenue growth in the second half of the year and beyond.\nAs we've mentioned, investments in our R&B talent base have also been a significant revenue growth driver for the segment. After a focused effort to replenish our talent base over the past few years, these new hires have become increasingly productive and are contributing to our strong organic growth in this segment. Our recent hiring efforts have been more opportunistic and strategic with the goal of enhancing our ability to achieve sustainable, profitable growth and create value.\nLucy Clark, who's recently joined us is 1 example of this type of strategic hire, Lucy's commitment to specialization, data and analytics and exceptional client service makes her a perfect fit to lead risk and broking. We expect that our market presence, proven track record and focus on talent will help further drive organic growth and margin expansion in the segment, building on the excellent work Adam Gerard has accomplished over the last 5 years.\nWe are confident that our strategic investments in talent and technology, along with our specialization strategy is leading to increased engagement with both new and existing clients. This heightened activity is crucial for driving our organic revenue growth and expanding margins for the rest of the year and beyond.\nIn conclusion, I'd like to thank our colleagues for their unwavering commitment to WTW and to our clients. which helped us to achieve another solid quarter. We continue to effectively execute on our strategic priorities, setting us up to achieve our objectives for the year. I'm enthusiastic about our opportunities in the second half of the year and have confidence that we are on the right path to achieving our goal for 2024.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Andrew.\n\nAndrew Jay Krasner\n\nCFO, Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company\n\nThanks, Carl. Good morning, and thanks for joining us today. In the second quarter, we delivered organic revenue growth of 6% and drove adjusted operating margin expansion of 240 basis points resulting in adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.55, an increase of 24% over the prior year.\nAs Carl mentioned, thanks to our solid results for the past 2 quarters and our confidence in what we expect to achieve in the second half of the year we have raised the low end of our 2024 financial targets for adjusted operating margin and adjusted EPS, bringing the target ranges to 23% to 23.5% and $16 to $17, respectively. In addition, we have been able to identify additional transformation savings and are raising our cumulative run rate target from $425 million to $450 million by the end of 2024. The total cost to achieve these savings is now estimated at $1.175 billion. These additions to the transformation program will help us drive further efficiencies as we remain focused on a strong finish to the program.\nNext, I'll spend some time reviewing our segment results. Note that to provide comparability with prior periods, all commentary regarding the results of our segments will be on an organic basis, unless specifically stated otherwise. Health, Wealth and Career generated revenue growth of 5% compared to the second quarter of last year, in line with our expectations of mid-single-digit organic revenue growth for the segment for 2024. We noted last quarter that we expected Health revenue growth to accelerate. And indeed, the business generated revenue growth of 9% for the quarter in comparison to 3% growth in Q1.\nNorth America generated strong growth as a result of increased project work. In addition, international and Europe delivered double-digit growth driven by strong client retention, new local appointments and the continued expansion of our global benefits management client portfolio.\nWealth grew 5% in the second quarter, driven by strong growth in our retirement business due to new client acquisitions and increased project work including pension derisking work in North America and additional work required in a peak valuation year in Great Britain. We also delivered solid growth in our Investments business due to improvements in capital markets and growth from our LifeSight solution.\nCareer delivered 4% revenue growth in the quarter, primarily driven by broad-based compensation assignments in working rewards in North America and Europe as well as projects related to communication work and employee experience. We also saw growth in our product revenue with more sales of Embark, our employee experience portal. Our compensation benchmarking participation continues to be elevated over 2023, which should lead to accelerated growth in the second half of 2024.\nBenefits Delivery & Outsourcing was flat for the quarter. solid growth in outsourcing from increased project work more than covered the revenue headwind related to the client we mentioned last quarter, who insourced its health and other benefits administration. This growth was offset by a decrease in our Medicare-related business, where we deliberately moderated growth to reflect market developments, maximize profitability and improve free cash flow outcomes. Said differently, we do not simply chase growth at any cost in this business. HWC's operating margin was 21.9%, an increase of 360 basis points compared to the prior year second quarter, primarily driven by operating leverage and transformation savings.\nMoving to Risk & Broking, revenue was up 10% on an organic basis for the second quarter with no meaningful impact from book of business activity. Interest income was $29 million for the quarter, up $14 million from the second quarter last year. Corporate Risk & Broking had another exceptionally strong quarter with organic growth of 11%, primarily driven by higher levels of new business, strong client retention and renewal increases across all geographies.\nOur specialty lines continue to be major contributors to the strong growth performance, led globally by our facultative, construction, crisis management and Financial Solutions teams. Growth across CRB in Europe was led by financial solutions, facultative, Fenix and crisis management. North America CRB had solid growth, driven by new business and higher renewal business from crisis management, natural resources, construction, real estate, hospitality and leisure as well as health care and life sciences. Our international region had double-digit organic growth across all subregions, led by countries in Central and Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa and Latin America.\nIn terms of rates, we see a continued improving landscape with favorable outcomes for clients. We see a stabilizing and softening market in some of our largest lines of business, such as property caused by the increasing supply of capacity from insurers. The market for financial lines continues to soften, albeit with slower rate reductions in the past quarter. An exception to that is cyber where the market is softening faster. Across those specialty lines, we see a mix, for example, in political risks and trade credit, the market is stable with some small premium rises. The same in casualty where the market remains challenged for primary risks, especially those with North America exposures.\nInsurance Consulting and Technology revenue was flat compared to prior year due to temper demand mainly in the consulting business in North America and the U.K. However, we have taken corresponding expense actions to protect our margins. we expect ICT to achieve mid-single-digit growth for the full year.\nRMB's operating margin was 20.6% for the quarter, a 450 basis point increase over the prior year second quarter primarily due to operating leverage driven by solid organic revenue growth in CRB, disciplined expense management, interest income and transformation savings.\nNow let's turn to the enterprise level results. At the enterprise level, adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 17%, a 240 basis point increase over the prior year, primarily driven by greater operating leverage and the benefits of our transformation program. We had $24 million of incremental annualized transformation savings, bringing the total to $394 million of cumulative savings since the program's inception. The program continues to better position us to drive operating leverage going forward.\nOur unallocated net was negative $106 million for the second quarter and reflects the inclusion of a $13 million provision for significant litigation. We continue to expect the full year 2024 balance to be relatively consistent with 2023. Foreign exchange was a headwind to adjusted EPS of $0.03 for the quarter. At current spot rates, we expect foreign exchange to be a headwind of approximately $0.10 on adjusted EPS for the year.\nOur U.S. GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 15.6% versus 19.8% in the prior year. Our adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 22.6% compared to 23.7% for the second quarter of 2023. We continue to expect our adjusted tax rate for the year to be close to our 2023 rate, excluding the onetime items we mentioned at year-end.\nDuring the quarter, we returned $290 million to our shareholders via share repurchases of $200 million and dividends of $90 million. We continue to view share repurchases as an attractive use of capital to create long-term shareholder value and be the central focus of balanced capital allocation. We continue to expect share repurchases to total approximately $750 million in 2024, subject to marketing conditions and other relevant factors.\nWe generated free cash flow of $361 million for the 6 months ended June 30, an increase of $11 million from prior year, primarily driven by operating margin expansion, partially offset by cash outflows related to transformation and discretionary compensation payments. The free cash flow results for the quarter are in line with our expectation as free cash flow margin was not intended to be linear for the year. We continue to be confident in our expectations of year-over-year improvement in our full year free cash flow margin.\nOur strong top line and bottom line performance this quarter reflects our ongoing momentum and the exemplary efforts of our colleagues to drive greater productivity and efficiency. We expect this to continue into the second half of the year and are confident in achieving our 2024 targets.\nWith that, let's open it up for Q&A."

Welcome to the WTW First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Please refer to wtwco.com from the press release and supplemental information that was issued earlier today. Today's call is being recorded and will be available for the next 3 months on WTW website.\nSome of the comments in today's call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed today, and the company undertakes no obligation to update these statements unless required by law.\nFor a more detailed discussion of these and other risk factors, investors should review the forward-looking statements section of the earnings press release issued this morning as well as other disclosures in the most recent Form 10-K and in other Willis Towers Watson SEC filings.\nDuring the call, certain non-GAAP financial measures may be discussed. For reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures as well as other information regarding these measures, please refer to the most recent earnings release and other materials in the Investor Relations section of the company's website.\nI'll now turn the call over to Carl Hess, WTW Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead.\n\nCarl A. Hess\n\nHead of Investment, Risk & Reinsurance, Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company\n\nGood morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for WTW's First Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. Joining me today is Andrew Krasner, our Chief Financial Officer. Our first quarter results were a great start for the year. The strong 8% organic revenue growth we delivered in the first quarter demonstrated our sustained momentum and intense focus as we continue to execute on our strategic priorities or [indiscernible] impact we're seeing from our recent investments in talented technology, which have strengthened the value we're able to provide our clients and yielded improved retention and new business growth.\nOperating leverage on this robust growth and the continued succession of our transformation program, drove 140 base operating margin expansion over the prior year, which translated into adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.84 for the quarter, an increase of 7% year-over-year.\nOverall, I'm very pleased with our Q1 results and with the excellent progress we've made since this time last year. We saw top line growth across all our businesses, reflecting the increased value of WTW solutions in complex economic environments. Amid financial sector turmoil, high inflation and ongoing geopolitical strife, we continue to see market dynamics that provide opportunities for WTW to respond to our clients' needs to improve outcomes and reduce risk.\nNow I'd like to share some additional perspective on the reset of our near and long-term expectations for free cash flow announced this morning. Our previous target for 3-year cumulative free cash flow through 2024 reflected our goal of substantially improving our free cash flow margin. This being in addition to achieving our revenue and margin targets.\nWe have made timely and meaningful progress toward our goals for revenue and adjusted operating margins, and we continue to believe that our long-term free cash flow improvement opportunities remain substantial and achievable. These opportunities include optimizing structural and contractual aspects of our business, enhancing our system and processes and streamlining our working capital.\nHowever, we now believe that the best and most sustainable path to realizing those opportunities will take us beyond the end of 2024. As a result, over the near term, we expect free cash flow as a percentage of revenue to improve significantly from 2022's base of 8% free cash flow margin. Over the longer term, we still anticipate growth towards peers free cash flow margins as the benefits from our improvement actions gain more traction and begin to drive a shorter conversion cycle.\nI want to make it very, very clear that we remain committed to delivering on our core operating results. Our achievements on those fronts so far, including our very solid start to 2023, give us confidence that we will be successful in delivering on those goals.\nBefore turning it over to Andrew, I also want to update you on our Growth, Simplify and Transform initiatives. Our growth initiatives take advantage of the opportunities in both core and fast-growing markets using our analytics capabilities and specialist knowledge to help create a more valuable and differentiated client experience. In Risk and Broking, our specialized approach, coupled with the strategic hires we've made over the past year have driven accelerated growth. In health, wealth and Korea, we've had success cross-selling new solutions and products alongside our core advisory work.\nOur focus on specialization has driven us to find improvements to existing solutions, new product innovation and most recently, identification and successful execution on opportunities for strategic collaboration. For example, we just announced a partnership with Zurich involving digital trading within our broking platform, which leverages data to structure risk to allow for a more competitive placement experience.\nAnother example of our strategic partnerships is our new relations with Sapiens, a leading global provider of software for the insurance industry. We have partnered with Sapiens to create integrated solutions to help insurers underwrite policies more efficiently. These are both great examples of how our innovations are driving growth by streamlining the very complex business of risk management and modernizing traditional broking while giving our customers a quicker and more efficient experience.\nA third example is our partnership with Transamerica to oversee administration and recordkeeping for our recently launched LifeSight pooled employer plan in the U.S. This new product will allow employers to offer a market-leading defined contribution plan and employee experience with limited demand on their internal resources.\nShifting to our Simplify initiatives, we believe our improved sales and retention outcomes have resulted in part from our efforts to streamline the back-end shared operations. This has enabled us to deploy a more cohesive and consistent global model that leverages our scale and provides a smoother client experience from prospect to renewal.\nFinally, our transformation program delivered $75 million of incremental annualized savings during the first quarter, consistent with the expected pacing of the $100 million in incremental run rate savings we expect to generate from the program this year. This brings the total to $224 million in cumulative annualized savings since the program's inception. We continue to search for additional opportunities for savings.\nOverall, we believe we're making progress toward our long-term organic growth, margin expansion and EPS targets. Continued execution of our strategic initiatives this quarter delivered healthy organic revenue growth strong adjusted operating margin expansion and further savings from our transformation program.\nIn closing, I want to thank our colleagues for their performance this quarter and even dedication. We are truly appreciative of their continued commitment to our vision and the relentless focus on our strategic priorities to grow, simplify and transform.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Andrew.\n\nAndrew Jay Krasner\n\nCFO, Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company\n\nThanks, Karl. Good morning, everyone. Thanks to all of you for joining us today. Our clients continue to face a host of economic challenges, including rising commercial insurance rates. However, pricing increases appear to be moderating as our fourth quarter 2022 commercial lines insurance pricing survey showed an aggregate increase of just below 5%.\nData for nearly all lines continue to indicate price increases with the exception of workers' compensation and directors and officers liability. The largest price increases came in commercial auto, followed by commercial property. We continue to focus on helping our clients with our specialized knowledge and risk and broking capabilities so they can make more informed decisions about how to best manage their risk in the current environment.\nAs Carl mentioned, we had a strong start to the year with first quarter revenue up 8% on an organic basis and solid growth across our portfolio of businesses. Our adjusted operating margin was 18.6%, a 140 basis point improvement over prior year, reflecting our growth and expense discipline, along with the benefits of our transformation program. The net result was adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.84, a 7% increase over the prior year.\nLet's turn to our detailed segment results. Note that to provide comparability with prior periods, all commentary regarding the results of our segments will be on an organic basis, unless specifically stated otherwise. The health, wealth and career segment generated revenue growth of 6% on both an organic and constant currency basis compared to the first quarter of last year.\nRevenue for health increased 8% for the quarter primarily due to increased project work in North America related to helping clients implement legislative changes and managed plan costs as well as from strong growth in international with new client appointments supplemented by health care inflation and increases in client covered populations.\nWell, grew 4% in the first quarter. The growth was primarily attributable to higher levels of retirement work in Europe and North America, including compliance and derisking projects along with new client acquisitions. This growth was partially offset by a nominal decrease in our Investments business, which continued to be pressured by the decline in capital markets that occurred in the second half of 2022.\nCareer experienced 4% growth in the quarter, driven by increased demand for advisory services and increases in data and software license sales. Benefits, delivery and outsourcing generated 7% growth in the quarter. The increase was driven by new outsourcing clients and compliance projects plus strength in our individual marketplace with growth from higher volumes and placements of Medicare Advantage and life policies.\nHWC's operating margin was 24% this quarter compared to 20.7% in the same prior year period. This strong margin growth was primarily due to higher operating leverage. Risk and Broking revenue was up 10% on an organic basis and 5% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year first quarter.\nCorporate Risk and Broking had an outstanding quarter with an organic revenue increase of 10% and driven by growth across all regions and most lines of business, primarily from new business and improved retention. As we've indicated, book of business settlement activity has slowed after the uptick over the last 2 years with only a 1 percentage point impact on organic growth for the quarter.\nInvestment income was $12 million for the quarter due to higher rates and impacted organic growth for the quarter by 1 percentage point. North America had a strong quarter due to new and renewal business and increased retention, a result of the strategic investments and initiatives that Carl highlighted earlier.\nEurope also had solid new business performance across a number of product lines including aerospace, financial solutions and natural resources as our focus on building and strengthening our industry and product specializations continues to deliver robust growth. International also contributed to organic growth with double-digit growth in all regions.\nIn the Insurance, Consulting and Technology business, revenue was up 7% over the prior year period, primarily driven by increased sales and retention in Technology Solutions. R&B operating margin was 19.9% for the first quarter compared to 21.6% in the prior year first quarter. Margin headwinds reflect the inclusion of profits up until the date of deconsolidation from our now divested Russia business in the comparable period.\nAbsent this headwind, margins improved as a result of organic revenue growth in CRB and transformation savings, gain on sale and interest income, partially offset by the run rate impact of 2022 strategic investment hires. As we expected, last year's key hires have begun to contribute to our performance in a meaningful way as exemplified by the solid organic growth this quarter, and we continue to expect a ramp-up in production this year.\nNow let's turn to the enterprise level results. We generated profitable growth this quarter with our adjusted operating margin increasing 140 basis points to 18.6% from 17.2% in the prior year. This improvement reflects the benefits of higher operating leverage from the increased top line growth and transformation-related savings, which we expect to continue to be a key contributor to our ongoing margin expansion and the attainment of our 2024 margin goals.\nPlease note that the margin tailwind created by interest income and book of business settlement activity was offset by the margin headwind from the divestiture of our highly profitable Russia business, whose results were included in the prior year up until the date of deconsolidation.\nForeign currency was a headwind on adjusted EPS of $0.06 for the first quarter, largely due to the strength of the U.S. dollar. Assuming today's rates continue for the remainder of the year, we expect a foreign currency headwind on adjusted earnings per share of $0.05. Our U.S. GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 19.5% versus 27.5% in the prior year.\nOur adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 20.5% compared to 21.1% in the prior year. The current quarter adjusted tax rate is lower primarily due to the favorable impact of discrete items in the current year. The adjusted tax rate for the full year may increase moderately as a result of the U.K. corporate tax rate increase which became effective on April 1.\nOur strong balance sheet gives us continued confidence in our ability to execute a disciplined capital allocation strategy that balances capital return to shareholders with internal investments in strategic M&A to deploy our capital in the highest return opportunities.\nDuring the quarter, we paid $87 million in dividends and repurchased approximately 432,000 shares for $104 million. We continue to view share repurchases as an attractive use of capital. We generated free cash flow of $92 million for the first quarter of 2023 compared to free cash flow of negative $10 million in the prior year.\nThe $102 million year-over-year improvement in free cash flow was primarily driven by more favorable working capital improvements resulting mostly from higher cash collections and lower discretionary compensation payments made in the current year quarter as compared to the prior year quarter.\nOur Q1 results are reflective of the progress we've made since the beginning of 2022. We've come a long way stabilizing the business, rebuilding our talent base, strengthening our organic revenue growth and accelerating the transformation program to drive greater profitability in the future. We're committed to delivering the same success with free cash flow generation.\nThough our actual cash flow have not yet yielded results within the time frame we expected, we remain focused in the near term on driving meaningful improvement in our free cash flow margin for 2022's base of 8% free cash flow margin, and in the longer term, making continual progress and moving more towards peer levels.\nAs free cash flow generation remains a high priority, we've made enhancements to our original improvement plans to strengthen our organizational focus on cash flow. As you may have seen in our proxy statement, we have added free cash flow as a KPI for annual incentives in the executive compensation program and are working on implementing cash flow-linked KPIs for others in the organization to drive broader accountability across the company.\nIn addition, we are focused on pursuing long-term structural and contractual improvements to the cash aspects of how our businesses operate. As you might expect, this is the area where we have the largest class of opportunity to improve, but those opportunities are the most time consuming to realize.\nAs a reminder, full year 2023 pension income is expected to be about $112 million. If this level of pension income remains consistent in 2024, it would pose a significant headwind to our 2024 adjusted EPS target. Pension income, which is sensitive to macroeconomic conditions is remeasured at year-end. Accordingly, we will provide additional guidance on our 2024 pension income expectations and the resulting impact to the adjusted EPS target when we release Q4 2023 earnings results.\nOverall, we are excited by the strong start to 2023 with business performance ramping up as expected, and the benefits of our investments in talent and technology starting to meaningfully contribute to results. In addition, our successful transformation efforts and operating leverage have allowed us to continue to drive margin expansion. We have made consistent progress in our commitments for organic revenue growth and increased operating margins and EPS.\nWith that, let's open it up for Q&A."

Please go ahead.\n\nCarl A. Hess\n\nHead of Investment, Risk & Reinsurance, Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company\n\nGood morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for WTW's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. Joining me today is Andrew Krasner, our Chief Financial Officer.\nWe had a solid start to the year, delivering first quarter results in line with our expectations. Our momentum from last year has carried us into 2024 as we continue to execute on our strategic priorities to grow, simplify and transform. Our exceptional solutions, productivity from new hires and investments in talent and technology continue to play a pivotal role in fueling organic revenue growth of 5%. Simultaneously, our transformation initiatives helped us generate adjusted operating margin expansion of 200 basis points year-over-year and 16% growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share.\nWe had $33 million of incremental annualized savings from our transformation program during the first quarter, bringing the total to $370 million in cumulative annualized savings since the program's inception. We continue to look for more opportunities to optimize the business while leveraging our cost structure to expand our margins. This encouraging start to the year, our robust new business pipeline and our plans for realizing operating efficiencies across the rest of the year, give us a high level of confidence that we will deliver on our 2024 commitments.\nI'm pleased with how our strategic progress has driven this quarter's results and more importantly, has positioned us for continued profitable growth. For the first quarter of 2024, we delivered top line growth, underscoring the heightened importance of our services in the current market. Our distinctive data-driven and industry-specific approach is making us more attuned to specific economic dynamics that allow us to enhance outcomes and mitigate risk for our clients.\nOur global client model continues to resonate with the market, thanks to our world-class offerings and the unwavering dedication of our colleagues. All this puts us in a strong position to achieve sustainable profitable growth and to enhance long-term shareholder value.\nLet me give you an update on the progress we've made and the opportunities ahead for our segments. Our specialization strategy in Risk and Broking remains a key growth driver for both the segment and the company. R&B had organic revenue growth of 8% for the quarter. Our Specialty businesses continue to strongly outpace the rest of the segment's growth. And we also continue to see sustained client retention rates in the mid-90s, the product of the ongoing value of our data and analytics focus and the effective insurance solutions that we provide to our clients.\nWe often get questions about WTW's specialist approach and how it sets us apart. What's unique about WTW's approach is that our entire business, not just the client-facing parts is structured around industry concentrations. This has clear benefits for both our clients and our operations. Clients can tap into both our global and local expertise, which includes unique data and analytical tools that help create a continuous cycle as we tackle industry challenges, aggregate our experience and information and use that to further improve our solutions to meet specific industry needs.\nFrom an operational point of view, these are businesses with national or even global P&Ls and not simply an industry practice group. Our dedicated industry teams have heightened accountability for end-to-end performance and make informed decisions based on their experience and in-depth knowledge that results in exceptional value delivered to our clients while achieving strong financial results.\nA client win from this past quarter illustrates the effectiveness of this approach. Members of our global construction line of business based in our Europe and international geographies came together to win a multiyear contract for a rail infrastructure leader, by creating a custom solution that fit the client's unique risk management profile. The global teams were assisted by our local teams in the country where the railway was being built, enabling us to provide even further specific expertise to the situation. Our team's familiarity with the industry-specific risks associated with rail infrastructure, combined with our specialized geographic knowledge ultimately secured us to win amidst fierce competition.\nIn North America, our transition to industry-focused divisions is complete, enhancing our ability to meet client needs and driving innovation and new offerings through our industry verticals. One example of this is Verita, our open market MGU, which has continued to exceed our expectations since its introduction last quarter. The recent addition of workers' compensation capabilities further solidifies Verita's proposition within the insurance ecosystem, enhancing its value proposition and is expanding its market reach. We continue to expect the investments made in talented technology over the last few years, combined with the reorientation of the R&B business towards specialization will drive higher levels of activity with new and existing clients that is fundamental to our organic revenue growth and margin expansion trajectory this year.\nIn HWC, we remain focused on our core businesses, while fostering smart connections to fuel sustainable organic growth of 4% in the quarter. Clients continue to recognize that the deep expertise we have at each of our HWC businesses enables us to deliver market-leading solutions across our Health, Wealth, Career and Benefits Delivery & Outsourcing businesses and make breakthroughs that matter in a complex and changing environment.\nFor example, with many pension plans being well funded, our retirement teams around the world have helped clients derisk their plans and gain access to surplus assets not only through traditional means like annuity buy-ins and buyouts but also through novel approaches like reopening previously closed pension plans. In addition, we've assembled a unique solution involving bulk annuity purchases at our retiree health care exchange that enables U.S. organizations to derisk retiree medical obligations. After launching this solution late last year, we've already helped clients settle some $430 million in retiree medical liabilities, and we expect another $500 million in settlements over the rest of this year.\nIn other breakthroughs, we're using artificial intelligence and broader digital tools to help clients answer some big questions about their people processes. Specifically, we've doubled our digitally enabled revenue into the career area, 2 years running, and are focused on doubling again in 2024. This includes us helping dozens of the world's largest companies identify the skills their employees need to deliver solid business results and grow in their careers.\nWe've also developed thousands of job profiles and aligned hundreds of jobs to specific career levels with AI, freeing up time for consultants so that they can spend more of their time advising clients and reward strategy and program design. Our digital solutions extended to the executive pay area with our proprietary performance modeling tool that we've deployed to help hundreds of compensation committees make decisions about executive pay and performance targets.\nStepping over to healthcare, we see no shortage of opportunities. There's continued high inflation around the world and the introduction of new Specialty solutions is not abating. Clients and prospects are looking for breakthrough to deliver value and impact, evidenced by the more than 2,500 people who recently attended our Flagship U.S. Healthcare Conference.\nAll of our core businesses are helping organizations respond to new legislation and regulation from the Netherlands Pension Legislation to the EU Pay Transparency Requirements. An important part of core business growth in HWC is the smart connections that span the segment, which create opportunities to cultivate sustainable sticky relationships. Two examples of this came with wins this past quarter with a telecommunications provider and a global biopharmaceutical company.\nIn both instances, we were able to create a comprehensive bundle of solutions by engaging our teams across working rewards, employee experience, retirement and Benefits Delivery & Administration. In addition to being simply larger, these multi-business relationships are typically more embedded and more profitable as we build connections with varied client stakeholders, deliver greater value, utilize our client knowledge and leverage common resources.\nOur focus on smart connections continues to gain traction across our segments, demonstrating the complementary nature of our businesses and providing further evidence of the value of our multi-industry expertise. For example, this past quarter, our colleagues in HWC help tee up a broking opportunity for our CRB team to do a complete review of a health and benefit clients P&C insurance strategy and programs. After detailing our approach to industry specialization, our CRB colleagues were chosen for all lines of coverage over the incumbent.\nPutting it all together, good market demand, well-positioned core businesses, breakthrough solutions in new areas and smart connections that add value, the outlook for HWC remains strong. In closing, I'm proud of our performance this quarter, which reflects our continued strategic progress. We're executing successfully at our priorities and as a result, we're in a solid position to deliver on our goals for 2024. I'm excited about the opportunities that lie ahead for the rest of the year and beyond. And as always, I extend my gratitude to our colleagues for continuing to stay dedicated and committed to WTW and our clients.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Andrew.\n\nAndrew Krasner\n\nThanks, Carl. Good morning, and thanks for joining us today. As Carl mentioned, we started the year on a strong note, achieving results that were in line with our expectations and position us well to achieve our 2024 targets. We remain focused on driving profitable growth through improving productivity leveraging our specialization and smart connection strategies and executing our transformation program. In the quarter, we delivered organic revenue growth of 5% and drove adjusted operating margin expansion of 200 basis points. The result was adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.29, an increase of 16% over prior year.\nNext, I'll spend some time reviewing our segment results. Note that to provide comparability with prior periods, all commentary regarding the results of our segments will be on an organic basis, unless specifically stated otherwise. Health, Wealth and Career generated revenue growth of 4% compared to the first quarter of last year, in line with our expectations of mid-single-digit organic revenue growth for the segment in 2024.\nHealth revenue increased 3% for the quarter, led by high-single-digit growth in international and Europe and driven by the continued expansion of our global benefits management client portfolio. Timing of new business contributed to lower growth in North America, where our business is typically fee-based. We expect that to accelerate significantly throughout the remainder of the year, in line with high-single-digit growth expectations for the full year.\nWealth grew 3% in the first quarter, driven by strong growth in our retirement business due to increased pension derisking work in North America and Europe, along with a modest increase in our Investments business due in part to new products. Career delivered 3% growth in the quarter, primarily driven by increased projects related to communication work and employee experience and more broad-based reward assignments and working reward. It is notable that in this point in the year, our compensation benchmarking participation is up double digits over 2023, creating a pipeline for accelerated growth in the latter half of 2024.\nBenefits Delivery & Outsourcing generated 6% growth in the quarter. The increase was driven by higher volumes and placements of Medicare Advantage and life policies in our individual marketplace business. Based on the incidence of growth projected by carriers in the Medicare Advantage space, we expect more moderated growth later in the year. Offsetting the BDA growth was low growth in our outsourcing business as we absorbed a revenue headwind due to a large client in-sourcing its health and other benefits administration.\nHWC's operating margin was 25.1%, an increase of 110 basis points compared to the prior year first quarter, primarily driven by transformation savings. Risk and Broking revenue was up 8% on an organic basis for the first quarter. There was a $5 million unfavorable year-over-year impact from book of business activity. Interest income was $28 million for the quarter, up $16 million from the first quarter last year.\nCorporate Risk & Broking had another strong quarter, growing 9% or 10% excluding the impact of book-of-business activity primarily driven by strong client retention across all geographies and higher level of new business activity. Our specialty lines continue to be a major contributor to the strong growth performance led globally by financial solutions and natural resources. Growth across CRB in Europe was led by Financial Solutions, Aerospace, Natural Resources, Marine and P&C.\nNorth America CRB had solid growth driven by new business across several lines, including Construction, Natural Resources and Real Estate, Hospitality and Leisure as well as contributions from our new Verita business. Our international region also contributed strong organic growth across all subregions, led by countries in Central and Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa.\nLooking at the insurance industry more broadly in terms of rates, the market remains a bit mixed with some flattening and even softening in specific insurance lines such as D&O and cyber. However, the current risk environment is marked by increased frequency in natural disasters, social inflation and geopolitical conflicts. And as a result of that, we see rate increases across various lines such as casualty, especially in North America, and globally in political violence and terrorism.\nInsurance Consulting & Technology revenue was flat with prior year due to the timing of consulting and technology revenue between quarters. We expect ICT to achieve mid- to high-single-digit growth for the full year and in line with our overall expectations for Risk and Broking. R&B's operating margin was 20.8% for the quarter, a 90-basis-point increase over the prior year first quarter, primarily due to interest income, transformation savings and solid organic revenue growth in CRB. R&B also faced margin headwinds this quarter from the impact of book of business activity as well as foreign exchange.\nIn addition, as we mentioned at year-end, now that our talent base in R&B is back to full strength, we are focused on strategic and opportunistic talent investments with industry expertise as well as investments in technology that will eventually yield more revenue than what is currently in the mix. These investments impacted R&B's margins this quarter. However, they will enhance our presence and capabilities in the lines of business and geographies that we believe offer the greatest growth and profitability potential.\nWe continue to expect margin expansion on a full year basis and as we mentioned last quarter, given the business' seasonality and uncertain pacing of our investments, the scale of R&B margin expansion may vary from quarter-to-quarter, but should improve over the course of the year.\nNow let's turn to the enterprise level results. At the enterprise level, adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 20.6%, a 200-basis-point increase over prior year. The benefits of our transformation program drove a large part of our margin expansion for the quarter alongside improved operating leverage. We had $33 million of incremental annualized transformation savings for the quarter, bringing the total to $370 million since the program's inception. The benefits this program provides will better position us to drive sustainable operating leverage going forward.\nOur unallocated net was negative $56 million for the first quarter. We continue to expect the full year 2024 balance to be relatively consistent with 2023. Foreign exchange did not have a meaningful impact on adjusted EPS for the quarter, at current spot rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a headwind of approximately $0.05 on adjusted EPS for the year. Our U.S. GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 19.9% versus 19.5% in the prior year. Our adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 22.4% compared to 20.5% for the first quarter of 2023. We continue to expect our adjusted tax rate for the year to be close to our 2023 rate, excluding the onetime tax items we mentioned last quarter.\nDuring the quarter, we returned $187 million to our shareholders with share repurchases of $101 million and dividends of $86 million. We continue to execute a disciplined capital allocation strategy and currently view share repurchases as an attractive use of capital to create long-term shareholder value. We continue to expect approximately $750 million of share repurchases in 2024, subject to market conditions and other relevant factors.\nOur interest expense for the quarter was $64 million versus $54 million in the first quarter of 2023. We actively managed our leverage profile by issuing $750 million of new debt in March. A portion of those proceeds will be used to pay our upcoming $650 million debt maturity in June.\nWe generated free cash flow of negative $9 million for the first quarter, a decline of $101 million from the prior year, primarily driven by increased cash outflows related to transformation and discretionary compensation payments partially offset by higher inflows from collections. The free cash flow results for the quarter are in line with what we planned as free cash flow margin was not intended to be a linear path for the year. We continue to be confident in our expectations of year-over-year improvement in our full year free cash flow margin.\nOur results this quarter were a solid start to 2024, and reflect a continuation of the significant progress we have been making on our strategy and operational performance. We expect our momentum to continue throughout the rest of the year and are confident in achieving our 2024 targets.\nWith that, let's open it up for Q&A."

Please go ahead.\n\nCarl A. Hess\n\nCEO & Director, Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company\n\nGood morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for WTW's Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. Joining me today is Andrew Krasner, our Chief Financial Officer. In 2022, we focused on executing against our growth, simplify and transform strategic priorities, continuing to bring the best of WTW to our clients and generating value for our shareholders. I'm proud to say that we delivered on all of these commitments. Today, we are stronger, more resilient and better positioned than we were a year ago, and I'm excited about what we will achieve going forward.\nOur fourth quarter performance reflects the momentum we've been building and is a solid finish to a great year. In Q4, we delivered 5% organic growth which brought our full year organic growth to 4%, in line with the mid-single-digit forecast for 2022. We also saw a modest margin expansion, despite significant headwinds from prior year book of business settlement activity, which is expected to normalize going forward. We generated adjusted diluted earnings per share of $6.33, up 12% over the prior year fourth quarter. We also continued to execute against our capital allocation strategy completing another $440 million in share repurchases in the fourth quarter, bringing our full year total to $3.5 billion.\nOur transformation efforts continue to have a significant impact. During the fourth quarter, we realized $49 million of incremental annualized savings. This brings the total to $149 million in cumulative annualized savings since the program's inception and positions us well to achieve our 2024 target of $360 million. In advancing our simplified goals, we further refined our organizational structure by consolidating our Asia and Australasia operations into one Asia Pacific region. This streamlined unit will be better able to leverage shared resources and to seamlessly serve clients in the region. Simon Weaver, who is previously the head of AustralAsia will lead the new integrated region and be responsible for driving growth through closer collaboration across the business.\nFor our grow initiatives, we remain focused on driving better outcomes for our clients through our innovative and differentiated offerings. Most recently, we launched a customized online platform for the aviation sector which gives our clients access to WTW's expertise across the globe, 24/7. Tailored to the unique challenges and needs of the sector, this platform allows airline and aviation-related clients to share technical expertise, news and insights, strengthening the breadth and depth of our client and industry relationships. We also advanced our grow initiatives with the recent introduction of WTW's collaboration with Liberty Specialty Markets and Markel. Together, we launched the pilot phase of an innotive digital commercial insurance platform. This is a significant step forward in our broader strategy to transform our digital capabilities across the entire value chain. The venture will improve connectivity, giving brokers efficient, flexible trading options.\nElsewhere within Risk and Broking, the ongoing rollout of our industry specialization strategy in CRB is producing great results with our global lines of business driving high single-digit organic growth. We're also excited by the traction our growing initiatives have gained within Health wealth and Career. Our focus on making connections across our businesses produced meaningful benefits in the fourth quarter with a noteworthy portion of our discretionary project sales referred by other businesses.\nIn 2022, we made significant investments in rebuilding our talent base. WTW hired over 9,700 colleagues last year, demonstrating the appeal of WTW as a destination for talent. Our investment has translated into revenue growth in 2022, and we expect this to continue throughout 2023. We also saw the benefit of our retention efforts with voluntary attrition remaining in line with macro trends. As a result, WTW finished the year with 46,600 colleagues around the globe, an increase that has restored our headcount to 2019 levels despite the divestitures made since that time.\nOverall, I'm pleased with our fourth quarter performance. The progress we have made to date, executing our strategic priorities to grow, simplify and transform gives us confidence that WTW is on the right path to drive sustainable growth and value creation.\nIn the year ahead, we're focused on further accelerating our growth, driving greater operating leverage and prioritizing cash generation. The current complex economic environment supports our ambitions. Our clients are facing many uncertainties, including inflation, rising interest rates, softer GDP growth, a tight labor market, ESG risk and potential recession. The regulatory focus on pensions in an uncertain economic environment is also heightened. As we've seen historically, such volatility can create strong demand for specialist work and products that our unique combination of businesses provide. I'm pleased with our ability to help clients evaluate their risks and opportunities in these complex environments.\nFor example, recent market dynamics have provided defined benefit plan sponsors for the increased funding levels, which in turn has created flexibility to explore a range of potential alternatives including modifications to investment strategies as well as pension risk transfer options. We've seen a significant increase in pension risk transfer projects, many of which evolved over multiple years and require a high degree of specialization. In addition, we're seeing increased interest in clients reviewing their nonqualified benefits as well as investigating programs to manage their workforces, additional areas in which we are ideally placed to help.\nMany of our clients also continue to navigate sustained rising commercial insurance rates. Across various lines, insurers are pushing for premium increases. This causes even greater challenges for our clients as they try to manage complex risks. We're well positioned to help clients through this difficult rate environment. Our customized tools ensure that clients get the best return for their premium dollar across their entire portfolio of risks. We call this Connected Risk Intelligence and believe it represents the future of financially efficient insurance buying. At the same time, we continue to build momentum.\nOur recent hires are becoming more productive. We're getting faster, more agile and better connected and our transformation program is delivering. We see continued demand from clients seeking our solutions to manage their unique challenges, which strengthens our conviction in achieving mid-single-digit organic revenue growth in 2023. We expect to deliver another year of operating margin expansion led by an incremental $100 million in annualized transformation program cost savings and improved free cash flow. Andrew will share more details on our outlook for the year, but in short, we're driving hard to achieve our long-term targets.\nIn closing, our performance in 2022 demonstrated our focus on delivering on our commitments and our pursuit of profitable, sustainable growth. We believe that robust client demand in the face of a complex risk environment and the successful execution of our strategy will continue to drive momentum and we remain focused on achieving our goals and creating shareholder value.\nLast, but certainly not least, I want to thank our colleagues for their performance this year. I sincerely appreciate their dedication, service and continued commitment to our clients. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Andrew.\n\nAndrew Jay Krasner\n\nCFO, Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company\n\nThanks, Carl. Good morning, everyone. Thanks to all of you for joining us today. As Carl mentioned, we finished the year on a high note and our outlook for 2023 is positive. Now I'd like to share some further details on our financial results.\nThe fourth quarter was in line with our expectations, with revenue up 5% on an organic basis. For the year, organic revenue growth was 4%, and we had solid growth across our portfolio of businesses. For the quarter, adjusted diluted earnings per share were $6.33, an increase of 12% over the prior year. For the year, adjusted diluted earnings per share were $13.41, representing 16% growth over the prior year.\nNow on to our detailed segment results. Note that to provide comparability with prior periods, all commentary regarding the results of our segments will be on an organic basis, unless specifically stated otherwise. The health, wealth and career or HWC segment generated revenue growth of 5% on an organic and constant currency basis compared to the fourth quarter of last year. Excluding the year-over-year headwind from book of business settlement activity, HWC's organic revenue grew 6%.\nRevenue for health was flat for the fourth quarter primarily due to a strong comparative arising from book gains in the prior year. Excluding this activity, health revenue grew 6%, primarily driven by portfolio growth and new client appointments in Europe and international as well as increased project work in North America related to helping clients manage increasing costs and implementing legislative changes.\nWealth grew 5% in the fourth quarter. The growth was primarily attributable to higher levels of project work actuarial valuation activity and new administration clients in North America and a combination of regulatory and settlement work in Great Britain. This growth was partially offset by a nominal decrease in our Investments business, which was pressured by declines in capital markets, an expected headwind we mentioned during our third quarter earnings call. The Wealth business finished the year with a strong fourth quarter, offsetting declines experienced earlier in 2022.\nCareer experienced 9% growth in the fourth quarter. This growth was largely driven by strong client demand for talent and compensation products, including compensation benchmarking surveys and advisory work, as well as employee engagement offerings, which we expect to continue this year. Benefits Delivery and Outsourcing generated 6% revenue growth in the fourth quarter. The increase was largely driven by individual marketplace, with strong growth from higher volumes and placements in Medicare Advantage policies. As expected, TRANZACT delivered double-digit growth in its seasonally strongest quarter and for the full year. Driven by a supportive macro environment and our focus on profitably growing the business.\nTechnology and Administrative Solutions revenue also increased primarily due to new client appointments and increased project activity. We continue to see growth opportunities for these businesses and expect that they will continue their growth trajectory into 2023. HWC's operating margin was 39% for the third quarter compared to 38.2% in the prior year fourth quarter. Excluding the impact of book of business activity, HWC's operating margin was 39% compared to 37.6% in the prior year fourth quarter.\nFor the full year, HWC's operating margin was 26.1% compared to 25.6% in the prior year. The 50 basis point improvement was due to improved operating leverage and transformation-related savings. Risk and Broking revenue was up 5% on an organic basis and 3% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year fourth quarter. Excluding the headwind from book of business settlement activity, R&D's organic revenue increased 6%. Corporate Risk & Broking or CRB, organic revenue increased 3%. Excluding book of business settlement activity, CRB's organic revenue growth was 5%. The business generated growth across all regions, driven by new business wins in construction, natural resources and aerospace. Excluding headwinds from prior year book of business settlements, North America revenue increased with notable growth in construction. Europe and international also made strong contributions to CRB's growth with new business in construction and aerospace.\nIn the Insurance Consulting and Technology business, revenue was up 17% over the prior year fourth quarter, benefiting from the timing of software sales, which had originally been expected earlier in the year as well as increased advisory work. For the year, ICT delivered strong growth of 9%, in line with our long-term expectations for this business. R&D's operating margin was 28.3% for the quarter compared to 30.1% in the prior year fourth quarter. Excluding the impact of book of business activity, RMB's operating margin was 27.6% for the quarter compared to 28.3% in the prior year fourth quarter. For the full year, RMB's operating margin was 21.2% compared to 23.4% in the prior year. The decline in margin was due to our significant investments in talent. We expect these investments to continue to gain momentum in 2023 as the contributions of these hires become more meaningful.\nNow let's turn to the enterprise level results. Adjusted operating income was $882 million for the quarter with 32% of revenue, a 20 basis point improvement over the prior year. For the year, adjusted operating margin was 20.9%, a 100 basis point improvement over the prior year. Our improved adjusted operating margins primarily reflect the benefits of strategic portfolio management which were realized at the corporate level, alongside transformation program savings, which were realized at the segment level, but in some of our businesses were more than offset by our increased investments in talent during the period.\nAs Carl mentioned, during the fourth quarter, we realized $49 million of incremental annualized savings. Transformation savings will continue to be a key aspect of our ongoing margin expansion efforts as we're encouraged by the results this year, which exceeded both our original $30 million target for 2022 and our most recent forecast of $110 million for the year. To date, our transformation savings have outpaced our original expectations from a timing perspective, driven primarily by accelerated workforce savings, technology savings from migrating operations to the cloud and reductions in our overall real estate footprint.\nFor 2023, we expect our transformation program to deliver approximately $100 million in incremental run rate savings by the end of the year with continued contributions from real estate, technology and process optimization. Foreign currency was a headwind on adjusted EPS of $0.25 for the year, largely due to the strength of the U.S. dollar. Assuming exchange rates remain at current levels, we expect foreign currency to be a $0.06 headwind in Q1 of 2023, but only a $0.01 headwind for the full year. We generated free cash flow of $674 million for 2022 compared to free cash flow of $1.9 billion in 2021. This decrease was primarily due to the receipt of the $1 billion termination fee in the comparable period and the absence of cash generation from the divested treaty reinsurance business.\nLooking ahead, growing earnings and generating healthy free cash flow remain our priorities. Our U.S. GAAP tax rate for the fourth quarter was 17.7% versus 20.8% in the prior year. Our adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 22.2% versus 21.1% in the prior year, with the difference primarily due to the geographic distribution of profits. For the year, our U.S. GAAP tax rate was 15.4% versus 19.9% in the prior year. Our adjusted tax rate for the full year was 20.9%, more in line with the 20.7% rate in the prior year.\nIn 2022, we returned a significant amount of capital to our shareholders, paying $369 million in dividends and repurchasing 15.7 million shares for $3.5 billion. We will continue to pursue a disciplined capital allocation strategy that balances capital return with internal investments and strategic M&A to deploy our capital in the highest return opportunities. While we expect share repurchases to remain the primary avenue for capital deployment, we continue to evaluate all our options to create value for shareholders.\nTurning to our 2023 guidance. Based on current market conditions, we expect to deliver mid-single-digit organic revenue growth alongside adjusted operating margin expansion despite continued investments in long-term growth. We also expect an improvement in free cash flow now that onetime cash outflows primarily related to our divested treaty reinsurance business are behind us. As I mentioned earlier, we expect to see $100 million in incremental annualized transformation program savings. With respect to noncash pension income, we expect to see a decline due to market volatility and interest rate movements.\nFor 2023, we expect about $112 million in pension income as compared to $271 million in 2022. I'd like to note that despite this dynamic, the funded position of our plans has improved. We remain focused on our long-term targets and recognize that to achieve them, we will need to build on prior momentum and continue to accelerate revenue, margin and cash flow growth. Each of these areas remains the subject of significant management attention.\nOverall, it was a strong quarter and year for WTW with performance that aligned with our expectations. Our results reflect a lot of hard work, which included vigorous hiring efforts, investments in technology, successful transformation initiatives and the unwavering dedication of our colleagues. We ended the year in a solid position, and I'm confident that we will continue to build momentum in 2023 as we work to achieve our long-term targets.\nWith that, let's open it up for Q&A."

Please go ahead.\n\nCarl A. Hess\n\nHead of Investment, Risk & Reinsurance, Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company\n\nGood morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for WTW's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. Joining me today is Andrew Krasner, our Chief Financial Officer. We had a strong third quarter, delivering 9% organic revenue growth and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.24, maintaining our top line momentum as we continue to execute on our strategic priorities.\nExcluding book of business activity, organic revenue growth at the enterprise level would have been 10%. This solid result was fueled by the great efforts of our colleagues, the strength of our global client model, the investments we've made in talent and technology and the resiliency of our business. Notably, our bottom line performance this quarter was driven by 170 basis points of year-over-year adjusted operating margin expansion.\nThe positive impacts of both our recent cost saving measures and the growing productivity of our new hires led to a strong finish for the quarter. Additionally, we realized $23 million of incremental annualized savings from our transformation program during the third quarter. This brings the total to $300 million in cumulative annualized savings since the program's inception.\nWe are well positioned for further adjusted operating margin expansion over the long term, driven by organic revenue growth from our unique offerings and strategic hires, the continued progress of our transformation program and a strengthened focus on cost discipline.\nIn the near term, we expect year-over-year margin expansion for the fourth quarter and the full year as a result of operating leverage and increasing contributions from our expense management initiatives. We're pleased with our third quarter performance and our progress gives us confidence in our ability to drive profitable growth and create value over the long term.\nAs I touched on last quarter, our focus on specialization in our Risk & Broking segment has been one of the key drivers of our strong organic growth. We've generated substantial momentum by developing innovative products and services, engaging in strategic partnerships, and building platforms like MGAs, MGUs and affinity products. For example, one of our major client wins for the quarter included an affinity solution that delivers compelling insurance products via digital channels to customers of a major manufacturer of luxury vehicles. This showcased our specialized expertise in the automotive industry and high net worth personal lines of business as well as our successful track record in global affinity insurance programs.\nOur strategic focus on specialization continues to drive strong growth in our specialty lines, which continue to grow much faster than our average R&B growth. As we've mentioned last quarter, based on the strong market response we've seen to date, we're expanding our pursuit of these initiatives. For example, we recently announced that WTW will launch Verita, a new MGU focused on select industries which will further advance our specialization strategy and risk and broking in North America. Verita will initially focus on the industry verticals of real estate, hospitality and leisure, financial institutions and professional services.\nOur deep knowledge of these industries together with our insurance expertise will enable Verita to have a comprehensive understanding of our clients' risks. This will allow us to offer best-in-class holistic insurance solutions while maintaining underwriting discipline.\nThe target customers for Verita are growing companies seeking more flexible, tailored insurance solutions. And overtime, we aim to expand Verita into more industries as we grow the platform.\nOur analytic tools and expertise in insurance advisory and brokerage give our clients confidence that they're getting the best value for their premium dollars. This quarter, our portfolio was expanded to include the global actuarial review for a leading P&C insurer and the brokerage of a global renewal energy program by a world-class player in the energy sector.\nData analytics and specialty expertise are also key growth drivers for our Health, Wealth and Career segment. For example, we've had record success for our compensation benchmarking participation in sales with more than 43,000 companies participating in our surveys at the end of September. And we've introduced new talent intelligence reports, which examine hot skills and high-demand jobs across industries to help our clients make better informed decisions on work and rewards issues.\nWe've also continued to build our health care benchmarking and specialty services. Earlier this year, we enhanced our pharmacy offering with an expansion of our Rx Collaborative and a new product for mid-market organizations. This past quarter, we launched 2 new pharmacy partnerships to help plan members save on costs. Another key to our HWC success is the differentiated smart connections we're making across businesses and geographies. A client's simple request for data can lead to additional consulting opportunities for us. It's also done to enhance our solution systematically.\nOur updated workforce management offering, which combines financial analysis, health assessment and communication tools is but one example that led to millions of dollars of incremental revenue this past quarter. Another example is our LifeSight solution, our defined contribution pooled employer plan. We've expanded LifeSight to the U.S. earlier this year and are pleased to report that we've contracted with our first U.S. client while we added clients with $2.5 billion of asset value in Great Britain, Ireland and Belgium.\nAcross WTW, the confluence of innovation and collaboration is driving consistent, sustainable growth. I'm energized by how our journey to 1 WTW is increasingly delivering new opportunities made possible by bringing together our diverse capabilities. Finally, I want to touch on capital allocation. As we've said in the past, we'll continue to take a balanced approach with a focus on allocating our capital to the highest return opportunities.\nIn the third quarter, we bought back $350 million of stock and expanded our repurchase authorization, demonstrating that share repurchases remain our top priority.\nAs we enter the fourth quarter, I'm encouraged by the strong client response to the hard work we've done growing, simplifying and transforming our business. We continue to see momentum building as our unique offerings help clients evaluate and manage their risks and opportunities in a complex macro environment. We are committed to harnessing this momentum to drive greater operating leverage over time. We believe that our transformation program and disciplined expense management, combined with consistent and sustainable growth opportunities will support near-term and long-term margin expansion.\nI want to thank our colleagues for their performance this quarter. I'm truly appreciative of their dedication, service and continued commitment to our vision. Now before turning it over to Andrew, I'd also like to acknowledge the escalating conflict in the Middle East, the violence, devastation, loss of life and impact on innocent civilians are profoundly saddening. Our primary focus in times of tragedy is on the safety of our colleagues and their families. Thankfully, our colleagues who work in the region continue to be safe. We remain in regular contact and are providing the assistance they need. We support all of our colleagues and clients as well as their friends and family in the region as they cope with this difficult situation.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Andrew.\n\nAndrew Krasner\n\nThanks, Carl. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. As Carl mentioned, our third quarter revenue was up 9% on an organic basis. And excluding book of business activity, organic revenue growth would have been 10%. This growth reflects the increasing productivity of our new hires and the impact of our strategic focus on specialization and risk and broking and increased demand from clients seeking solutions to manage the impact of inflation on health care costs, pensions, retirement plans and human capital in HWC.\nI'm very pleased with the progress of our transformation program, which delivered $23 million of incremental annualized savings during the third quarter. This brings the total to $151 million in cumulative annualized savings this year. Our progress on the transformation program and our strength and focus on cost management will help us drive continued operating leverage.\nI will now discuss our detailed segment results. Note that to provide comparability with prior periods, all commentary regarding the results of our segments will be on an organic basis, unless specifically stated otherwise. Health, Wealth and Career generated revenue growth of 9% on an organic basis and 8% on a constant currency basis compared to the third quarter of last year. We feel confident in our pipeline and anticipate that the segment will finish off the year with good results and in line with historical trends.\nRevenue for health increased 7% for the quarter or 8% without considering the impact of book of business activity. We delivered solid growth across all regions, driven by the continued expansion of our global benefits management client portfolio, new local clients, expanding consulting work for existing clients and increased brokerage income.\nWealth grew 7% in the third quarter. The growth was primarily attributable to strong momentum in return with increased derisking activity and consulting work in North America. Retirement also grew in Europe as a result of derisking work, regulatory compliance support and pension brokerage. Investments grew as a result of new client acquisitions and higher fees, which more than offset headwinds from the negative impact of capital market performance. Career delivered 8% growth in the quarter, driven by increased compensation survey sales, executive compensation work and other word-based advisory services, including paid transparency work, and change communication services.\nBenefits delivery and outsourcing generated 14% growth in the quarter. The increase was driven by strength in outsourcing for new clients and increased compliance and other project activity and individual marketplace with growth from higher volumes and placements of life and Medicare Advantage policies.\nAs a reminder, we typically generate about 50% of the revenue for our individual marketplace business during the fourth quarter, and we expect the growth next quarter to be relatively in line with historical trends. HWC's operating margin increased 350 basis points from the prior year third quarter to 23.8%. This margin increase was attributable to both improved operating leverage and transformation savings. Operating leverage was driven by a positive spread with revenue outpacing expense growth and some timing between quarters.\nRisk & Broking revenue was up 10% on both an organic and constant currency basis compared to the prior year third quarter. Excluding the $10 million year-over-year impact from book of business activity, risk and broking grew at an exceptional 12%.\nAs a reminder, there were about $10 million of book of business sales in R&B in the fourth quarter of 2022. We currently expect a similar amount of book of business settlements next quarter, and therefore, do not expect a meaningful year-over-year impact from book of business activity in Q4. However, the timing for settlements can be difficult to predict and may drag into the following year.\nCorporate Risk and Broking had another strong quarter delivering organic revenue growth of 10% and continuing the positive growth trajectory we have seen over recent quarters. Excluding book of business activity, CRB grew at 12%. This result was primarily driven by strong new business growth and improved client retention. Pricing had a moderate positive impact on the quarter.\nInterest income was up $19 million for the quarter due to higher rates and the reclassification of interest income previously recorded in corporate. As noted last quarter, due to the cessation of the co-broking agreement with Gallagher, interest income directly associated with risk and broking fiduciary funds is now allocated to the segment.\nThe exceptional growth in Q3 was also driven by continued strong return on investment in our specialty lines. Globally, the strongest growth came from our facultative financial solutions, natural resources, surety and construction lines of business.\nEurope had an exceptional quarter with double-digit growth in a number of countries led by our P&C retail and direct business as well as construction, aerospace and financial solutions. International also contributed to strong organic growth led by Latin America.\nNorth America benefited from strong new business and increased client retention across most lines of business despite headwinds in our M&A business and from the impact of book of business activity.\nIn the Insurance Consulting and Technology business, revenue was up 9% over the prior year period, driven by increased sales in technology solutions, including strong new business and higher project activity. R&B's operating margin was 15.7% for the third quarter, an increase of 200 basis points compared to the prior year third quarter. The expected ramp-up in production from our strategic hiring efforts drove greater operating leverage while tailwinds from increased interest income were offset by headwinds from gain on sale activity and foreign currency.\nIncreased contribution from transformation as well as targeted expense management measures we put in place earlier this year also contributed meaningfully to margin expansion. We are beginning to see our expense management actions deliver results including coordinated efforts on reducing spend for internal travel and vendor spend. We continue to expect these actions to benefit our margin next quarter.\nTurning back to enterprise level results. Our adjusted operating margin was 16.2%, a 170 basis point increase over prior year. Excluding book of business activity, the margin would have increased 220 basis points year-over-year, benefiting from transformation savings as well as the impact of interest income. The net result was adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.24.\nForeign exchange had a minimal impact on EPS for the third quarter. Assuming today's rates continue for the remainder of the year, we now expect a foreign currency headwind on adjusted earnings per share of $0.07 for the year. Our U.S. GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 15.5% versus 0.7% in the prior year.\nOur adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 24.3% compared to 16.8% in the prior year reflecting the nonrecurring nature of discrete tax benefits reflected in the prior year rate. We continue to expect the full year adjusted tax rate to be modestly above the prior year.\nOur strong balance sheet gives us continued confidence in our ability to execute a disciplined capital allocation strategy that balances capital return to shareholders with internal investments and strategic M&A to deploy our capital in what we believe to be the highest return opportunities.\nDuring the quarter, we paid $88 million in dividends and repurchased approximately 1.7 million shares for $350 million. As Carl mentioned, we continue to view share repurchases as an attractive use of capital to create long-term shareholder value. Last month, we raised our repurchase authorization by $1 billion of which approximately $1.5 billion remains. In the first half of the year, we had about $450 million of share repurchases. We expect a similar amount for the second half of the year, subject to market conditions, among other relevant factors.\nAdditionally, we repaid $250 million of debt that matured during the quarter with a portion of the proceeds from our May debt issuance. Year-to-date, we have generated free cash flow of $707 million compared to free cash flow of $337 million during the same period in the prior year. The improvement of $370 million was due to the nonrecurrence of prior year headwinds, including realized losses on foreign currency hedges, payments made in the prior year for certain discretionary compensation and taxes for onetime gains recorded in connection with the Willis Retail and the deal termination payment. These tailwinds were partially offset by increased transformation program-related costs.\nWe are very pleased with our improving business performance and expect this momentum to continue for the rest of the year. I am very proud of the leadership team and the resolve of our colleagues and the continued support of our clients. Our investments in talent, innovation and operational transformation have helped drive organic revenue growth, and we are confident that this will translate into sustained growth in margins, EPS and free cash flow.\nAnd with that, let's open it up for Q&A."

Please go ahead.\n\nCarl A. Hess\n\nHead of Investment, Risk & Reinsurance, Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company\n\nGood morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for WTW Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. Joining me today is Andrew Krasner, our Chief Financial Officer. We continue to see our strategic initiatives resonate strongly in the marketplace as reflected in the 7% organic revenue growth we recorded in the second quarter. This solid result reflected continued strong growth across our entire portfolio of businesses despite significant challenges from outsized book of business sales in each of our segments in the prior year. Excluding book of business activity, organic revenue growth at the enterprise level would have been 9%. We're very encouraged by the sustained top line momentum and the positive response we've seen from clients to our investments in talented technology across all our businesses.\nAt the same time, we faced margin headwinds from those investments as well as wage inflation in prior year book sales that limited our progress on driving margin expansion and earnings growth this quarter. The continued success of our transformation program, which exceeded our expectations yet again partially offset these headwinds. All in all, adjusted operating margin declined by 90 basis points for the quarter, which resulted in adjusted earnings per share of $2.05. Though we had a decline in adjusted operating margin this quarter, as we've said before, our progress in margin expansion won't always be linear. However, we don't expect margin declines in any full year period.\nEarlier this morning, we reset our 2024 adjusted operating margin and adjusted EPS targets. These updates reflect our margin and earnings performance to date and as we've called out in the previous quarters, the Pension Income headwinds that based on current market conditions, we do not expect to subside. Importantly, they also include our current assessment of the opportunities we see ahead of us with the benefit of being halfway through our 3-year plan. We lowered our 2024 target for adjusted operating margin to 22.5% to 23.5% from 23% to 24%. While some of the change stems from the slower pace at which we generate operating leverage, it primarily reflects our opportunistic decision to further invest in talent and other key strategic initiatives, especially in our Risk & Broking segment. This incremental investment will further strengthen our long-term market position and drive continued strong organic growth beyond the 2024 forecast period.\nTo elaborate a bit on that decision, I want to say a few words about where our R&D segment stands today and the opportunity going forward. Our differentiated service offering, underpinned by our ability to adapt to our clients' changing needs creates an incredibly compelling value proposition and the success of this strategy in R&B so far is evident through the strong organic growth we've been able to deliver. Our focus on specialization, innovation and top quality client service has generated substantial momentum and opportunities we did not have 18 months ago.\nEarlier this month, our Aerospace team won back the Airbus account, one of the largest in the sector on the back of our strengthened value proposition. And that success is not just happening in aerospace, our global lines of business, such as P&C, Marine and Financial solutions have continued to deliver meaningfully above market growth, including double-digit growth in the second quarter. In North America, the build-out of 12 identified industry divisions continues at pace with colleagues and infrastructure being aligned, and we expect most of this to be completed by year-end. Our traction in the marketplace has shown us there are even more opportunities here to deliver solid organic growth well into the future.\nBut a 6th strategy is simply not an option in today's ever-changing risk landscape. To capitalize on these opportunities and meet client-specific needs, we're continuing to advance our specialization strategy and develop innovative products and services, which will distinguish us in a way to best attract clients and talent. This requires developing differentiated offerings, increasing strategic partnerships and expanding our reach through platforms like MGAs, MGUs and affinity products. Of course, high-quality talent is essential to drive these initiatives and turn our vision into a reality. And we see our rejuvenated strategy and independent brand become a load start for that talent, which will further fuel our success.\nWe do appreciate the need to strike a balance between investing for incremental growth in the long term and capturing savings in the near term. While this investment in talent will partially offset the savings from our transformation program and tailwinds from higher investment income and lower pension service costs between now and 2024, we expect these efforts will drive greater operating leverage over the long term as productivity improves and we realize more efficiency from increased scale. Running a successful business is never a straight line. It's a journey filled with triumph and challenges, and we've experienced both over the last 18 months.\nOn one hand, the operating margin has benefited from our accelerated progress on the transformation program, interest income has been higher and our pension-related service costs have been more favorable than originally expected. At the same time, macroeconomic conditions have dampened demand for interest rate-sensitive businesses, such as M&A, and the inflationary environment has put pressure on our operating costs, driving up wages and travel and entertainment. We are also focused on implementing cost-saving measures primarily focused on eliminating nonessential travel. While we've seen some progress in generating margin expansion from R&B, we know there is more to do, we remain confident that the right path to delivering margin expansion includes both driving organic revenue growth through our strategic investments and executing on transformation program savings and efficiency measures.\nAs a core part of our strategic decision to invest further in our specialization strategy and our talent base, we are excited to welcome Lucy Clark as the global leader of Risk & Broking in the third quarter of 2024. Lucy's committed to specialization, exceptional client service and data and analytics, all directly aligned with WTW's competitive advantages and what we're doing in this space, making her the right person to accelerate the execution of our strategy. She has extraordinary market presence, a proven track record of delivering operational and financial results and an intense focus on talent. We are delighted she is being our team, and I look forward to welcoming Lucy to our team in the third quarter of 2024. Until then, Adam Garrad will continue to lead the segment. And after Lucy's arrival, Adam will become the Chairman of Risk & Broking.\nNow let me shift gears back to our updated 2024 adjusted EPS target. The revised target of $15.40 to $17 reflects the sizable pension income headwinds we've discussed on previous calls, a modestly higher expected tax rate and the lower adjusted operating margin. The revised target also reflects a more narrow and precise range than our original figures given that we're halfway through our target period of 3 years. I've already talked about the drivers behind our margins. So let me take a minute to cover the other 2 items. The most significant driver influencing our change to our EPS target is a sizable decline in expected pension income since we set our original 2024 target almost 2 years ago. We originally expected Pension Income to contribute $2 to $2.50 to adjusted EPS. As we've communicated previously, the increase in interest rates and decline in capital market returns have created significant headwinds to Pension Income dynamics. As a result, we now expect Pension Income to contribute $0.35 to $0.85, less than half of our original estimate to adjusted EPS in 2024. The change in expected pension income accounts for approximately $1.55 of the overall change in EPS target. We continue to expect Pension Income of $112 million in 2023 and we'll update you on our 2024 pension expectations during our fourth quarter call after the remeasurement process.\nThe second driver impacting the EPS target change stems from the modest increase in tax rate due to our updated estimates of future tax rates based on legislative changes. We expect the U.K. corporate tax rate increase will have a modest impact starting in 2023. While we continue to evaluate the OECT/G20 guidance on the Pillar 2 global minimum tax released earlier this year, we expect the legislative changes may further increase the rate in 2024 and forward.\nNow before I hand it over to Andrew, I want to step back for a moment and reflect on the progress of WTW since the tumult of 2021. In 2021, WTW had $9 billion of revenue and adjusted operating margin of 19.9% and EPS of $11.60. And the full impact of the termination of the business combination was not reflected in the company's financial results in that time. That occurred in 2022 when organic growth slowed, book of business sale activity spiked, and we need to make substantial investment in both talent and transformation-related activities to position the company for future growth. Since that time, we've stabilized our business, we build our talent base, significantly strengthened organic revenue growth, optimize capital management return significant capital to shareholders and are transforming and simplifying our company to drive greater profitability. We are in a far better place from where we started.\nWe remain committed to our strategic priorities of Grow, Simplify and Transform and we are delivering meaningful strategic progress against these initiatives. We can see their contributions to our performance, including organic growth in line with our payers and $277 million of transformation savings. We remain committed to improving our core operating results to reach our revised 2024 goals and drive long-term earnings growth. I want to thank our colleagues for their dedication and performance this quarter. We are truly appreciative of their continued dedication to our vision and their relentless focus on our strategic priorities to grow, simplify and transform.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Andrew.\n\nAndrew Jay Krasner\n\nCFO, Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company\n\nThanks, Carl. Good morning, everyone. Thanks to all of you for joining us today. Before we delve into the financials, I want to provide some additional color on our free cash flow to help paint a clearer picture of our core free cash flow performance and our outlook. First, I want to explain why we are focused on free cash flow margin or free cash flow as a percentage of revenue rather than some of the other potential metrics. The noncash nature of our pension income can distort various free cash flow conversion calculations, whether you're calculating free cash flow conversion as a percentage of net income, adjusted net income or adjusted EBITDA. We, therefore, think free cash flow as a percentage of revenue or free cash flow margin is a clearer and more meaningful metric to track free cash flow.\nNext, I'd like to remind you of the nonrecurring items that impacted our 2022 cash flow performance. In 2022, our free cash flow margin decreased to 8%, reflecting strong revenue growth and margin expansion partially offset by some significant nonrecurring items, including delayed cash tax payments for the 2021 gains recorded in connection with the sale of Willis Re and the deal termination fee, realized losses on foreign currency hedges and onetime retention and executive compensation costs. Adjusted for these onetime headwinds, our 2022 free cash flow margin would have been approximately 14%. We consider this a normalized baseline for 2022. Adding the approximately 200 basis point increase in transformation-related spend for 2023 and gets us to approximately 12% free cash flow margin, which we think is a reasonable guidepost for 2023.\nLooking beyond 2023, we expect to see free cash flow margin increase driven by improved cash conversion in our TransAct business and the abatement of transformation-related spend. Collectively, these items are expected to contribute over 400 basis points to our free cash flow margin over the long term. Starting from the 12% free cash flow margin expected for 2023 this expansion in free cash flow margin on top of our expected organic revenue growth should drive strong long-term growth in free cash flow. Additionally, we expect incremental upside driven by improved profitability and working capital improvement actions. Thus, we think 16% plus is a reasonable long-term guidepost.\nI'd like to spend a few minutes expanding on how we expect each of these components to contribute to greater free cash flow and improved working capital over the long term. Let's start with improved cash conversion at TransAct. About 8% of our revenue comes from TransAct, which has tripled in size since we acquired it in Q3 2019. However, the cash conversion dynamics of this business are different than the rest of our businesses. Q4 is TransAct's largest revenue quarter, and that revenue consists of both fees and commissions. The commissions, which reflect both our initial placement plus estimated future renewals can take up to 5 to 6 years in total for us to collect depending on the product. Meanwhile, we incur significant upfront cash costs to place the policies, creating a working capital headwind as the business grows.\nIn 2022, growth in TransAct created an approximately 200 basis point headwind on our free cash flow margin. Over the last few years of rapid growth in that business, we have generated a long-term contract asset, which is essentially a large long-term receivable. We expect to collect this over multiple years as policies are renewed. As our TransAct business continues to mature and cash collections from earlier periods outpaced the upfront cash outflows incurred in connection with the continued top line growth, we expect this working capital headwind to subside and over time become a tailwind and begin contributing positively to free cash flow margin.\nOur overall individual marketplace strategy combines TransAct with its strong revenue growth prospects and current lower cash flow generation with a mature business of Extend Health, which has lower revenue growth but strong cash flow. Together, the 2 businesses give us an overall Medicare operation with a strong growth profile and positive cash flow as was the case for 2022.\nMoving on to the impact of our Transformation Program. We made substantial progress on the program in 2022 and have accelerated that progress in 2023. Funding the Transformation Program required approximately $200 million in cash outflow in 2022, which translated to a roughly 230 basis point headwind to our free cash flow margin. Investment in the Transformation Program will continue to pressure our free cash flow until it is complete at the end of 2024. But beginning in 2025, the abatement of program-related spending will drive an increase in free cash flow margin.\nThe last point I'd like to cover is the upside from greater profitability. We continue to expect to drive margin expansion from current levels to our target range over the next 6 quarters. As our adjusted operating margin grows, so too will our free cash flow margin. In addition, we expect some of our specific transformation program initiatives to have a positive but more modest impact on free cash flow margin. Our finance and operational transformation initiatives include a number of tactical working capital improvement opportunities such as centralizing and standardizing our billing and collections processes, expanding automation capabilities, and capturing long-term structural and contractual improvements to the cash aspects of how our businesses operate. Also, the transformation of our real estate footprint should reduce our long-term CapEx needs.\nTogether, all of these actions, along with the continued adjusted operating margin expansion beyond 2024 should drive incremental improvements in our free cash flow margin above the roughly 400 basis points we've quantified.\nTurning to our results for the quarter. Our second quarter revenue was up 7% on an organic basis. Excluding book of business activity, organic revenue growth at the enterprise level would have been 9%. Our Transformation Program delivered $53 million of incremental annualized savings during the second quarter. This brings the total to $128 million in cumulative annualized savings this year, far exceeding our original target of $100 million of incremental savings for 2023. Accordingly, we're raising our guidance on cumulative run rate transformation savings actioned by the end of 2023 to $160 million. The additional transformation savings we've identified also support an increase to the total annual cost savings we expect the program to deliver by the end of 2024 from over $360 million to $380 million.\nI will now discuss our detailed segment results. Note that to provide comparability with prior periods, all commentary regarding the results of our segments will be on an organic basis unless specifically stated otherwise. The Health, Wealth and Career segment generated revenue growth of 5% on both an organic and constant currency basis compared to the second quarter of last year. The segment had solid organic revenue growth despite significant headwinds from book of business activity in the prior year, which negatively impacted organic revenue growth by 2 percentage points. We continue to see growth opportunities across the portfolio of businesses and expect that they will continue their growth trajectory for the rest of the year.\nRevenue for Health increased 4% for the quarter or 9% when excluding the impact of book of business activity in the prior year. Primarily due to natural portfolio growth and new client appointments in international and Europe and higher levels of project work at brokerage income in North America. Wealth grew 5% in the second quarter. The growth was primarily attributable to higher levels of retirement work in North America and Europe. Our investments business also contributed to organic revenue growth with new client acquisitions and higher fees related to value-added services. Career delivered 4% growth in the quarter, driven by increased demand for reward-based advisory services and higher compensation survey participation. Benefits Delivery & Outsourcing generated 7% growth in the quarter. The increase was driven by strength in individual marketplace with growth from higher volumes and placements of Medicare Advantage and Life Policies as well as increased project activity in outsourcing.\nHWC's operating margin decreased 40 basis points from the prior year second quarter to 18.3%. This margin decrease was primarily due to the impact of book of business activity, partially offset by transformation savings. Risk & Broking revenue was up 6% on an organic basis and on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year second quarter. Risk & Broking had strong organic revenue growth despite significant book of business headwinds and excluding the impact from book of business settlements, Risk & Broking grew 10%. Corporate Risk & Broking had another strong quarter and continued the positive growth trajectory we have seen over the last quarters with an organic revenue increase of 7%. Excluding book of business activity, CRB grew at 11% with double-digit growth in all geographies. This outstanding result is primarily driven by strong new business, continued improvement of our client retention and strong contributions of 13% organic growth from our specialty lines like Marine Financial Solutions and Large and Complex P&C.\nOur specialty lines of business are a critical area for us, and we are making meaningful investments to position us for long-term success, and we are growing at a much faster pace in these lines of business. Furthermore, while rate increases continue to have a positive impact, they had a more moderate impact compared to prior year. Interest income was up $9 million for the quarter due to higher rates. As noted in our earnings release and as a result of the cessation of the co-broking agreement with Gallagher, interest income directly associated with Risk & Broking fiduciary funds will be allocated to the segment beginning in third quarter of 2023. These amounts were previously allocated to the corporate segment. I would just point out that this will be done on a prospective basis only, and there is no impact to the Q2 numbers.\nNorth America had a strong quarter due to new business and increased retention. Europe also had solid new business performance across most product lines, including P&C, Marine, Aerospace and Financial Solutions. International also contributed to organic growth led by Latin America. In the Insurance Consulting and Technology business, revenue was up 3% over the prior year period, driven by increased sales in Technology Solutions and higher project activity. R&D's operating margin was 16.1% for the second quarter compared to 19.7% in the prior year second quarter. Margin headwinds reflected the impact of the gain on sale from book of business activity in the prior year, along with the adverse timing impact from prior year incentive credits that have no impact on full year margins, but negatively impacted the quarter.\nHowever, we saw an increase in our comp and bend run rate due to strategic investment hires. These key hires have begun to contribute to our performance in a meaningful way as exemplified by the strong organic growth for the first half of the year. We continue to expect a ramp-up in production which we anticipate will cover the increase in expenses. We are also facing expense headwinds due to the increased client activity and inflationary increases on travel, entertainment and marketing that we are actively managing with strict cost management actions which we expect to yield a greater benefit in the second half of the year. Partially offsetting these margin headwinds were transformation savings that continue to contribute as planned as well as the impact of interest income.\nTurning back to enterprise level results. Our adjusted operating margin was 14.6%, a 90 basis point decline over prior year, primarily a result of costs related to employee headcount increases and inflation as well as headwinds from the margin impact of book of business sales in the prior year. The decline in margin was partially offset by transformation savings as well as the impact of interest income. The net result was adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.05. Foreign exchange had a de minimis impact on EPS for the second quarter. Assuming today's rates continue for the remainder of the year, we continue to expect a foreign currency headwind on adjusted earnings per share of $0.05 for the year. Our U.S. GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 19.8% versus 10.5% in the prior year. Our adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 23.7% compared to 20.5% in the prior year reflecting the nonrecurring nature of discrete tax benefits reflected in the prior year rate.\nOur strong balance sheet gives us continued confidence in our ability to execute a disciplined capital allocation strategy that balances capital return to shareholders with internal investments and strategic M&A to deploy our capital in the highest return opportunities. During the quarter, we paid $90 million in dividends and repurchased approximately 1.5 million shares for $350 million. Given our confidence in achieving the plan we've laid out, we continue to view share repurchases as an attractive use of capital to create long-term shareholder value. We also actively manage our leverage profile by issuing $750 million of new debt in May, and a portion of those proceeds will be used to pay our debt with an upcoming maturity in the third quarter.\nWe generated free cash flow of $350 million for the second quarter of 2023 compared to free cash flow of $198 million in the prior year. The improvement of $152 million is primarily due to the nonrecurrence of payments made in the prior year for certain discretionary compensation and taxes for onetime gains recorded in connection with the Willis Resale and the income receipt related to deal termination. These tailwinds were partially offset by increased transformation program-related costs.\nOverall, while we recognize we have more to do, we continue to be encouraged by the meaningful traction we are getting with clients through our strategic initiatives. Delivering strong organic revenue growth is a prerequisite for sustainably growing margins, EPS and free cash flow. We are confident in our market position and in our ability to deliver on the improvement opportunities we see today.\nWith that, let's open it up for Q&A."

Please go ahead.\n\nCarl A. Hess\n\nCEO & Director, Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company\n\nGood morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for WTW's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. Joining me today is Andrew Krasner, our Chief Financial Officer.\nThe first quarter marked a solid start to our year, with results that were in line with our expectations and reflect improved momentum in our business. We generated organic revenue growth of 2% and expanded adjusted operating margins by 200 basis points, driven by new business generation and continued expense discipline.\nWe also continue to focus on executing our capital allocation strategy and have now completed $4.1 billion in share repurchases since our 2021 Investor Day. Overall, we've had a solid start to the year and remain confident in our ability to deliver on our financial goals for both 2022 and the longer term.\nBefore discussing our strategic progress and operating results, I'd like to share our heartbreak and dismay over the crisis in Ukraine. We wholeheartedly wish for a peaceful solution and remain steadfast in our support for all our colleagues and their families in the region who have been affected. Their safety and well-being have been top of mind in the past months.\nWTW has been in daily contact with any colleagues who've chosen to remain in the Ukraine and provided financial and accommodation support to those who chose to relocate. Our own special contingency risks operation is providing guidance and assistance to our Ukraine country leader. We're also encouraging our colleagues to utilize our matching gifts program to help increase financial donations for disaster relief. I'm proud of how our colleagues who come together in support. Thank you for showing up for each other.\nIn addition to supporting our employees, WTW is supporting clients in key areas related to this crisis, including claims and risk across various lines such as political, investment, supply chain and cyber.\nAs previously announced, WTW decided to withdraw from our business in Russia and transfer ownership to local management who will operate independently in the Russian market. In a few minutes, Andrew will talk more about the financial impact of our decision to exit Russia.\nNow I'd like to provide a few updates on our progress against our company-wide priorities. At our last Investor Day, we unveiled our grow, simplify and transform strategy, and we executed against each of these strategic priorities during the first quarter. Innovation has always been a key area of focus for us. And as One WTW, we strive to bring the diverse capabilities of the enterprise together to innovate on behalf of our clients to address current and unmet needs, and we continue to do so in the first quarter.\nLet me walk you through just a few examples. Our Risk and Broking segment launched ESG analytics and diagnostics, which provides a multisource comprehensive analysis of a firm's ESG performance. We also introduced a bespoke reputational risk solution designed to help our clients understand, manage and recover from reputational crises. Both products address ESG risk, which is an area of rapidly growing importance for our clients. Our ongoing product innovation continues to drive growth in our Risk & Analytics business within Risk and Broking.\nIn Health, Wealth and Career, we unveiled a new employee insights platform called Engage to help clients understand their employees' views on various topics that affect the employee experience and, ultimately, business performance. We've had fantastic client feedback on Engage to date and are excited about its potential.\nI'm pleased to say that our commitment to innovation continues to be recognized by the industry. During the quarter, WTW secured the top spot in Advisen's Pacesetter Index and annual recognition of product innovation leadership in the P&C insurance industry. WTW topped the index having launched 16 new products and services in 2021. I'm proud of our team for earning this recognition, which reinforces our capabilities and our dedication to delivering innovative and actionable solutions for today's complex challenges in people, risk and capital.\nAt our Investor Day, I also spoke to you about our actions to simplify the business and make it easier and quicker to engage with our clients as we work to bring the best of WTW to them. We've advanced on this front as well, refocusing the company into 2 operating segments across 3 geographies to create a more streamlined structure and enhance the agility of the team while also enabling us to leverage common technology, platforms and processes.\nWe also shared our focus on transforming WTW to enhance speed to market and promote efficiency, and I'm encouraged by the progress we've made on our transformation initiatives. We realized $16 million of incremental annualized savings during the first quarter, bringing the total to $36 million since the program's inception. This exceeds our original $30 million target for all of 2022. And as part of this program, we introduced WTW work styles, a program which modernizes the way we work to align our real estate footprint to a hybrid working environment and contributes to our transformation program savings. WTW work styles reflects our belief that colleagues can be successful working in a variety of our ways and our confidence that a high-performing culture is the result of exceptional talent, not real estate.\nSpeaking of talent, our rate of hiring in the first quarter accelerated by 23% compared to the fourth quarter of 2021, reaching our highest hiring volume in a single quarter since 2019. Our new hires in sales and client management roles tripled compared to the first quarter last year. We also continue to see retention efforts gain more traction in Q1, with voluntary attrition dropping 19% from Q4 of 2021 and a significant decline in senior level departures. We've seen the same positive dynamics play out in our Corporate Risk & Broking segment.\nLet me take a minute now to touch on some of our financial highlights for the quarter. On an organic basis, revenue was up 2%, reflecting growth across most of our businesses. Adjusted operating income was $371 million or 17.2% of revenue for the quarter, up 200 basis points from $338 million or 15.2% of revenue in the same period last year as our growth and expense discipline combined to enhance our profitability in the period. Net result was adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.66, representing 22% growth over the prior year, in part due to our aggressive share repurchase program.\nOverall, our performance in the quarter was aligned with our expectations and reflected our commitment to profitable growth and the successful execution of our strategy. We continue to build momentum, and we believe our progress has us on track to reach our financial goals for 2022 and to become a $10 billion plus company by 2024.\nIn closing, I want to express my gratitude to my incredible team of colleagues who live our values and have delivered every day for our clients in a volatile and challenging environment. With our sharpened focus, we are well positioned to continue driving growth and executing on our transformation.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Andrew for more detail on our results.\n\nAndrew Jay Krasner\n\nCFO, Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company\n\nThanks, Carl. Good morning, everyone. Thanks to all of you for joining us so early in the day.\nThe first quarter saw dramatic macroeconomic and geopolitical changes that required us to navigate rapid and significant shifts in our markets that we expect will continue to evolve throughout the year. High inflation, uncertainty around how long it will last and tight labor supply are impacting our clients' people strategies in a variety of ways. Geopolitical and economic factors are affecting the insurance landscape, with events in Ukraine likely to dampen the short-term moderation in pricing growth. Monetary policy and inflationary forces are expected to translate into remeasured asset values and exposures, ultimately translating into premium growth. We continue to navigate through this complex and dynamic backdrop and have delivered a good start to the year, with most of our businesses contributing to organic revenue growth.\nBefore we turn to our detailed segment results, let me take a moment to touch on our exit from our Russian businesses. As we previously reported, we made the decision to exit our operations in Russia, which comprised approximately 1% of consolidated WTW revenue for 2021, primarily within our Risk and Broking segment. The lost profits from our Russia operations will create modest margin headwinds for the company in 2022 and beyond. However, we have taken swift action to deploy near-term cost mitigation measures and to identify longer-term offsets, which gives us confidence in achieving our guidance for the year and reaching our 2024 financial goals.\nLet's turn to our detailed segment results. Note that to provide clear comparability with all periods, all commentary regarding the results of our segments will be on an organic basis, unless specifically stated otherwise.\nThe Health, Wealth and Career, or HWC segment, generated revenue growth of 2% on an organic basis and 3% on a constant currency basis compared to the first quarter of the prior year. Career, which represents our Work & Rewards and Employee Experience businesses, led revenue growth for the segment, increasing 7% in the quarter, following growth of 3% in Q4 of 2021. This growth was driven by strong demand for rewards consulting, pay benchmarking and software. Health, which is comprised of our Health and Benefits broking and consulting business, delivered strong growth of 6% through a combination of increased retention, new client appointments and project work. Wealth, which represents our Retirement and Investment businesses, had a revenue increase of 1% for the quarter, driven by growth from new clients.\nIn Benefits Delivery & Outsourcing, which encompasses our Benefits Delivery & Administration and benefit plan administration businesses, revenue declined by 2% from the prior year first quarter. The decline was largely driven by individual marketplace and reflected a shift in revenue timing from our B2B Medicare exchange business, which we expect to normalize over the course of 2022, as well as lower growth in Medicare Advantage revenue in our direct-to-consumer business. We continue to see a macro environment that supports growth opportunities for this business.\nHWC's operating margin expanded 110 basis points to 20.7% in the first quarter, driven primarily by strong operating leverage from our growth. We see HWC's historical industry-leading margins continuing. HWC's market-leading solutions and the tailwinds in its core markets should continue to drive organic growth. Both our near-term and long-term outlook on HWC remain positive.\nNow let's look at Risk and Broking, or R&B. R&B's revenue was flat on an organic and constant currency basis as compared to the prior year first quarter. Excluding a headwind from a book of business gain on sale that was recorded in the prior comparable period, Risk and Broking's organic revenue growth was 2%.\nIn the Insurance Consulting and Technology, or ICT business, revenue was up 9% compared to the prior year first quarter, with increased technology solutions sales alongside increased demand for advisory work. Corporate Risk & Broking, or CRB, revenue declined 1%. Excluding the book of business sale I mentioned earlier and Russia-related revenue, CRB increased 3% and, growth across all regions, primarily from new business with notable strength in our FINEX and M&A lines. Excluding headwinds from prior year book of business sales, North America led CRB's growth, where colleague retention rates at senior levels have continued to show significant improvement. Excluding our Russia business, international and Europe also contributed to CRB's growth.\nRisk and Broking's operating margin was 21.6% for the first quarter compared to 21.9% in the prior year first quarter. Excluding the headwind from book of business sale in the prior period, the margin increased 130 basis points for the first quarter as a result of top line growth alongside continued cost management. Risk and Broking's organic growth has trailed industry averages, primarily due to elevated colleague departures and reduced hiring during the period when the business combination was pending, 2 factors that we believe are now behind us. We continue to expect that the actions we have taken will enable us to narrow the growth gap over the course of the year, with pace accelerating in the second half of 2022 as the impacts of our actions build and headwinds subside. Overall, our outlook for Risk and Broking remains positive with mid-single-digit revenue growth expected over the longer term.\nNow let's turn to the enterprise level results. In Q1, we generated profitable growth with adjusted operating margins increasing 200 basis points to 17.2% from 15.2% in the prior year, a product of our focus on strategic priorities and cost management. We continue to expect margin improvement each year as we work to deliver on our 2024 margin goals.\nAs Carl mentioned, our transformation initiatives will be a key contributor to that ongoing margin expansion. Our early efforts in this area have been very successful, and we have already surpassed our $30 million annualized run rate savings goal for the year. We are actively seeking further cost transformation opportunities, and we'll update you as those progress.\nWe had free cash flow of negative $10 million for the first quarter of 2022, a $155 million increase from free cash flow of negative $165 million in the prior year. Approximately $50 million of the increase was core free cash flow improvement while the remaining $105 million was driven by onetime items. The onetime items consist primarily of legal settlement paid -- payments made in the prior year, totaling $185 million, partially offset by a net $80 million in other nonrecurring items, such as cash inflows from now divested businesses like Reinsurance, which increased prior year free cash flow, and cash payments related to transaction and transformation costs, which decreased current year free cash flow.\nWe continue to prioritize returning capital to shareholders and executed aggressively on those commitments. We paid $98 million in dividends for the first quarter of 2022 and repurchased 9.9 million shares for $2.25 billion, achieving the $4 billion near-term share repurchase target we set at Investor Day. At the end of Q1, approximately $1.6 billion remain under our current repurchase authorization. We remain committed to deploying excess capital and free cash flow into our highest return opportunities and continue to believe the return we can achieve from repurchasing shares remains highly attractive, and we expect to continue to deploy free cash flow in this manner.\nOverall, we're off to a good start in 2022. As we think about the rest of the year, we see macroeconomic challenges that will continue to create demand for our services and opportunities to help clients. We continue to feel positive about the investments we made in talent last year and this year. We are confident those investments will support revenue growth and that we will achieve our targets for the year.\nWith that, let's open it up for Q&A."

Please go ahead, sir.\n\nCarl A. Hess\n\nCEO & Director, Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company\n\nGood morning, everyone. Thank you for joining for WTW's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. Joining me today is Andrew Krasner, our Chief Financial Officer. Our third quarter performance reflects the increasing momentum we see in the business and our intense focus on delivering on our commitments. As projected, our organic revenue growth accelerated reaching 6% this quarter fueled by the great efforts of our colleagues and the strength of our global client model and further augmented by the investments we've made in talent and technology.\nWe generated adjusted diluted earnings of $2.20 per share and drove 110 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion, thanks to our transformation program, continued expense discipline and operating leverage from new business. We also continue to execute against our capital allocation strategy, completing $369 million in share repurchases in the third quarter. That brings our year-to-date total to $3.1 billion.\nWe're pleased with our third quarter performance and our progress executing our strategy to grow, simplify and transform gives us confidence in our ability to deliver against our guidance for 2022 and to drive growth and value creation over the long term.\nA year ago, at our Investor Day, we laid out our strategy for how we take WTW forward and deliver robust shareholder returns. Before getting into the details of the quarter, I want to provide you with an update on these initiatives. While it's still early in our journey, and there is more work to do, we have made substantial progress and are seeing encouraging signs that our investments and actions will yield the long-term improvement we expect. Our transformation efforts have made the most immediate impact. As I mentioned on our last earnings call, our focus on continuous improvement has helped us identify new opportunities and incremental sources of value as well as areas in which we can accelerate progress.\nDuring the third quarter, we realized $29 million of incremental annualized savings. This brings the total to $100 million in cumulative annualized savings since the program's inception, far exceeding our original $30 million target for 2022. Accordingly, we're raising our guidance on cumulative run rate transformation savings action by the end of 2022 from over $80 million to approximately $110 million. The additional transformation savings we've identified also supported increase to the total annual cost savings we expect the program to deliver by the end of 2024 from $300 million to $360 million. And as I said, there's still more work to do, and we will continue searching for additional opportunities.\nMeanwhile, our Simplify and Grow initiatives are powering the increasing momentum we see in the business. One of our key simplify activities has been streamlining shared operations to improve sales and retention outcomes. Our accelerated growth and robust pipeline demonstrate the progress we've made deploying this more agile model globally.\nFor our Grow initiatives, we remain focused on investment in both core and fast-growing markets and innovation to drive differentiation and better client outcomes. In Corporate Risk and Broking, our investments in specialized solutions and strategic hires for our global lines of business are meaningfully accelerating growth with most lines growing double digits this quarter.\nIn Health, Wealth and Career we've seen strong uptake of our solutions that are cross sold across the segment and are increasingly bundling products into our core advisory work.\nOur focus on innovation is driving improvements to existing solutions as well as launches of new products. For example, WTW's global payroll diagnostic tool is a sophisticated model, which provides refined evaluation of comprehensive catastrophe risks. The model clarifies exposure to terrorism in 12 natural perils and includes live event tracking for events such as pandemics, earthquakes, wind storms. We've recently enhanced this tool with hurricane tracking advisory and resiliency scoring, upgrading the sophisticated foundational tool with next-level analytics.\nAnalytics is a key area for new product development as well, including the recent launch of Risk Intelligence Quantified or Risk IQ. This flexible and crystallized platform provides risk specialists with autonomous access to the breadth of WTW's leading Risk & Analytics solutions. Risk IQ puts managers in control of their analytic outputs, providing patients with the ability to run business-critical scenarios and prepare for potential losses.\nWTW is at the forefront when it comes to delivering valuable strategic solutions across this market and Risk IQ further highlights our client-centric capabilities. Our new products reflect the evolution of our services to align with the changing needs of our clients.\nIn addition, our ongoing investments to rebuild our talent base are proceeding as expected. The pace of hiring in the third quarter matched that of the first half of the year. We also continue to see the benefit of retention efforts with voluntary attrition remaining in line with macro trends.\nOne Grow initiative from Investor Day that has not been a focus for us to date is inorganic expansion. While we expect share repurchases to remain the primary avenue for capital deployment, we are still committed to identifying attractive opportunities to strengthen our portfolio and add scale and fill gaps in our capabilities via acquisitions as part of our broader capital allocation strategy, particularly with the market now tilting in favor of buyers.\nOver the past year, we've developed a strong understanding of where we could benefit from deploying capital, which enables us to be a disciplined and opportunistic buyer. The progress we have made to date gives us confidence that WTW is on the right path but we also recognize that we have more work to do. We'll share a more detailed outlook for 2023 next quarter, and we continue to believe we will deliver on our long-term organic growth and margin expansion expectations.\nWhile we're on this topic, I wanted to take some time to discuss our decision to reflect the impact of the Russian divestiture in our 2024 guidance. As you know, during the first quarter of 2022, we announced our intention to transfer ownership of our Russian subsidiaries to local management and work to identify potential longer-term offsets to the impact of the exit. The transfer was completed in the third quarter, and given the current conditions, we do not anticipate resuming operations there in the foreseeable future. WTW's operations in Russia, which were almost entirely within our Risk and Broking segment, comprised approximately 1% of consolidated revenue for 2021 and were highly profitable. Due to the unusual circumstances under which the divestiture was made, there were essentially no proceeds from the transfer. As a result of this one-off event, we are unable to replace the lost earnings through reinvestment of proceeds.\nWith the transaction complete, we believe it's now appropriate to revise the starting and ending points of our long-term guidance to reflect the divestiture of WTW's Russian operations, just as we would any other significant transaction. I want to make it very clear that despite revising our long-term targets, we remain committed to delivering the same level of improvement, mid-single-digit, organic revenue growth and 400 to 500 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion as we set out at Investor Day.\nPage 4 of the earnings release published earlier this morning provides further disclosure on the divestiture and the related adjustments to our long-term guidance. Please note that our initial and revised targets exclude the potential effects of fluctuations in foreign currency rates.\nThe ongoing situation in Russia is a stark reminder of the heightened geopolitical and macroeconomic risk all basis is face today. I want to take a moment to talk about how we're helping our clients navigate this complicated and uncertain landscape. Our solutions help clients manage their human, physical and financial capital to protect and strengthen their institutions, and these tools only become more valuable in challenging times.\nInflation is top of mind. Our clients are increasingly seeking our advice and solutions to manage the impact of inflation on wages, health care costs, pensions and retirement plans. With tight labor markets persisting, solving these challenges is a strategic opportunity for clients, and we're helping them optimize total rewards spend, manage the cost of retirement and medical programs and efficiently fund and finance programs via pooling, global underwriting, captive strategies and delegated asset management.\nAnother hallmark of the current environment is how quickly it's changing. In addition to working with our clients to manage traditional ever-present risks, we're seeing strong demand from clients for innovative solutions and tools to help them identify, quantify and manage fast-moving risks such as more volatile financial markets, climate change, geopolitical tensions, heightened ESG risk and reputational damage to name a few. We're rising to this challenge by bringing the best of our organization together globally, creating market-leading analytical tools to help clients make better informed decisions and crafting customized solutions to meet our clients' emergent risks.\nOur performance in the quarter demonstrated our focus on delivering on our commitments and our pursuit of profitable sustainable growth. We believe that the successful execution of our strategy and robust client demand in the face of a very complex risk environment will keep us on track to achieve our guidance for 2022. We continue to build momentum and remain focused on the (inaudible) goals to create shareholder value.\nIn closing, I want to thank our colleagues for their performance this quarter. We are truly appreciative of their dedication, service and continued commitment to our vision. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Andrew.\n\nAndrew Jay Krasner\n\nCFO, Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company\n\nThanks, Carl. Good morning, everyone. Thanks to all of you for joining us today. As Carl mentioned, our clients are grappling with a host of macroeconomic and geopolitical challenges. Unfortunately, they have also continued to grapple with rising commercial insurance rates. While price increases appear to be moderating, WTW's Q2 commercial lines insurance pricing survey showed an aggregate increase of just below 6%. Data for nearly all lines continue to indicate significant price increases with the exception of works compensation and D&O liability. The largest price increase came from cyber followed by professional liability.\nIn light of these additional pressure points, we continue to focus on helping clients evaluate their options so they can make better informed decisions about how to best manage their risk portfolios.\nTurning to our financial results. The third quarter was in line with our expectations. On an organic basis, revenue was up 6%, reflecting accelerating growth across all of our businesses. Adjusted operating income was $284 million or 14.5% of revenue for the quarter, up 110 basis points from $264 million or 13.4% of revenue in the same period last year as our growth and expense discipline combined to enhance our profitability. The net result was adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.20, representing 27% growth over the prior year.\nLet's turn to our detailed segment results. Note that to provide comparability with prior periods, all commentary regarding the results of our segments will be on an organic basis, unless specifically stated otherwise. The Health, Wealth and Career or HWC segment generated revenue growth of 4% are both in organic and constant currency basis compared to the third quarter of last year. Health, which is comprised of our Health and Benefits broking and consulting business delivered growth of 6%, primarily driven by increased demand for products and advisory work in North America spurred by clients focus on mitigating likely 2023 cost increases and by U.S. legislative changes. Revenue also grew outside of North America as a result of new client appointments and increases in health care premiums.\nWealth, which consists of our retirement and investment businesses grew 3% in the quarter. The growth was primarily attributable to higher levels of regulatory and project work in Europe as well as increased consulting work in North America. The growth was partially offset by a nominal decrease in our delegated investment solutions business, which was pressured by declines in capital markets. While we expect the headwind from these declines to persist into the fourth quarter, we see momentum in building in the rest of the Wealth business during the remainder of the year, driven by new client acquisition and strong demand for specialist work in response to market volatility and legislative changes.\nCareer, which includes our Work & Rewards and Employee Experience businesses also contributed to revenue growth for the segment, increasing 6% in the quarter. This growth was largely driven by strong client demand for talent and compensation products, including compensation benchmarking surveys, hiring assessments and employee engagement offerings, which we see continuing.\nBenefits Delivery and Outsourcing, which encompasses our Benefits Delivery and Administration and our Technology and Administrative Solutions businesses generated 2% revenue growth over the third quarter of 2021. The increase was largely driven by individual marketplace and reflected growth in Medicare Advantage revenue in our direct-to-consumer business. Outsourcing revenue also increased due to new client appointments and growth across the existing client base. We continue to see an environment that supports growth opportunities for this business for the remainder of 2022 and beyond.\nHWC's operating margin was 20.3% this quarter compared to 20.6% in the prior period. The margin declined primarily to investments in resourcing and technology to support future revenue growth.\nAs economic uncertainty looms and market volatility persists, companies are dealing with high inflation rates, workplace stress caused by labor shortages as well as cost and risk management concerns related to pensions and health benefits. Against this challenging backdrop, HWC is helping companies better address employees' needs while managing business realities. Our near and long-term outlook for HWC remains positive as we expect its market-leading solutions and the ongoing demand drivers in its core businesses to continue to support organic growth.\nRisk and Broking revenue was up 6% on an organic basis and 3% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year third quarter. Corporate Risk and Broking or CRB, revenue increased 6%. The business generated growth across all regions, primarily from new business with double-digit growth across most of our global lines of business. Book of business settlement activity was due to senior colleague departures in 2021 and is consistent with the levels seen in the prior year period. Thus, it did not affect CRB's year-over-year organic growth rate.\nBoth Europe and International led CRB's growth with improved client retention and notably strong new business in natural resources, construction and aerospace. Solid growth in North America was driven by strong contributions from both construction and M&A solutions.\nIn the Insurance Consulting and Technology business, revenue was up 2% on top of a tough comparable of 18% growth in the prior year third quarter, primarily driven by increased Technology Solutions sales. On a year-to-date basis, ICT has delivered strong growth. It's trajectory continues to point towards a strong finish in the fourth quarter.\nR&B's operating margin was 13.7% for the third quarter compared to 17.5% in the prior year third quarter. Margin headwinds were driven by our significant investments in new revenue-producing and client service talent. Throughout this year, R&B welcomed new leaders and senior contributors across all geographies at both the regional and country level. Leveraging their industry expertise, these key hires have begun to contribute to our performance and we expect these contributions will become more meaningful going forward. The steady improvement in our talent base and client pipeline has strengthened our conviction that the work we have done to rebuild our talent base is gaining traction and will yield strong results.\nNow let's turn to the enterprise level results. In Q3, we generated profitable growth with adjusted operating margin increasing 110 basis points to 14.5% from 13.4% in the prior year, primarily reflecting the benefits of strategic portfolio management which was realized at the corporate level, alongside transformation program savings, which were realized at the segment level, but were more than offset by our increased investment in talent during the period.\nWe continue to expect margin improvement each year as we work to deliver on our 2024 margin goal. As Carl mentioned, our transformation initiatives will be a key contributor to this ongoing margin expansion, and we're encouraged by the success of our early efforts. By accelerating shared services and our workforce centralization efforts, in addition to identifying incremental opportunities to drive collaboration through real estate portfolio optimization, we have far surpassed our original $30 million annualized run rate savings goal for the year. As a result, we raised both our near and long-term targets and now expect to deliver approximately $110 million in cumulative run rate savings by the end of 2022 and $360 million by the end of 2024.\nForeign currency was a headwind on adjusted EPS of $0.20 through the first 9 months of the year, largely due to the strength of the U.S. dollar. Assuming today's rates continue for the remainder of the year, we've updated our guidance related to our expected foreign currency headwind on adjusted earnings per share from a range of $0.20 to $0.25 to a range of approximately $0.25 to $0.30. We generated free cash flow of $337 million for the first 9 months of 2022 compared to free cash flow of $1.8 billion in the prior year. This decrease was primarily due to the receipt of the $1 billion termination fee in the comparable period, the absence of cash generation from the now divested Willis Re business and additional tax payments made this year on both the Willis Re, gain on sale and the termination fee.\nOur U.S. GAAP tax rate for the third quarter was 0.7% versus 22.5% in the prior year. Our adjusted tax rate for the third quarter was 16.8% versus 23.2% in the prior year. The current year adjusted tax rate is lower primarily due to lower U.S. fee expense and excess tax benefit on share-based compensation. We expect the full year 2022 adjusted tax rate to be relatively consistent with our historical rates.\nWe continue to pursue a disciplined capital allocation strategy that balances capital return to shareholders with internal investments and strategic M&A to deploy our capital on the highest return opportunities. During the third quarter of 2022, we paid $91 million in dividends and repurchased 1.8 million shares for $369 million.\nWe are pleased by our progress with business performance ramping as we expected. For the remainder of the year, we see macroeconomic environment that is creating demand for our services and opportunities to help clients with our unique combination of solutions. We feel positive about the investments we have made in talent, innovation and operational transformation and are confident these investments will continue to drive organic revenue growth and margin expansion.\nWith that, let's open it up for Q&A."

Please go ahead, sir.\n\nCarl A. Hess\n\nHead of Investment, Risk & Reinsurance, Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company\n\nGood morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for WTW's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Earnings Call. Joining me today is Andrew Krasner, our Chief Financial Officer.\nWTW ended 2023 on a strong note and has begun 2024 with solid momentum as we continue to execute on our grow, simplify and transform strategic priorities. In the fourth quarter, our world-class solutions and maturing investments in talent helped generate robust organic revenue growth.\nAnd our transformation program and expense discipline drove adjusted operating margin expansion and solid adjusted diluted earnings per share growth. Our performance steadily improved throughout 2023. And today, WTW is stronger, more resilient and better positioned to achieve our goals.\nWe delivered 6% organic revenue growth in the fourth quarter with an adjusted operating margin of 34.2%, up 180 basis points over the prior year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $7.44, an 18% increase year-over-year.\nFor the full year, we had organic revenue growth of 8% above our mid-single-digit target. We also drove 110 basis points of year-over-year margin expansion to achieve an adjusted operating margin of 22%, fulfilling our commitment of annual margin expansion. Our adjusted diluted earnings per share were $14.49, an 8% increase over the prior year.\nWe believe these results are the product of our strong global client model, our strategic investments in talent and technology and our team's hard work and relentless focus on best-in-class delivery.\nThe progress we see within WTW and the enthusiastic response we're receiving from clients give us confidence that our strategies, our people and our investments are aligned with areas that we believe to be the greatest opportunities to drive sustainable profitable growth and create shareholder value over the long term.\nLet me take a few minutes to share the progress we've made and the opportunities ahead of us across our segments. Throughout 2023, our specialization strategy in Risk & Broking was a key driver of growth for both the segment and the enterprise. Our specialty businesses continue to have significantly higher growth in the rest of the segment. This growth, driven in large part by improved client retention, expansion of existing client relationships and our strength and ability to attract new clients and win back old ones has validated our approach.\nAs a result, specialization continues to be our primary strategic focus in R&B. It allows us to create value for clients by tailoring solutions that close gaps in their risk management profile. Together with digitization, data and analytics, we can create efficiencies that enable us to provide more timely and effective insurance services.\nOur approach to specialization is tailored to each geography in which we operate. In 2023, we built out 12 industry verticals in North America. That process is now complete, with colleagues, processes and infrastructure supporting that alignment. Given the success we've seen to date, we're in the process of launching this industry model across Western Europe, and we'll build out more industry verticals in our international region in 2024.\nThis model, together with our global reach, has us positioned to win an outsized share of complex mandates such as our recent win of a multiyear construction project for a key player in the European energy sector. Our cutting-edge data and analytics and our ability to bring together superior industry and product expertise from our specialist teams across several countries set our proposal apart.\nWe're also making good progress expanding into new and differentiated revenue streams such as our new managing general underwriter, Verita, which is growing steadily since its initial launch in September.\nJust in the fourth quarter of 2023, we've onboarded brokers, [ balanced ] premiums and received submissions for both external and our own brokerage clients.\nIn 2024, we'll focus on expanding our MGA and MGU strategy to additional geographies. In addition to expanding our business platforms and offerings at Risk & Broking, we're continuing to invest in our people to win new business. Our colleagues who joined us during 2022 and 2023 have become increasingly productive and have brought our talent base back to full strength, as evidenced by the segment's strong organic revenue growth in the second half of 2023.\nAccordingly, we're now focused on strategic and opportunistic talent investments. These investments should enhance our presence capabilities in the lines of business and geographies that we believe offer the greatest growth and profitability potential. We expect these efforts to continue throughout 2024 and beyond.\nFurthermore, we see opportunity for continued strong new business growth as we work closely to help clients manage a complex and challenging risk environment marked by increasingly costly natural disasters, social inflation and geopolitical conflicts.\nIn HWC, we've leveraged the strength of our portfolio, driving growth through and across health, wealth and career and BD&O. We've made significant progress by staying focused on our core businesses by making connections across the organization where it adds value for clients and by simplifying how we work. For example, we maintained or improved client retention rates across all of HWC, including excellent 98% retention rates for our retirement and outsourcing businesses.\nWe had a dozen of clients for our signature packaged solutions like our LifeSight master trust and global benefits management offerings. We expanded our relationships with more than 1,500 clients to include at least one new service offering. And we increased the size and scope of our hub teams in key centers around the world to enhance capacity and consistency.\nOur intense focus on cross-selling and making it simpler to do business with us is paying off. Across industries and services, more clients are coming to WTW for a full suite of solutions. Just to mention a few from this quarter. We had a software development firm move its global benefits consulting and brokerage work to WTW and appoint us to support their employee experience through our Embark portal and our Engage software.\nA major global financial corporation's simple survey request turned into a multiyear engagement for us that includes supporting the client with attracting and pertaining talent and the delivery of a fully integrated total reward solution using one of our portals. And we leveraged our existing pension actuarial and outsourcing relationships with a leading regional health system into support for a rollout of major changes to their health and benefits program, which include the creation of a temporary health and welfare service center.\nWe're confident HWC will provide a solid foundation for growth in 2024. And as we've discussed on prior calls, complexity in the human capital landscape continues to increase and finding the right solutions to our clients' unique needs in this environment requires a holistic, integrated and consultative approach. Our ability to move quickly and deliver the right resources at speed helps our clients take advantage of changing conditions and creates meaningful opportunities for HWC.\nI'll highlight 2 trends we see as tailwinds for 2024. In our health business, clients are continuing to look for ways to address the increasing cost of health care around the world. They're to us for help with more effective plan management and specialty solutions that can improve their population health status. And in our retirement business, clients are increasingly looking to capitalize on the change in the rate environment by derisking their pension plans through annuity buy-ins and buyouts.\nWith the funded status of the largest U.S. corporate pension plans having ended 2023 at 100%, we expect this trend will support growth in that business during 2024.\nWe also expect our growing momentum with smart connections this quarter to continue into 2024 and also extends to cross-selling between our 2 segments. We continue to arm all our colleagues with a solid understanding of our full range of services and the tools to identify and facilitate cross-segment opportunities.\nTwo large client wins in the fourth quarter illustrate the power of this approach, a P&C insurance solution is a major media company that originated with one of our retirement colleagues and a multiyear health benefits design, administration and broking engagement that began with a benefits review arranged by a CRB column. The progress we've made in enhancing our growth engines at HWC and R&B over the past 2-plus years is also enabling us to drive increased margin expansion.\nDuring the fourth quarter, we saw a continuing improvement in productivity and a tightened focus on cost discipline. Similarly, our transformation program continues to drive a significant benefit to our bottom line, enabling us to finish the year strong and to lay the foundation for another year of adjusted operating margin expansion.\nWe realized $37 million of incremental annualized savings from our transformation program during the fourth quarter, bringing the total to $337 million in cumulative annualized savings since the program's inception. Thanks to the success and momentum of the program, we have been able to identify additional savings and accordingly, are raising our cumulative run rate transformation savings target from $380 million to $425 million by the end of 2024.\nLooking ahead, we're confident that we're on the right path to achieve our 2024 targets of continued mid-single-digit organic revenue growth leading to at least $9.9 billion in total revenue, adjusted operating margins of 22.5% to 23.5%, adjusted diluted earnings per share of $15.40 to $17 and additional improvement in our free cash flow margin. Andrew will touch on our 2024 guidance in more detail shortly.\nIn closing, our performance in 2023 reflected our hard work to grow, simplify and transform our business over the past 2-plus years. I'm proud of the progress we've made and excited about the opportunities ahead. Based on our momentum and our healthy pipeline, I'm confident we can deliver continued sustainable and profitable growth in 2024 and beyond. I want to thank our colleagues for their dedication, service and continued commitment to our clients and to WTW.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Andrew.\n\nAndrew Krasner\n\nThanks, Carl. Good morning, and thanks for joining us today. As Carl mentioned, we finished the year with strong momentum, putting us in a solid position to achieve our 2024 targets, and I'd like to share some further details on our financial results.\nWe delivered organic revenue growth of 6% in the fourth quarter, bringing the full year growth rate to 8%. The ramp-up in productivity of our investment hires, our specialization strategy and Risk & Broking and the ongoing demand for our benefits and human capital services in HWC continue to fuel the strong top line growth. Alongside this robust growth, we also drove margin expansion for both the quarter and full year at the enterprise level and in each of our segments. The result was adjusted diluted earnings per share of $7.44 for the quarter and $40.49 for the year.\nNext, I'll spend some time reviewing our segment results. Note that to provide comparability with prior periods, all commentary regarding the results of our segments will be on an organic basis, unless specifically stated otherwise. Health, Wealth & Career generated revenue growth of 4% compared to the fourth quarter of last year and finished the year with 6% growth.\nGoing into 2024, we feel confident in the outlook and expect another year of similarly positive results for the segment. Revenue for health increased 6% for the quarter or 5% when excluding the impact of some modest book of business activity. We delivered solid growth across all regions driven by increased brokerage income and the continued expansion of our global benefits management client portfolio in Europe and international. Wealth grew 5% in the fourth quarter. Retirement growth was driven by increased project work related to derisking activity in North America as well as additional project work in the pension brokerage in Europe.\nInvestments also contributed significantly to growth for the quarter, reflecting new client acquisitions and higher fees. Career delivered 6% growth in the quarter, driven by increased compensation survey sales, executive compensation and Board advisory services and project work related to employee experience. Benefits Delivery & Outsourcing generated 3% growth in the quarter. The increase was be driven by higher volumes and placements of Medicare Advantage and life policies in our individual marketplace business and increased project activity and benefits outsourcing.\nHWC's operating margin increased 150 basis points compared to the prior fourth quarter to 40.5%, primarily driven by transformation savings. For the full year, HWC's operating margin increased 190 basis points over prior year to 28%. Risk & Broking revenue was up an exceptional 12% on an organic basis for the fourth quarter.\nInterest income was $27 million for the quarter, up $17 million from the fourth quarter last year. Note that beginning with Q1 2024 results, we plan to include the impact of investment income on organic growth at the segment and enterprise levels in our materials.\nFor the full year, Risk & Broking grew 10% organically. We are expecting mid-single digit or better organic revenue growth for the segment in 2024, with continued contributions from our investments in talent and platforms as we identify and pursue opportunities in line with our specialization strategy.\nCorporate Risk & Broking had another strong quarter, growing 12% and continuing the organic revenue growth trajectory we have seen in the business over the last couple of quarters. Higher levels of new business activity, improved client retention and increased renewable revenue from rate increases drove robust organic revenue growth.\nOur specialty lines continue to be major contributors to the strong growth performance, led globally by natural resources, facultative, ‘FINEX’ Financial Solutions, crisis management and construction. Strong growth across CRB in Europe was led by P&C retail, facultative, Natural Resources and FINEX. North America CRB benefited from strong new business in construction, Natural Resources, marine, aerospace, real estate and hospitality and leisure as we saw strong demand in the industries in which we specialize.\nOur international region also contributed with exceptional organic growth, including strong growth across all subregions led by Latin America. In the Insurance Consulting and Technology business, revenue was up 8% over the prior year period on top of a strong comparable, driven by increased sales in Technology Solutions, including strong new business and higher project activity. R&B's operating margin was 32.9% for the fourth quarter, a 460 basis point increase over the prior year fourth quarter.\nWe continue to see our hiring efforts yield strong results and rising productivity, driving greater operating leverage. The margin also benefited from transformation, continued expense discipline and tailwinds from increased interest income, partially offset by some modest foreign exchange activity and investments in people and technology platforms.\nFor the full year, R&B's operating margin increased 60 basis points over prior year to 21.8%. As Carl mentioned, we plan to continue to opportunistically invest in talent and strategic initiatives in this segment in line with our previous announcement.\nFor 2024, we continue to expect margin expansion on a full year basis. Given the business seasonality and uncertain pacing of the investments, please note that the scale of R&B margin expansion may vary from quarter-to-quarter. At the enterprise level, adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 34.2%, a 180 basis point increase over prior year. For the full year, we saw 110 basis points of margin improvement to 22%.\nThe benefits of our transformation program drove a large part of our margin expansion for the year. We had $37 million of incremental annualized transformation savings for the fourth quarter, bringing the total of $337 million since the program's inception.\nAs Carl mentioned, we are raising our transformation savings target to $425 million by the end of 2024. The additional savings will primarily come from technology modernization and process optimization which we expect to further reduce our cost structure and help unlock additional long-term growth and cost savings opportunities.\nThe total amount of cost to achieve is now estimated at $1.125 billion. Along with their direct return on investment, these additions to the transformation program will serve as a catalyst for additional improvement by creating an infrastructure from which to drive further efficiencies.\nOur unallocated net was $296 million for the full year 2023, an increase of $31 million over prior year, primarily due to a headwind from a onetime favorable item reflected in the prior year balance. Foreign exchange was a $0.02 tailwind on adjusted EPS for the quarter and a $0.06 headwind for the year. At current spot rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a $0.02 headwind on adjusted EPS for 2024 with no impact in Q1.\nWe recorded $109 million in pension income for 2023, relatively in line with our expectations. For 2024, we expect $88 million in pension income with the decrease driven by market performance and interest rate movements.\nOur U.S. GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 15.7% versus 17.7% in the prior year. Our adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 19.1% compared to 22.2% for the fourth quarter of 2022. Our U.S. GAAP tax rate for the year was 16.8% versus 15.4% in the prior year. And lastly, our adjusted tax rate for the year was 20.9%, consistent with prior year.\nNotably, there were nonrecurring items in Q4, which resulted in onetime tax items in our 2023 adjusted tax rate. Excluding these benefits, our adjusted tax rate would have been 22.4%, and our adjusted diluted EPS would have been $14.22. We expect our full year adjusted tax rate in 2024 to be closer to our 2023 adjusted tax rate, excluding these onetime benefits.\nIn 2023, we returned nearly $1.4 billion to our shareholders with share repurchases of $1 billion and dividends of $352 million. We continue to execute a disciplined capital allocation strategy and currently view share repurchases as an attractive use of capital to create long-term shareholder value. We expect to continue repurchasing our shares in 2024 under our current share repurchase authority of which approximately $1.3 billion remains. We expect approximately $750 million of share repurchases in 2024, subject to market conditions, among other relevant factors.\nWe generated free cash flow of $1.2 billion in 2023, representing a free cash flow margin of 12.6%, above our target of 12%. The improvement from the prior year was driven by the nonrecurrence of onetime headwinds reflected in the comparable period, operating margin expansion and improvement in TRANZACT's cash flow. These improvements were partially offset by increased transformation program-related costs.\nTurning to our 2024 financial targets. We continue to expect mid-single-digit organic revenue growth as we work towards our revenue goal of $9.9 billion-plus. We expect our adjusted operating margin to expand toward the high end of the 22.5% to 23.5% range. We also expect to deliver on our adjusted diluted earnings per share target of $15.40 to $17. Finally, we expect incremental improvement in our free cash flow margin.\nOur results for the fourth quarter and full year 2023 are a testament to our continued strategic progress, our operational execution and our colleagues' relentless focus on serving our clients. We are very pleased with our performance and expect our momentum to continue into 2024 as we focus on delivering on our targets.\nWith that, let's open it up for Q&A."

Please go ahead.\n\nCarl A. Hess\n\nCEO & Director, Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company\n\nGood morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for WTW Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. Joining me today is Andrew Krasner, our Chief Financial Officer. In the second quarter, WTW delivered results that as expected, built off the solid start we had to our year. We generated organic revenue growth of 3% and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.32 as we continue to make progress on our strategic initiatives. Our transformation program, continued expense discipline and operating leverage from new business generation drove 30 basis points of adjusted operating margin despite headwinds from our growth investments.\nWe also continued to execute against our capital allocation strategy and completed $471 million in share repurchases in the second quarter, bringing total share repurchases for 2022 to $2.7 billion. Overall, we're pleased with our second quarter performance and remain confident in our ability to deliver against our financial goals in both 2022 and the longer term. This confidence comes from our ongoing execution against our strategy to grow, simplify and transform as well as our continued progress in rebuilding our talent and ramping our productivity. Through the first half of the year, we've already seen top line benefits from our investments in talent, and we expect that benefit to meaningfully accelerate in the second half of the year.\nI'm particularly pleased with the results of our transformation initiatives. We realized $35 million of incremental annualized savings during the second quarter, bringing the total to $71 million cumulative since the program's inception will more than double our original $30 million target for 2022. Accordingly, we're raising our guidance on cumulative run rate transformation savings identified by the end of 2022 from $30 million to over $80 million.\nIt's important to note that this increase is not simply pulling forward savings previously included in our $300 million medium-term target. Our focus on continuous improvement has helped us identify both areas in which we could accelerate progress as well as new opportunities and incremental sources of value.\nAs a result, we now expect the program to generate annual cost savings in excess of $300 million by the end of 2024.\nIn the second quarter, we also made progress on our grow initiatives, bringing to bear the full capabilities of 1 WTW for our clients through both new and existing solutions. Our strategic focus on scaling our global lines of business and Corporate Risk & Broking is gaining traction in the market with growth in these lines exceeding the CRB average by 50%. We also maintained a steady pace of new product launches, focusing on high-growth, high-need markets such as ESG analytics and climate risk. In April, we launched our ESG analytics program at the U.S. RIMS Conference. It's already generating early results by simplifying our client outreach and solving ESG data analytics and reporting needs for clients and has been part of 7-figure wins in 2 pilot markets in 2022.\nWe believe this solution has the potential to scale further in multiple markets around the world and we're building a world-class suite of climate risk management tools and solutions under our climate quantified banner. Following our development of the climate transition pathways of accreditation framework and the launch of our climate transition index with stocks in 2021.\nThis year, we introduced our climate transition value at risk data and software for asset managers and asset owners. Earlier this month, we announced the acquisition of 1 of our longtime climate analytics and software partners, further enhancing our technical capabilities. Our investments in this area are positioning us to be a global leader in helping organizations and manage climate transition risk. While new products are important, our approach to everyday innovation is also supporting our growth priority as we nimbly respond to legislative and other environmental changes.\nAs suggested by the everyday label, there's lots happening in this area. So I'll share just 1 to give you an idea. In response to the U.S. health care, No Surprises Act, we quickly developed and introduced transparency bundles, a cost-effective communication solution that supports clients in meeting their compliance obligations and is easily sold as an add-on to our existing clients.\nLastly, together with our strategic growth initiatives, our intense focus on onboarding talent has built a strong foundation for revenue growth in the second half of 2022 and beyond. The pace of hiring in the second quarter matched that of the first quarter, and our new hires in sales and client management roles doubled compared to the second quarter last year. We also continued to see the benefit of retention efforts with voluntary attrition at reasonable levels and aligned with macro trends.\nIn sum, we've been hard at work this quarter, changing the way we operate in creating a leaner, more innovative and more agile WTW. I'm confident that as these initiatives mature, they will improve our long-term financial performance as we expect them to deliver significant shareholder returns. Before I hand it over to Andrew to discuss our financial results, I want to take a moment to talk about the resilience of our business in the face of dynamic and challenging economic conditions.\nWe believe WTW is well positioned to weather macroeconomic uncertainty, including both inflation and potential recession. Our portfolio of businesses is relatively noncyclical, we estimate that about 80% of our revenue base is recurring, often built upon nondiscretionary solutions and services. In addition, our clients span a variety of industries and geographies and our solutions tend to increase importance and value in complex economic environments. For these reasons, our business is less sensitive to economic downturns than companies in some other industries. As an example, in 2020, when U.S. GDP declined by 2%, we still posted organic revenue growth of 2%.\nSimilarly, if you looked at our predecessor company's results from the 2008, 2009 economic downturn, you'd see that they continue to grow organic revenues by 2% to 4%. That said, we do have some exposure in economically sensitive lines of business, where the work we do is discretionary in nature, primarily in our Health, Wealth and Career segment, but we would expect the impact of that exposure and recession to be relatively low. Overall, our performance in the quarter was aligned with our expectations and reflected our commitment to profitable growth and the successful execution of our strategy. We continue to build momentum and remain focused on delivering on our long-term goals.\nIn closing, I want to express my gratitude to my incredible team of colleagues who live our values and have delivered every day for our clients in a volatile and challenging environment. With our sharpened focus, we are well positioned to continue driving growth and executing on our transformation.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Andrew for more detail on our results.\n\nAndrew Jay Krasner\n\nCFO, Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company\n\nThanks, Carl. Good morning, everyone. Thanks to all of you for joining us today. Before turning to our results, let me take a minute to expand on Carl's comments about WTW's ability to navigate difficult economic conditions. With interest rate spiking and equities exceptionally volatile in the second quarter, we believe the market is clearly signaling concerns about the near-term future of the economy and corporate profits. As Carl mentioned, during the previous economic downturns, WTW continued to thrive and grow revenues. We have also repeatedly demonstrated our resilient cost structure, which has allowed the business to maintain its earnings power during challenging economic times. Despite inflationary pressure on labor costs and the post-pandemic normalizing of variable costs such as travel, we remain steadfast in exercising financial discipline, and our outlook on near-term and long-term margin expansion remains unchanged.\nTurning to our financial results. The second quarter was aligned with our expectations. On an organic basis, revenue was up 3%, reflecting growth across most of our businesses. Adjusted operating income was $314 million or 15.5% of revenue for the quarter up 30 basis points from $318 million or 15.2% of revenue in the same period last year as our growth and expense discipline combined to enhance our profitability. The net result was adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.32, representing 9% growth over the prior year.\nLet's turn to our detailed segment results. Note that to provide clear comparability with prior periods, all commentary regarding the results of our segments will be on an organic basis, unless specifically stated otherwise. The Health, Wealth and Career or HWC segment generated revenue growth of 2% on both an organic and constant currency basis compared to the second quarter of the prior year. Health, which is comprised of our Health and Benefits broking and consulting business, delivered growth of 8%. This includes a gain recorded in connection with book of business settlements related to senior staff departures that occurred in 2021. Excluding the book of business gain, Health's organic growth was 3%, primarily driven by new client appointments and further bolstered by project work.\nWealth, which consists of our retirement and investment businesses had a revenue decrease of 7% for the quarter. The decline was primarily due to a headwind from outsized performance fees that were recorded in the prior year quarter in our Investments business, as we've discussed previously. We expect to see significant improvement in the wealth businesses during the second half of the year driven by new client acquisition and strong market demand for specialist work in response to market volatility and legislative change.\nCareer, which includes our Work & Rewards and Employee Experience businesses also contributed to the revenue growth for the segment increasing 5% in the quarter. This growth was largely driven by strong client demand for advisory work, data products and software licenses.\nIn Benefits Delivery & Outsourcing, which encompasses our Benefits Delivery & Administration and our Technology and Administrative Solutions businesses, revenue increased 7% from the prior year second quarter. The increase was largely driven by individual marketplace and reflected growth in Medicare Advantage revenue in our direct-to-consumer business. Outsourcing revenue also grew with new client appointments and growth across the existing client base. We continue to see a macro environment that supports growth opportunities for this business in 2022.\nHWC's operating margin was 18.7% this quarter compared to 18.6% in the prior period. Excluding the impact of foreign currency and onetime fees from book of business gains and performance fees, the margin expanded 80 basis points, driven by strong operating leverage and in-year savings from our transformation program.\nOur near-term and long-term outlook for HWC remain positive as we expect its market-leading solutions and the ongoing demand drivers in its core businesses to continue to drive organic growth.\nLooking at Risk and Broking, revenue was up 3% on an organic basis and 1% on a constant currency basis as compared to the prior year second quarter. Excluding a modest headwind from book of business settlement activities, R&B's organic revenue increased 4%. Corporate Risk & Broking, or CRB, revenue increased 3%. Book of business settlement activity, which stemmed from senior colleague departures that occurred in 2021 declined nominally from the prior year but did not meaningfully affect CRB's year-over-year organic growth rate. The business generated growth across all regions, primarily from new business with notable strength in our M&A, Aerospace, Natural Resources and FINEX specialty lines. International led CRB's growth driven by growth in Natural Resources and Construction lines. Growth in North America and Europe came from both new business and improved client retention driven by the expansion of our teams in those regions and colleague retention rates at senior levels have continued to show improvement.\nIn the Insurance Consulting and Technology business, revenue was up 9% compared to the prior year second quarter, driven by increased technology solutions sales and higher demand for advisory work. R&B's operating margin was 19.7% for the second quarter compared to 23.1% in the prior year second quarter. The margin decline was driven by our significant investment in new revenue-producing and client service talent. In Q2, R&B welcomed new leaders across all geographies. These key hires will deliver their industry expertise and specialty insights to clients across the globe in lines such as Construction, Aerospace, FINEX, Natural Resources and Facultative. Seeing steady improvements in our client pipeline has strengthened our conviction that the work we have done to rebuild our talent base will yield strong results throughout the second half of the year. We believe these actions will enable us to significantly accelerate organic growth and meet our longer-term goal of mid-single-digit revenue growth for this business.\nNow let's turn to the enterprise level results. In Q2, we generated profitable growth with adjusted operating margins increasing 30 basis points to 15.5% from 15.2% in the prior year primarily reflecting improved operating leverage and our transformation initiatives, which more than offset our increased investments in talent during the period. We continue to expect margin improvement each year as we work to deliver in our 2024 margin goals.\nAs Carl mentioned, our transformation initiatives will be a key contributor to this ongoing margin expansion. Our early efforts in this area have been very successful. By accelerating shared services and workforce centralization efforts and identifying incremental opportunities to drive collaboration through real estate portfolio optimization we have far surpassed our $30 million annualized run-rate savings goal for the year. As a result, we raised both our near- and long-term targets.\nForeign currency with a headwind on adjusted EPS and of $0.17 through the first half of the year, largely due to the strength of the U.S. dollar against the euro. Assuming today's rates continue for the remainder of the year, we've updated our guidance related to our expected foreign currency headwind on adjusted earnings per share from a range of $0.15 to $0.20 to a range of approximately $0.20 to $0.25.\nWe generated free cash flow of $198 million for the first 6 months of 2022, an $89 million decrease from free cash flow of $287 million in the prior year. This decrease was due primarily to the absence of cash generation from the now divested Willis Re business as well as additional tax payments resulting from both the Willis Re sale and the deal termination fee received last year.\nWe continue to prioritize returning capital to shareholders and executed aggressively on this commitment. During the second quarter of 2022, we paid $91 million in dividends and repurchased 2.1 million shares for $471 million. Of that $471 million, $253 million was completed during May and June. We also raised our repurchase authorization by $1 billion to $6.5 billion, of which approximately $2.1 billion remains. We continue to be committed to deploying excess capital and free cash flow into our highest return opportunities and still believe that the return we can achieve from repurchasing shares remains highly attractive. Accordingly, we expect to continue to deploy free cash flow in this manner, subject to market conditions.\nOverall, we're off to a good start in 2022 with the performance of the business ramping as we expected it would. As we think about the rest of the year, we see macroeconomic challenges that will create demand for our services and opportunities to help clients. We continue to feel positive about the investments we have made in talent, innovation and operational transformation and are confident those investments will drive organic revenue growth and margin expansion we have forecast for the year and position us to achieve our 2024 goals.\nWith that, let's open it up for Q&A."

(Operator Instructions) With that, I will now hand it over to Justin Furby, Vice President of Investor Relations.\n\nJustin Allen Furby\n\nSenior Director of IR, Workday, Inc.\n\nThank you, operator. Welcome to Workday's Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2022 Earnings Conference Call. On the call, we have Aneel Bhusri and Chano Fernandez, our Co-CEOs; Barbara Larson, our CFO; and Pete Schlampp, our Chief Strategy Officer. Following prepared remarks, we will take questions. Our press release was issued after close of market and is posted on our website, where this call is being simultaneously webcast.\nBefore we get started, we want to emphasize that some of our statements on this call, particularly our guidance, are based on the information we have as of today and include forward-looking statements regarding our financial results, applications, customer demand, operations and other matters. These statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including those related to the impacts of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on our business and global economic conditions. Please refer to the press release and the risk factors and documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our 2022 annual report on Form 10-K for additional information on risks, uncertainties and assumptions that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in such statements.\nIn addition, during today's call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are useful as supplemental measures of Workday's performance. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to and not as a substitute for or in isolation from GAAP results. You can find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations with comparable GAAP results, in our earnings press release and on the Investor Relations page of our website.\nThe webcast replay of this call will be available for the next 90 days on our company website under the Investor Relations link. Also, the customers' page of our website includes a list of selected customers and is updated monthly.\nOur first quarter fiscal 2023 quiet period begins on April 16, 2022. Unless otherwise stated, all financial comparisons in this call will be to our results for the comparable period of our fiscal 2021.\nWith that, I will hand the call over to Aneel.\n\nAneel Bhusri\n\nCo-Founder, Co-CEO & Chairman of the Board, Workday, Inc.\n\nThank you, Justin, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today for our fourth quarter fiscal year '22 earnings call.\nBefore we begin, I want to spend a moment acknowledging the current situation in the Ukraine. Our thoughts are with all of those who are personally impacted by the devastating situation, including Workday contractors in Ukraine, Workmates across the western region in Europe and families of military personnel who have been deployed in the region.\nTurning now to our business results. I'm pleased to report that Workday delivered an exceptional fourth quarter, which helped us achieve the fastest growth in full year new ACV bookings in over 5 years. This acceleration in our business, along with our relentless focus on employees, customers and innovation, is serving as a strong foundation for driving durable growth on our path to $10 billion in revenues and beyond. Our business success is enabling us to attract talent at a pace we have never seen before and is allowing us to continue to expand and support new customers across our broad suite of solutions aimed at the CHRO and CFO. Indeed, we now serve more than 60 million total users across 9,500 organizations, including more than 4,100 core HCM and finance customers.\nAs our customer community continues to expand, so does our opportunity to serve them in more strategic ways. As Chano will soon share, we closed several significant transactions within our customer base sales team in Q4. Our continued commitment to our customer success is also reflected in our industry-leading gross retention rate of over 95%. Additionally, we are seeing customers increase their engagement and usage of our applications as evidenced by the over 440 billion transactions processed within Workday in fiscal year 2022, which is an increase of 67% over the previous year. Altogether, we now work with over 50% of the Fortune 500 and over 25% of the Global 2000.\nBefore I turn it over to Chano, who will share more on our go-to-market success; and Barbara Larson, our new CFO, who will provide specifics on our rate growth outlook for fiscal year '23, I'd like to share some fourth quarter highlights. First, momentum for our human capital management suite remains strong as organizations continue to transition their HR operations to the cloud. In Q4, we saw a healthy demand across all HCM product areas driven by our ability to attract new customers while strengthening and deepening our relationships with existing ones.\nNew customers in Q4 included Allied Financial, DICK'S Sporting Goods, National Australia Bank Limited, RiteAid Corporation, Smith Hill Foods and 7-Eleven, to name a few. Notable HCM go-lives in Q4 included Evonik Industries, Anheuser-Busch InBev and Wells Fargo Bank as we continue to have over 70% of our HCM customers in production.\nSwitching over to our financial management applications. Q4 was another solid quarter with several marquee wins, including Genpact Limited, Mass General Brigham, University of Melbourne and U.S. Bank. During the quarter, we doubled the number of add-on core financial management wins when compared to the same period a year ago and had several customers go live, including Bright Horizons Children Centers, Sharp Healthcare and SS&C Technologies.\nIn addition to the strong growth from our core finance application, we saw continued momentum from our expanding suite of products that support the office of the CFO, including planning, analytics and spend management, where our Strategic Sourcing solution experienced roughly 50% new ACV growth. And our procure-to-pay solution grew even faster. We continue to see very healthy attach rates for spend management solutions within our financial customers, illustrating health finances increasingly partnering with their procurement peers, drive visibility and bottom line impact for the single solution.\nAs we head into fiscal year '23, we are confident in the opportunity we have in front of us and our ability to execute on our growth initiatives on our path to $10 billion in revenues. As such, we expect fiscal year '23 to be another strong year for us.\nLastly, I'd like to share a couple of updates related to Workday's Board of Directors. First, Tom Bogan, who most recently served as Vice Chairman of Corporate Development, retired from Workday on January 31. And while we're excited for Tom and his well-deserved retirement, we are thrilled to announce that he has joined our Board. Tom came to Workday in 2018 as part of the Adaptive Insights acquisition, a company he led as CEO for nearly 4 years. During his time at Workday, Tom has been a trusted adviser, a true culture champion and passionate leader who embodies Workday's values. We are fortunate that he will now lend his expertise and guidance to help us capitalize on new opportunities for the business and work to accelerate future growth.\nThe second update I want to share is that Dave Duffield, my mentor, best friend and Workday's Co-Founder and former CEO and Chairman, has stepped down from our Board of Directors. I will now carry the honorary title of CEO Emeritus. While Dave will no longer be on the board, he remains our largest shareholder and will continue to provide his invaluable counsel as an adviser of Workday.\nWhen Dave and I started Workday nearly 17 years ago, our goal was to build a lasting multigenerational company with employees at the center and relentless focus on customer service and innovation. We wanted to have fun along the way. The growth we've experienced this past year in the face of a challenging macro environment has only solidified my belief in the foundation that we have built, thanks to the amazing group of employees and leaders who embraces our values and are committed to delivering the industry's best products and customer experience. I will end by saying that I'm quite optimistic about our future.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to our co-CEO, Chano Fernandez. Over to you, Chano.\n\nLuciano Fernandez Gomez\n\nCo-CEO & Director, Workday, Inc.\n\nThank you, Aneel, and thank you to everyone for joining today. I want to start off by acknowledging the more than 15,200 Workmates across the globe who helped drive our incredibly strong finish to the year. Amazing job. I can't wait to see what we accomplish together in FY '23. I'm also looking forward to safely spending time with many of you this week at our sales kickoff here in Las Vegas, where we are taking great care to follow the safety measures in accordance with the CDC and local authority guidelines.\nAs Aneel mentioned, we delivered an exceptional Q4 and growth reacceleration driven by a strong execution and healthy demand across solutions and regions. Our performance in North America was a standout, and we had another solid quarter internationally, where Asia Pacific markets such as Australia and New Zealand were a highlight, in addition to healthy growth in key EMEA market such as Germany.\nWe had a solid quarter of landing net new core HCM and FINS customers, including several Fortune 500 and Global 2000 companies, along with healthy activity in the medium enterprise. Our expanding portfolio of landing solutions also experienced significant momentum, including Peakon, Workday Strategic Sourcing and Planning where new customers included Tony's Healthcare, Plastic Omnium and At Home Stores. And we couldn't be more excited to add VNDLY to our portfolio of strategic landing solution. Even though it's early, we're already seeing the results with Q4 wins including RSM, Leonardo U.K. and Guild Mortgage, among others.\nIn addition to strength from our net new teams, our customer base sales teams drove outstanding performance across both add-on and renewals, once again demonstrating the strategic nature of our platform. Customer base expansions in Q4 included U.S. Bank who purchased core FINS, Accounting Center, Prism and Extend; FIS who purchased Workforce Planning, Extend and Canadian U.K. payroll; and Merck, BP, International and Autocat Aurora Health who all added Extend.\nIn Q4, we also expanded our relationship with Accenture, who is deploying Peakon to gain a real-time post on its employee base to help power its global talent strategy. As strategic partners of ours, Accenture is applying its innovation in this area to drive engagement and deep employee-related insights for our mutual customers.\nFrom an industry lens, we continue to see our differentiated value proposition winning in the market. In financial services, for example, we closed several strategic deals in Q4, including core FINS win at the aforementioned U.S. Bank, Junior Mutual and Pam Mutual Life Insurance; and core HCM wins at National Australia Bank, Allied Financial and Autocat Group. In addition, we expanded our footprint with several financial services customers this quarter, including Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Kemper and Western Union.\nIndustry-specific investments such as Accounting Center, along with our deep industry knowledge and our rapidly expanding reference base of customers, which now includes more than 70% of the financial services companies in the Fortune 500, are all key to our success. And it's not just the innovation we are driving that is enabling our success but also that of our partners, such as PwC, who created a solution for multidimensional part planning and profitability by leveraging Workday Financials, Extend Accounting Center, Prism and Adaptive Planning.\nOur partners are key to our industry approach, and we're excited by the innovation happening across our ecosystem. We enter FY '23 with healthy pipelines and clear momentum in our business. In order to capitalize on that momentum, we plan to continue making significant investments within our go-to-market and service and support team with key focus areas, including customer base, international industry and emerging land motion, all of which are important growth vectors in achieving our goal of sustaining 20%-plus subscription growth well into the future.\nPart of this investment involves strengthening our leadership team as we continue to scale, to which I'm pleased to welcome Patrick Blair as our newly appointed President of the Americas. Patrick brings more than 25 years of enterprise software sales experience and not only is a proven leader, but he's a great person and a tremendous fit into the organization. I couldn't be more happy to have him join that and the team to lead our largest market.\nWith that, I'm now pleased to hand it over to our newly minted CFO and a cool start within the Workday organization, Barbara Larson. Barbara, over to you.\n\nBarbara Larson\n\nCFO, Workday, Inc.\n\nThanks, Chano. I appreciate the kind words. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I look forward to working with all of you over the coming quarters and years, and I'm thrilled to be joining Aneel, Chano and Pete today to update you on our progress.\nI joined Workday 7 years ago and have witnessed unbelievable growth in the company over that time. One observation I'd make is that our market position has never been stronger, and the broad-based momentum that we saw across the business in Q4 serves as a great validation of that.\nNow let's turn to our results. Subscription revenue was $1.23 billion in Q4, representing year-over-year growth of 22%. For the full year, subscription revenue was $4.55 billion, growth of 20%. Professional services revenue was $147 million for Q4 and $592 million for the full year. Fourth quarter revenue outside of the U.S. was $348 million, representing 25% of total revenue.\n24-month backlog at the end of the fourth quarter was $7.98 billion, growth of 22%. The strong result was driven by new bookings outperformance and continued strength in renewals with growth and net retention rate over 95% and 100%, respectively. Total subscription revenue backlog was $12.81 billion, growth of 27%.\nOur non-GAAP operating income for the fourth quarter was $237 million, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 17.2%. As expected, our non-GAAP operating margin declined from last quarter driven by an accelerated pace of hiring, the rollout of our previously mentioned cash-based performance bonus and other growth investments made across the business, including the recent VNDLY acquisition. For the year, non-GAAP operating income was a record $1.15 billion or 22.4% of total revenue, showcasing the strength of our business model.\nOperating cash flow for Q4 was $615 million, bringing our full year operating cash flow to $1.65 billion, growth of 30%. Record cash flow results were driven by solid operating income performance as well as strong cash collections throughout the year.\nOur largest investments continue to be in our people and attracting top talent to Workday. We successfully added and integrated roughly 1,000 net new employees in Q4, including over 140 from VNDLY, ending the year with more than 15,200 employees, growth of 21% and in line with our hiring aspirations when we entered FY '22. The record hiring is a testament to our culture, our global brand and the significant growth opportunity that we have ahead. Overall, we are very pleased with the strong company-wide execution in our seasonally most important quarter.\nTurning now to guidance. We are encouraged by the significant momentum in our business, and we're optimistic that the environment will remain robust throughout FY '23 as organizations continue to prioritize and invest in their strategic finance and HR transformation initiatives. With that context, we now expect FY '23 subscription revenue to be in the range of $5.53 billion to $5.55 billion, representing 22% year-over-year growth.\nFor the first quarter of FY '23, we expect subscription revenue to be between $1.263 billion and $1.265 billion, representing 23% year-over-year growth at the high end. We expect subscription revenue to increase sequentially by approximately 7% in Q2 and approximately 5.5% in Q3 and Q4. We expect the 24-month backlog to grow approximately 22% in Q1 of FY '23. We are expecting professional services revenue to be approximately $160 million in Q1 and $650 million for the full year. We will continue our tight alignment with our growing partner ecosystem to help ensure customers have successful implementations that support the highest levels of customer satisfaction and business value.\nFrom a margin standpoint, since the onset of COVID, we have demonstrated the scalability inherent in our model. As we've discussed, however, investing for growth remains our #1 priority. In FY '23, we plan to continue hiring across the company at a rapid pace with a focus on sales and products. We are also expecting a return to travel and in-person events. And as we have discussed, we've rolled out a performance-based cash bonus program across the company.\nGiven this ramped level of investment and taking into account our increased revenue outlook, we are raising our FY '23 non-GAAP operating margin guidance to 18.5%. Investing for growth remains our focus, and we will continuously evaluate gross margin trade-off. But we're currently expecting to resume margin expansion in FY '24 and have continued confidence in reaching 25% margin at $10 billion in revenue.\nWe estimate non-GAAP operating margins of approximately 19% in Q1 and expect a normal seasonal sequential decline in Q2 as we invest in our people through our annual compensation process. The GAAP margins for the first quarter and the full year are expected to be approximately 28 and 24 percentage points lower, respectively, than the non-GAAP margin. The FY '23 non-GAAP tax rate remains at 19%.\nWe expect operating cash flow in FY '23 to be approximately $1.65 billion, flat from record levels in FY '22, driven by the ramp in growth investments, the corresponding decrease in margins and an estimated $80 million onetime tax payment related to the expected transfer of acquired intellectual property. We expect capital expenditures of roughly $475 million in FY '23 to support continued business expansion and phased return to office with investments across our existing facilities, corporate IT infrastructure and customer data centers. This includes opportunistic data center investment that was previously planned for FY '24 as we manage the supply chain and plan for future growth.\nAnd finally, I'll close by thanking our amazing employees, customers and partners for their continued support and hard work, which allowed us to deliver exceptional results during yet another unprecedented year. We are more confident than ever in our long-term opportunity ahead.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to the operator to begin Q&A."

(Operator Instructions)\nWith that, I will now hand it over to Justin Furby, Vice President of Investor Relations.\n\nJustin Furby\n\nThank you, operator. Welcome to Workday's Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2023 Earnings Conference Call. On the call, we have Aneel Bhusri and Carl Eschenbach, our co-CEOs; Barbara Larson, our CFO; and Doug Robinson, our co-President. Following prepared remarks, we will take questions.\nOur press release was issued after close of market and is posted on our website, where this call is being simultaneously webcast. Before we get started, we want to emphasize that some of our statements on this call, particularly our guidance, are based on the information we have as of today and include forward-looking statements regarding our financial results, applications, customer demand, operations and other matters.

These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to and not as a substitute for or in isolation from GAAP results. You can find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations with comparable GAAP results, in our earnings press release, in our investor presentation and on the Investor Relations page of our website.\nThe webcast replay of this call will be available for the next 90 days on our company website under the Investor Relations link. Additionally, our quarterly investor presentation will be posted on our Investor Relations website following this call. Also, the customers' page of our website includes a list of selected customers and is updated monthly. Our first quarter fiscal 2024 quiet period begins on April 15, 2023. Unless otherwise stated, all financial comparisons in this call will be to our results for the comparable period of our fiscal 2022.\nWith that, I'll hand the call over to Aneel.\n\nAneel Bhusri\n\nCo-Founder, Co-CEO & Chairman of the Board, Workday, Inc.\n\nThank you, Justin, and welcome to Workday's fiscal 2023 Fourth Quarter and Full Year Financial Results Earnings Call. I'm pleased to share that we delivered solid Q4 results and once again outperformed against our key operating metrics, which included subscription revenue growth of 22% for the quarter and for full year fiscal year '23.\nWhile the macro environment continues to be unpredictable, Workday's value proposition is only getting stronger as more organizations turn to us to help them adapt and manage their 2 most important resources, their people and their finances. As a result, our thriving customer community continues to grow and feel our path to $10 billion in revenue and beyond.\nIn fact, we achieved a significant milestone in Q4 as we surpassed the 10,000 customer mark, with more than 4,750 of those being our core HCM and finance customers, a true testament to the power of the Workday platform and our ability to address the needs for the offices of the CHRO and CFO. Additionally, approximately 629 billion transactions were processed with Workday in fiscal year '23, an increase of 42% year-over-year and further proof of the scale that we have reached.\nBefore we share some Q4 highlights, I want to touch on several recent leadership moves and one organizational announcement that we made, all of which will help set us up for our next phase of growth. The first is the appointment of Carl Eschenbach as co-CEO, which we announced in December. Carl has been a Workday Board member since 2018 and for the past 35 years, has been one of the finest sales and operational leaders in enterprise technology. With his experience and commitment to our values and culture, Carl is a perfect fit to help Workday scale and lead us forward.\nAt the end of our fiscal year '24, Carl is expected to assume sole CEO responsibilities, while I will stay involved with our product and technology teams and all of our employees as a full-time Executive Chair and Chair of the Board. Carl's transition into the co-CEO role has been seamless, and I'm excited to work alongside him going forward as we continue to grow Workday and strengthen our position as the leader in cloud HR while building on our momentum in finance.\nI also want to acknowledge the great work Chano Fernandez did during his 9 years with Workday and for the last 2 years as co-CEO. He played a significant role in helping to shape the company into who we are today, and I want to thank him for his contributions.\nAdditionally, Sayan Chakraborty, our EVP of Product and Technology, has been elevated to co-President alongside Doug Robinson. Since joining Workday more than 7 years ago, Sayan has been a driving force behind our evolving and expanding innovation strategy, led our efforts to scale the Workday platform to support and enable some of the world's largest organizations and is one of the foremost experts in artificial intelligence and machine learning as it relates to the world of enterprise offerings. Sayan will continue to lead our product and technology organization, and we are pleased to recognize his leadership role across the organization now as co-President.\nWith Sayan stepping into a co-President role, Robynne Sisco, who was previously co-President and before that CFO, will now assume the role of Vice Chair. In this role, Robynne will work closely with our global sales team to help us build on our momentum with the office of the CFO and further cement Workday as a leader in cloud finance.\nThe last leadership update is related to our Board of Directors. I'm pleased to share that we announced today that Mark Hawkins has been elected as the newest member of our Board. With more than 35 years of finance leadership experience at global software and technology companies, most recently at Salesforce, Mark will bring invaluable experience and perspective to Workday.\nFinal announcement I want to highlight, which we made at the end of January, was a restructuring and realignment of some teams across Workday that led to the elimination of roles, impacting about 3% of our global workforce. While it's always difficult to see employees leave under those circumstances, we made this decision to align our resources and people against the most strategic areas of the business to help ensure that Workday is set up for continued growth for many years to come. Throughout this process, we did our absolute best to treat the affected employees with compassion and offered them generous severance packages. This restructuring move was not a cost-cutting effort, and we will continue to hire in fiscal year '24 for roles that support our strategic initiatives.\nWith that, I'd like to share some product and technology highlights from the quarter. From an innovation perspective, our continued focus on uniquely embedding AI and ML into the core of our platform is enabling us to drive the future of work for HR and finance customers and their more than 60 million employees around the world.\nOn the HR front, the combination of our Workday Skills Cloud, which is powered by AI and ML, and Workday Talent Optimization is supporting customers in their transition to a skills-first mindset. To date, nearly 50% of all live Workday HCM customers are leveraging Workday Skills Cloud, while Talent Optimization is Workday's fastest-growing SKU with an attach rate on new deals of more than 85% in fiscal year '23.\nFor Planning, we introduced new demand forecasting capabilities that leverage AI and ML to help retailers forecast business demand based on external data, such as sales and foot traffic history. Retail continues to be one of our target industries as more than 50% of the retail organizations in the Fortune 500 are Workday customers. And innovations like this will enable us to build on our momentum in this space.\nWe're also continuing to double down on AI and ML through our Workday Ventures fund. We announced a $250 million expansion of the fund to focus on larger growth areas such as generative AI, all with an eye to embracing emerging technologies to help us further enable our customers in today's changing world of work.\nFinally, I want to touch on how we're continuing to invest in our brand. Hopefully, you all saw our fun rock star-themed advertisement during the Super Bowl, which reached an estimated 110 million viewers. While finance and HR leaders are familiar with us, we saw the Super Bowl as the stage to help us become more well-known to a broader audience. We firmly believe that our brand is strategic, and investments in marketing drive awareness and demand for our products and services.\nGoing forward, we feel very confident in our ability to capitalize on the long-term growth opportunity in front of us, thanks to the strategy we have in place, the mission-critical nature of our solutions and the amazing talents of our more than 17,700 Workmates around the globe. In fact, we are hosting today's call from our annual sales kickoff meeting, and the excitement from all of our go-to-market teams here in Las Vegas about the incredible opportunity we have in front of us is palpable.\nWith that, I'll hand it over to our co-CEO, my buddy, Carl Eschenbach. Carl, over to you.\n\nCarl M. Eschenbach\n\nCo-CEO & Director, Workday, Inc.\n\nThank you, Aneel, for those kind words, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. Let me start by saying that I am humbled and honored by the opportunity to partner and work alongside Aneel and our Workmates across this amazing company. I'm truly energized by Workday's unique opportunity to be one of the largest and most profitable software companies in the world. This was my first quarterly call as co-CEO, and I could not be more proud of our teams for their incredible execution.\nDespite a macro environment that remains uncertain and that no one is immune from, we drove strong close rates in Q4 and built a healthy pipeline for the year ahead. Our team was prepared to respond to the extra scrutiny we knew would come with deals in this environment. And because of that, we are heading into our new fiscal year in a position of strength. I can tell you, the excitement for the year is all around us as we are coming to you live from our annual sales kickoff conference in Las Vegas.\nAs a Board member for the last 5 years, I have been actively involved in Workday's growth journey. Today, more than 2 months in as co-CEO, I have had the privilege of spending time with hundreds of Workmates, customers, partners and prospects around the world. Those meetings have given me an even greater appreciation of how compelling Workday's value proposition is and how differentiated we really are.\nI've also gotten to know Aneel and the leadership team even better. And while I already considered Aneel a partner and a friend, our co-CEO relationship is working really well as we have very complementary skill sets. It's a true one plus one equals three equation.\nAs I reflect upon my first couple of months, a few things in particular have stood out, starting with the culture and values of Workday. This, frankly, was the most important driver for me taking this role. I have long admired the culture that Dave and Aneel built and see it as a true differentiator. We have 6 core values at Workday, and each of them are important. But to me, the one that I keep coming back to is integrity. If you do the right thing, everything else falls into place. I have been blown away by the talent that sits across this company and by how ingrained our values are in everything we do.\nAnother observation is around our land opportunity with net new customers. I will tell you, it's wide open. We have a footprint with over 50% of the Fortune 500 and more than 25% of the Global 2000, but we still see plenty of room to grow. Q4 was a great validation of this, with 7 new Fortune 500 and 11 new Global 2000 customers. New HCM customers we added in the quarter included Allstate, Camping World, Cracker Barrel, Delaware North Companies, Mercedes-Benz Group and Whataburger. And key go-live included Heidelberg Materials and Mitsui Chemicals.\nIn addition, we once again added several full platform HCM and financial customers, including Fidelity National Title, Panda Restaurant Group and the State of Georgia. And we had several FINS go-live, including The New York Times and Sanford Health.\nOne of the exciting things about our land opportunity is that it's not limited to replacing outdated on-premises systems. In fact, 3 of our new Fortune 500 wins replaced cloud solutions from our legacy ERP competitors. And the land opportunity extends well beyond the upmarket as the medium enterprise has become an increasingly important driver of net new ACV, and that team drove record performance in the quarter.\nWhat's also important is the strength of our customer relationships and the strategic nature of what we do for them. This provides us with an incredible opportunity to expand our business with our installed base of customers who rely on Workday as their intelligent digital backbone to adapt and manage their people and money. This quarter, we once again drove very strong renewals along with solid new ACV bookings, including expansions at Belk, GE, Old Dominion Freight, Prudential and Truist. We saw momentum across our solutions portfolio, including Learning, Planning, Prism Analytics, Accounting Center and candidate engagement. And an increasing number of our expansion deals added core financials as we lean into our market leadership in HCM to drive increasing momentum with the office of the CFO.\nOur opportunity is truly global. The U.S., which continues to be our largest market, had a solid Q4 and has a healthy runway going forward. We also have a tremendous international opportunity, which is only about 1/4 of our revenue, but more than half of our TAM. Our momentum is building in strategic markets like DACH and Nordics, where we had a number of important wins during Q4, including CCB Management Services, [Mila] and NorgesGruppen. Accelerating our international business is a strategic priority, and we are investing in both talent and products to help drive that.\nOur continued industry focus is gaining momentum, and it is a core part of our ongoing strategy. We had wins in a number of key verticals in Q4, including state and local government, where in addition to the win at the State of Georgia, we had wins at the City of Boston, the City of Charlotte and New York City Housing Authority to name a few. In fact, new ACV from our state and local teams more than doubled year-over-year in Q4, and we expect our traction to continue in FY '24.\nFinally, our partner ecosystem will be critical to our next phase of growth. Our partners from the global system integrators to the boutiques have been incredibly important to get us to where we are today. They drive the vast majority of our customer deployments and serve as an important source of co-innovation. One of the ways they do this is through Workday Extend, which now has over 1,000 applications in production across our customer community. We expect our partners will play an even more important role in FY '24 as we look for them to drive an increased number of new opportunities while we strategically shift more customer deployments to our ecosystem. We see this as a clear win-win.\nWe are also focusing our efforts across our broader ecosystem of ISVs and technology partners. A great example is our recent partnership with AWS, which extends our infrastructure relationship to a more formal go-to-market motion. I am excited to work alongside our Chief Customer Officer, Sheri Rhodes, and our newly appointed SVP of Global Partners, Matt Brandt, and our entire ecosystem on this journey.\nHeading into FY '24, we have a clear strategy in place, which is rooted in strengthening our HCM market leadership and winning in FINS across our key industries. We are optimizing the business to double down in strategic growth areas such as investing in our customer base, focusing on key industries, evolving and investing in our partner ecosystem and relentlessly focusing on innovation, including shaping the future of work to our application of AI and machine learning.\nHaving the right strategy is only part of the equation. You also need the right people, which is why we plan to continue to add sales capacity and key engineering talent as we position Workday for the next wave of growth. We also made some recent changes to strengthen our leadership bench that will be critical to helping us execute on our strategy. Doug Robinson will continue in his role as co-President and now has full responsibility for all go-to-market functions.\nAs Aneel mentioned, Sayan Chakraborty has also been elevated to co-President. And I'm also excited to have Robynne Sisco serve as our Vice Chair, now squarely focused on helping us sell FINS. Patrick Blair, who joined a year ago to run North America sales, has been elevated to Head of Global Sales. His team across the regions is a talented mix of seasoned Workday veterans and proven recently added external talent, who will rally around our global opportunity.\nIt's an amazing time to be at Workday, and I'm so inspired and energized by the incredible journey ahead. While we continue to see certain sales cycles, primarily net new opportunities taking longer than normal to close, our FY '24 subscription revenue guidance prudently factors this in. And we are positioning the business to return to 20% plus subscription revenue growth when the environment improves while simultaneously delivering margin expansion. I look forward to meeting many of you on the road in the quarter ahead, and thank you for your support.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Barbara. Barbara, over to you.\n\nBarbara Larson\n\nCFO, Workday, Inc.\n\nThanks, Carl, and welcome. I know I speak for the broader Workday organization when I say that I'm incredibly excited to partner with you on the next phase of our growth journey.\nAs Aneel and Carl mentioned, we had a solid close to the year, driven by strong execution across the company combined with durable demand for our solutions as organizations of all sizes prioritize finance and HR modernization during these uncertain times.\nSubscription revenue in Q4 was $1.50 billion, up 22% year-over-year. For the full year, subscription revenue was $5.57 billion, also a growth of 22%. Professional services revenue was $151 million for Q4 and $649 million for the full year. Total revenue outside of the U.S. was $396 million in Q4, representing 24% of total revenue.\n24-month subscription revenue backlog at the end of the fourth quarter was $9.68 billion, up 21%. The result was driven by solid new ACV bookings and strong renewals, with growth and net revenue and retention rates over 95% and over 100%, respectively. In addition, early renewals added roughly 1 percentage point of upside to 24-month backlog growth and roughly 2 percentage points to total backlog growth. Total subscription revenue backlog at the end of Q4 was $16.45 billion, up 28%.\nOur non-GAAP operating income for the fourth quarter was $305 million, resulting in non-GAAP operating margin of 18.5%. Margin overachievement was driven by revenue upside and continued cost discipline. The workforce realignment we announced at the end of January was a $34 million non-GAAP expense in the quarter, or a roughly 2 percentage point headwind to Q4 non-GAAP operating margin, most of which was factored into our guidance. For the year, non-GAAP operating income was $1.21 billion, representing a margin of 19.5%.\nQ4 operating cash flow was $694 million, growth of 13%. As a reminder, the Q4 result was impacted by a roughly $70 million onetime IP transfer tax payment. Full year operating cash flow was $1.66 billion. During the quarter, we repurchased roughly $75 million in shares and have $425 million in remaining authorization under our buyback program.\nWe ended the fourth quarter with more than 17,700 global Workmates. As Aneel and Carl mentioned, we will continue to add key talent across strategic growth areas of the business, notably go-to-market and product and technology, but we are planning for fewer headcount additions in FY '24 as compared to FY '23. Overall, we're very proud of the strong company-wide execution in Q4, and we enter FY '24 in a position of strength.\nNow turning to guidance, which reflects both the continued momentum in our business while also balancing what remains an uncertain macro environment. In addition, we recently completed an assessment of our server and network equipment. And beginning in FY '24, we are increasing the useful life assumption from 3 years to 5 years, reflecting advances in technology that we're benefiting from. This change will have a positive impact on our FY '24 non-GAAP operating margin, which I will cover shortly.\nFollowing a solid Q4, we are maintaining the midpoint of our preliminary FY '24 subscription revenue guidance and narrowing the range to $6.525 billion to $6.575 billion, representing 17% to 18% year-over-year growth. We view this guidance as prudent in the context of the environment. But as Carl mentioned, we're positioning to return to a 20% plus subscription revenue growth when the environment improves.\nWe expect Q1 FY '24 subscription revenue to be $1.517 billion to $1.520 billion, representing 19% year-over-year growth. We expect subscription revenue to increase sequentially by approximately 6% in Q2 and approximately 4% in Q3. We expect FY '24 professional services revenue to be in the range of $630 million to $650 million. As Carl mentioned, we are strategically shifting more deployments to our partner ecosystem as part of ongoing investments we are making in the channel. For Q1, we expect professional services revenue of $148 million.\nWe expect 24-month backlog to grow approximately 20% year-over-year in Q1. We currently expect FY '24 non-GAAP operating margin of 23%. The expected margin expansion is primarily being driven by the scalability of our model, a strong moderation of hiring and ongoing expense discipline.\nIn addition, we estimate the change in server and network equipment useful life will result in a roughly $100 million reduction to the GAAP and non-GAAP cost of subscription revenue in FY '24, creating a benefit to operating margin of about 150 basis points this year. Looking forward, the impact from this policy change is expected to trend down and result in an approximately $50 million reduction to GAAP and non-GAAP cost of subscription revenue in FY '25.\nWe estimate Q1 non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 21.5% and expect a normal seasonal sequential decline in Q2 as we invest in our people through our annual compensation process. GAAP operating margins for the first quarter and the full year are expected to be approximately 26 and 22 percentage points lower, respectively, than the non-GAAP margins. The FY '24 non-GAAP tax rate remains at 19%.\nWe expect FY '24 operating cash flow of approximately $2.05 billion, growth of 24%. On a year-over-year basis, our first quarter cash flow will be impacted by the first full year payout of our performance-based cash bonus plan, severance cost associated with the recent realignment and an interest payment that did not occur last Q1 due to the timing of our debt offering. We expect capital expenditures of approximately $340 million in FY '24 to support our continued business expansion.\nAnd finally, I'll close by thanking our amazing employees, customers and partners for their continued support and hard work. With that, I'll turn it over to the operator to begin Q&A."

[Operator Instructions]\nI will now hand it over to Justin Furby, Vice President of Investor Relations. Justin, you may begin.\n\nJustin Furby\n\nAnalyst, William Blair & Co. LLC\n\nThank you, operator. Welcome to Workday's Third Quarter Fiscal 2024 Earnings Conference Call. On the call, we have Aneel Bhusri and Carl Eschenbach, our co-CEOs; Zane Rowe, our CFO; and Doug Robinson, our Co-President. Following prepared remarks, we will take questions.\nOur press release was issued after close of market and is posted on our website, where this call is being simultaneously webcast. Before we get started, we want to emphasize that some of our statements on this call, particularly our guidance, are based on the information we have as of today and include forward-looking statements regarding our financial results, applications, customer demand, operations and other matters. These statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially.\nPlease refer to the press release and the risk factors and documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our fiscal 2023 annual report on Form 10-K and our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q for additional information on risks, uncertainties and assumptions that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in such statements.\nIn addition, during today's call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are useful as supplemental measures of Workday's performance. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to and not as a substitute for or in isolation from GAAP results. You can find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations with comparable GAAP results, in our earnings press release, in our investor presentation and on the Investor Relations page of our website.\nThe webcast replay of this call will be available for the next 90 days on our company website under the Investor Relations link. Additionally, our quarterly investor presentation will be posted on our Investor Relations website following this call. Also, the customers' page of our website includes a list of selected customers and is updated monthly.\nOur fourth quarter fiscal 2024 quiet period begins on January 15, 2024. Unless otherwise stated, all financial comparisons in this call will be to our results for the comparable period of our fiscal 2023.\nWith that, I'll hand the call over to Carl.\n\nCarl Eschenbach\n\nChief Operating Officer and Co-President, VMware, Inc.\n\nThank you, Justin, and thank you, everyone, for joining our Q3 FY '21 earnings call. I'm pleased to share that Workday delivered another strong quarter, achieving 18% subscription revenue growth, 22% 12-month backlog growth and non-GAAP operating margin of 25%. These results were driven by broad-based strength across net new and customer base teams, medium and large enterprise and across regions, notably the U.S. and EMEA. I want to thank the more than 18,300 Workmates around the globe for partnering with our customers to help drive these impressive results.\nThere is a clear sense of momentum across our business. and it was on full display at Workday Rising in September. There, we unleashed new AI innovation, delivered product and partnership announcements and drew a record 28,000 attendees in person and online. In fact, over half of our active pipeline was touched by a Rising event in San Francisco and just a couple of weeks ago in Barcelona, we followed up with our largest ever EMEA Rising event with over 4,500 people in attendance.\nIn speaking with customers, prospects and partners at these events, a few things stood out to me. First, talent continues to be a top C-suite priority. In this macro environment, businesses are looking to scale and drive productivity. They can't achieve both outcomes by simply hiring more. Leaders are turning to Workday to help them reskill and upskill their workforce, all while delivering a great employee experience. That helps them reduce attrition and ultimately drives productivity. Second, leaders are continuing to consolidate their technology footprint on a true platform to realize total cost of ownership benefits, while also accelerating their operations. Workday is perfectly positioned to benefit as the intelligent digital backbone businesses can rely on to manage their most precious assets: their people and their money. And finally, AI, and in particular, generative AI is becoming a business imperative. As a trusted partner and a market leader with over 65 million users under contract, we can uniquely drive efficiencies and improve the employee experience. Aneel will share more, but I will say that it is what we are doing and not just saying that it's resonating with our customers.\nSimply put, our value proposition has never been so relevant and powerful. That's clear in the results our team delivered in Q3 and in the first half of FY '24. At our recent financial Analyst Day, we talked about the diversity and durability of our business and how it helps us grow during times of headwinds and times of tailwinds. This theme was evident in the wins we had this quarter.\nFrom a net new customer perspective, we once again saw strength in full platform deals. We welcomed customers like AdventHealth, Bentley Systems, Houston Methodist and Lifespan as new full platform HCM and Financials customers, and new HCM customers such as Greene King Brewing, Group 1 Automotive, Minor Hotel Group and the U.S. Department of Energy helped us surpass 5,000 core HCM customers on Workday.\nAlongside helping new customer activity, we had several strategic expansions and renewals in the quarter, including Magna International, Mondelez Global, Sonoco Products Company and Southwest Airlines. And I'm pleased to share that our Create and Close business had another great quarter and is becoming a meaningful driver of our customer-based sales team's growth.\nNow I want to highlight some of the key growth areas we discussed with you at Financial Analyst Day. Starting with international, which represents over half our addressable opportunity. In EMEA, I'm pleased to say that our leadership additions are driving improved and more consistent results. The team here once again delivered strong new ACV, particularly in the U.K., Germany, France and Spain and helped us eclipse the $1 billion ARR mark in the region.\nWin rates were robust against our competitors, even in their own backyards. We had important new wins like AXA UK, AURELIUS Group and international schools, along with expansions at BBVA, Carl Zeiss and Thales Global Services, among others. And in the Asia Pacific region, Australia performed well with wins such as Ramsay Health Care and Wesley Mission Queensland.\nWe still have work to do in APAC, but we're focused on it, and I'm delighted Simon Tate has joined us to run the region. We're also making important investments in Japan to help expand our opportunity within one of the world's largest economies. As part of this, our leader in Japan will now report directly to Patrick Blair, our President of Global Sales.\nMoving to Financials. We're seeing proof that our go-to-market investments are continuing to pay off with healthy growth in both core financial customers and new ACV. New full platform wins are on the rise, and our industry approach is contributing to this momentum. Healthcare, for example, grew new ACV over 50% in Q3, and roughly half of the healthcare deals we landed in the quarter were full platform.\nState and local government also continues to outperform with strategic full platform wins at County of Kern, County of Chesterfield and the Pennsylvania General Assembly. Our back-to-base motion in Financials also delivered in Q3. Wins included Clearwater Analytics, Ochsner Clinic Foundation and Concentrix, which expanded their Workday HR footprint to include core financials when it combined with Webhelp, a Workday core Financials customer in EMEA.\nOur planning business also had a strong Q3, and we welcomed AWS as a planning customer along with NPR and stores Kogan Group. And finally, our win rates remain strong, and we see a growing pipeline of opportunities to replace our legacy ERP competitors.\nOn the partner front, we've always recognized the vital role our ecosystem plays in our customer success and it starts with go-lives. HCM go-lives this quarter included American Electric Power, Dave & Buster's and Iberdrola, along with Financials go-lives at NorthShore University HealthSystem SolutionHealth and Weis Markets. Increasingly, we're leaning into our partner ecosystem in other strategic ways.\nOur skills accelerator partnership with Accenture, which we announced at EMEA Rising, is a great example. Accenture will be reselling our skills solution, providing their own services expertise on top of the Workday Skills Cloud. We also announced a partnership with ADP to extend the capability of Workday HCM with ADP's payroll and SmartCompliance solutions in key global markets. And we announced AI Marketplace at Rising, which allows us to innovate with our ecosystem of partners to deliver trusted and responsible AI solutions for our customers' most compelling use cases.\nFinally, we see strong momentum from our partner referral program we launched earlier this year. We've already exceeded our full year targets for the number of partners that have signed on. And while it's early, we are starting to see a positive impact to our pipeline.\nAnother key investment area is around AI, which we've been building into our platform for nearly a decade. As I mentioned, at Rising, we demonstrated our leadership with new announcements in demos that illustrated how AI will shape the future of work. I won't steal Aneel's thunder. He'll be joining in just a minute to share more.\nIn closing, we had another quarter of strong and consistent performance amidst a dynamic environment. The diversity and mission-critical nature of our business continues to fuel our success. As we move through Q4, we have a solid pipeline and clear momentum for our solutions. And while we are clearly focused on delivering in the near term, we have our sights set on delivering durable 17% to 19% subscription revenue growth over the long term while expanding margins.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to my Co-CEO and good friend, Aneel, who will share more about our AI strategy and innovation highlights from the quarter. Aneel, over to you.\n\nAneel Bhusri\n\nCo-Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Workday, Inc.\n\nThank you, Carl, and to everyone joining today's call. As you heard Carl mention, an increasing number of organizations across all industries and geographies are continuing to place their trust in Workday, which is why we remain focused on delivering the innovation our customers need to thrive in today's environment.\nFor the last couple of quarters, we've highlighted our longstanding and differentiated approach to AI, including generative AI, that is driven by our platform strategy, unrivaled data set, emphasis on being human-centric and commitment to delivering responsible and trustworthy solutions. At Workday Rising in September, our leadership in this space was showcased in a big way as we unveiled a series of new AI capabilities that will help redefine the way our customers work.\nOn the generative AI front, we announced several new capabilities that will benefit all users with an emphasis on increasing productivity, growing and retaining talent, streamlining business processes and driving better decision-making. Examples of the use cases we previewed, which we expect to be available next year, include the ability to generate job descriptions in minutes versus hours; analyze and correct contracts for faster, more accurate revenue recognition; create employee growth plans to foster and retain talent; and provide text-to-code generation capabilities to increase productivity of app development and Workday Extend.\nAnother way we're infusing generative AI into our platform is through our investment in conversational AI. While we are still in an exploratory phase with this technology, we believe conversational AI will fundamentally change how users interact with Workday by enabling them to easily surface information they need and interact with data through simple conversation.\nWe're also leveraging generative AI to create a conversational experience for Workday Adaptive Planning customers. The use of conversational text will simplify the process of surfacing key planning insights, enabling users to make quicker, more fatigue decisions about their businesses.\nAdditionally, we announced enhancements to Workday Extend, which continues to be a critical solution to help bring the Workday platform to life for our customers and partners. In fact, we've seen an increase of more than 70% in the number of apps built by customers and partners with Extend in the last year alone. At Rising, we unveiled Workday AI Gateway, which is available in Workday Extend. Our AI Gateway provides developers with access to Workday's AI services to enhance our ability to build intelligent and responsible apps on the Workday platform.\nTurning to the office of the CHRO. We introduced several new features within Workday HCM that leverage AI, many with a focus on elevating the manager experience by providing them with the tools and insights they need to effectively lead and foster the career growth of their teams. One example is Manager Insights Hub, which leverages AI to surface personalized recommendations and make it easier for managers to identify the best opportunities for their employees based on skills interest to improve talent mobility and employee engagement.\nAnd while we will continue to deliver on the promise of AI for our customers, many of our partners and other enterprise companies are delivering on the promise of AI as well. As Carl mentioned, we announced our AI marketplace to help harness the AI innovation happening across our ecosystem. To date, we have 15 early adopters, and that number will increase over time as we expand to include tailored solutions delivered by our partner ecosystem, Workday-related capabilities and third-party products and native AI-powered Workday Extend apps.\nOf course, none of these AI advancements can truly be effective without the right safeguards and regulations in place. Building on our continued efforts to advocate for smart AI policy at the federal level, Workday's Josh Landon, Vice President of Productivity Technology, was invited to testify before Congress on AI in the future of work. Josh spoke to the potential of AI to enhance how workers collaborate and amplify human potential and the steps Workday is taking to deploy these technologies in a trustworthy and responsible manner.\nAt the application level, Workday products continue to be recognized for the innovation that we deliver to customers. For the office of the CHRO, Workday was named a leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Cloud HCM Suites for 1,000+ Employee Enterprises. Workday was positioned highest for ability to execute, and it marked the eighth consecutive year we were recognized as a leader.\nAdditionally, Workday VNDLY was named a 2023 Top HR Product of the Year by Human Resource Executive. The award recognized VNDLY's ability to provide organizations with a full set of capabilities for end-to-end life cycle management of external workers and its ability to integrate with Workday HCM to support full visibility into head count spend and more. And for the office of the CFO, Workday was named a leader in the 2023 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Cloud ERP for Service-Centric Enterprises based on completeness of vision and ability to execute. This is the second year in a row that Workday was recognized as a leader.\nIn closing, I want to thank the entire Workday team for their incredible efforts in Q3. We have an amazing opportunity in front of us, and I remain confident in our ability to capitalize on it, thanks in large part to our more than 18,300 Workmates. They are relentlessly focused on driving innovation across the entire Workday platform to actively address our customers' finance and HR needs.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to our CFO, Zane Rowe. Over to you, Zane.\n\nZane Rowe\n\nnullChief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President\n\nThanks, Aneel, and thank you to everyone for joining today's call. As Carl and Aneel mentioned, Q3 was a strong quarter, highlighting the durability of our business and ongoing market adoption for cloud Financials and HCM.\nTurning to results. Subscription revenue in Q3 was $1.69 billion, up 18% year-over-year. Professional services revenue was $175 million, leading to total revenue of $1.87 billion, growth of 17%. U.S. revenue totaled $1.4 billion, growing 17%, and international revenue totaled $462 million, growing at the same rate.\nAs we've highlighted, we see significant long-term international opportunities, which we expect over time will become a more meaningful driver of our growth. As we discussed at our recent financial Analyst Day, we are providing our 12-month subscription revenue backlog, or CRPO, which was $6.05 billion at the end of Q3, representing growth of 22%.\nThe result was driven by strong new ACV bookings and healthy renewals, with gross and net revenue retention rates of over 95% and over 100%, respectively. Early renewals in the quarter exceeded our expectations, adding more than 1 point of growth to 12-month backlog, and early renewals from prior quarters also continued to benefit backlog growth in Q3. 24-month subscription revenue backlog was $10.58 billion at the end of Q3, up 23%.\nEarly renewals in the quarter added nearly 2 points of growth to the result. Total subscription revenue backlog at the end of the quarter was $18.45 billion, up 31%. Backlog benefits from increased contract duration, which speaks to our customers' continued commitment to our platform.\nOur non-GAAP operating income for the third quarter was $462 million, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 24.8%. Margin strength relative to our guidance was driven by revenue outperformance and the timing of certain expenses and investments, which we expect to build in the fourth quarter. Q3 operating cash flow was $451 million, growing 10%.\nDuring Q3, we repurchased $148 million of our shares at an average price of $218.35 per share, and we had $139 million in remaining authorization under our buyback program as of quarter end. We intend to execute on the remaining authorization of our buyback during Q4.\nWe ended the quarter with $6.9 billion in cash and marketable securities. We continue to invest in growth areas in the business, and we ended October with over 18,300 Workmates around the globe.\nNow turning to guidance. Following our continued momentum in Q3, we are raising our full year FY '24 subscription revenue guidance to $6.598 billion, representing 19% year-over-year growth. We expect Q4 subscription revenue to be $1.755 billion, representing 17% year-over-year growth. We now expect professional services revenue of $158 million in Q4 and $652 million for the full year.\nIn Q4, we expect 12-month backlog to grow approximately 19%. This includes our current outlook for early renewals in the quarter. We plan to continue disclosing our 12-month, 24-month and total backlog, but intend to provide guidance on 12 months going forward.\nWe are raising our FY '24 non-GAAP operating margin guidance to 23.8%. And for Q4, we expect a non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 23.5% as we ramp up our key investment areas. GAAP operating margins for the fourth quarter and full year are expected to be approximately 20 and 22 percentage points lower than the non-GAAP margins, respectively.\nThe FY '24 non-GAAP tax rate remains at 19%. We are raising our FY '24 operating cash flow outlook to $1.975 billion, growth of 19% year-over-year. In addition, we now expect FY '24 capital expenditures of approximately $250 million. As we discussed at our recent financial Analyst Day, we see considerable opportunity to drive durable, profitable growth over the longer term.\nThe financial framework, which we shared in September is further bolstered by our Q3 performance and the momentum we see building across key growth areas of our business. In light of the continued uncertain macro and incorporating our Q4 outlook, we currently expect FY '25 subscription revenue of approximately $7.725 billion to $7.775 billion, representing growth of 17% to 18%. We also expect to expand our FY '25 non-GAAP operating margins from FY '24 levels.\nOur outlook contemplates incremental investments across our key growth initiatives while delivering continued margin expansion as we scale and optimize the business. The confidence in our outlook is supported by the advocacy and support of our customers, partners and Workmates who are all key contributors to our success.\nWith that, I'll turn it back over to the operator to begin Q&A."

These statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to the press release and the risk factors and documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our fiscal 2023 annual report on Form 10-K and our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q, for additional information on risks, uncertainties and assumptions that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in such statements.\nIn addition, during today's call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are useful as supplemental measures of Workday's performance. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or in isolation from, GAAP results. You can find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations with comparable GAAP results, in our earnings press release, in our investor presentation and on the Investor Relations page of our website.\nThe webcast replay of this call will be available for the next 90 days on our company website under the Investor Relations link. Additionally, our quarterly investor presentation will be posted on our Investor Relations website following this call. Also, the customers' page of our website includes a list of selected customers and is updated monthly. Our third quarter fiscal 2024 quiet period begins on October 15, 2023. Unless otherwise stated, all financial comparisons in this call will be to our results for the comparable period of our fiscal 2023.\nWith that, I'll hand the call over to Carl.\n\nCarl Eschenbach\n\nChief Operating Officer and Co-President, VMware, Inc.\n\nThank you, Justin, and welcome to Workday's Second Quarter Fiscal '24 Earnings Call. I am pleased to report that we delivered another solid quarter, achieving subscription revenue growth of 19%, 24-month backlog growth of 23% and non-GAAP operating margin of 24%. While we continue to see deal scrutiny, our workmates around the world did a remarkable job staying close to our customers in driving this quarter's results and positioning us for strength in the second half of the year and beyond. Workday continues to stand out from the crowd for a few key reasons.\nFirst, the mission-critical nature of our platform. Our customers, now representing more than 65 million users under contract, are all-in on Workday because they trust us to manage their two most important assets: Their people and their money. Trust is at the core of our customer relationships, and we will always work to earn it.\nSecond, our value proposition is strengthening as businesses consolidate their technology footprint from best-of-breed solutions to a true platform. Workday is a trusted platform they can turn to, to drive productivity gains, agility, skills-based talent strategies and a great employee experience all at the same time.\nThird is our unique approach to AI and ML, and Aneel will share more on our progress here shortly. And finally, our winning culture and talent, which is only getting stronger as we continue to attract our industry's best talent.\nWe recently welcomed Emma Chalwin as Chief Marketing Officer. Emma's not only a great culture fit, but she has extensive global experience across all facets of marketing at companies like Salesforce and Adobe. We also recently hired an incredible head of our U.S. federal government team and a senior executive in sales operations and another in our services organization to help us scale our go-to-market efforts.\nAnd of course, you all know our CFO, Zane Rowe, who is joining us today for his first earnings call. I could not be more excited to welcome these leaders, who, along with our existing team, will help us achieve our next phase of growth.\nTurning to the highlights of the quarter. I will focus on 5 key areas: land, expand, global, industries and partners. Starting with land, we see full Financials and HCM platform wins on the rise, illustrating the trust customers have in Workday. Wins this quarter include Advocate Health, AssuredPartners, Carillion Services, Fortrea, KinderCare and University of Florida. And we continue to build on our market leadership position in HCM with new customer wins, including Fresenius Digital Technology, Stellantis and Rio Tinto.\nOnce we land customers, we immediately turn our efforts to successful deployments. In Q2, notable HCM go-lives include A1 Telekom Austria, Korean Airlines, Nike and Rite Aid. Strategic financial go-lives include Fitness International, MultiCare Health Systems, Wintrust and the University of Washington. We also celebrated our first FedRAMP Go Live, which was a full platform rollout at a well-known civilian agency.\nExpanding our existing business with customers is key to our growth strategy. In addition to strong renewals this quarter, we had a number of expansions at companies such as Airbus, Dell Technologies, Lloyds Bank, Lowe's Companies and 7-Eleven. Our faster time-to-value solutions, which includes Planning, Peakon, Extend, Health and Talent Optimization continue to gain traction with many deals created and closed within the quarter.\nThis year, we put increased focus on Financial's go-to-market, and it's starting to bear fruit, with healthy customer growth in Q2. Beyond the full platform deals I mentioned earlier, we had a number of financial expansion wins in the quarter, including the Medical College of Wisconsin, Nordic Consulting and Rakuten. Given our momentum, we continue to invest in Financial's targeted sellers to lay the foundation for durable growth.\nFrom a geographic perspective, the U.S. continues to be our largest market, representing 75% of our revenue. The U.S. team drove solid results in Q2, with particular strength coming from our customer base and industry teams. We have a significant runway for growth in this market and a healthy pipeline looking forward.\nExpanding our footprint globally is among our largest untapped opportunities and is a top priority. During Q2, we held 20 Elevate customer events across EMEA and APJ, attracting over 5,000 attendees and generating hundreds of leads in net new opportunities. Not only are we building pipeline, we're starting to see more consistent execution in certain regions, notably EMEA. We saw strength in key markets such as Germany, U.K. and France, where wins included Rhenus Assets, Symrise, National Westminster Bank and ALD Automotive SA.\nOur industry-first approach is paying off. This quarter, retail and hospitality became our second industry joining Financial Services to exceed $1 billion in annual recurring revenue. And we continue to have strong momentum in Financial Services, which outperformed in Q2.\nThe health care team also delivered another strong performance, with 3 large hospital systems going all-in on Workday's platform in Q2. A great example is Advocate Health, which is part of their merger with Atrium Health, selected Workday to replace a competitor's cloud HCM Financials and Supply Chain Management solution.\nWorkday Supply Chain continues to contribute to our traction in health care with more than 220 health care organizations investing in it to reduce costs, promote standardization and boost resiliency. Finally, our Education and Government team followed up a strong start to the year with an impressive Q2, with wins such as West Virginia University, DePaul University and Metropolitan Community College, to name a few.\nThe potential we have to accelerate our growth through our partner community is huge. We are seeing early signs that our partner referral program will positively impact new logos, and our partnership with the AWS Marketplace led to multiple strategic wins in Q2.\nIn EMEA, our recently announced payroll partnership with Alight is beginning to drive pipeline. And in APJ, our strategic partnership expansion with Samsung SDS is not only helping us drive overall business in South Korea, it also is enabling the development of region-specific applications built on Workday Extend.\nAfter spending time with many of our partners at our Annual Altitude Conference this past quarter, it is clear our momentum is building. We look forward to welcoming more than 15,000 members of our Workday community at our Annual Workday Rising Conference next month in San Francisco. We hope to see many of you there.\nAs this quarter's results show, the diversity and mission-critical nature of our business continues to fuel our success. We are the clear market leader for cloud HCM and finance, and our value proposition has never been more relevant or powerful. We are investing across our product portfolio, geographies, industries and through partnerships to drive durable long-term growth.\nIt is an incredible and exciting time to be a Workmate, and I truly believe our future has never been brighter. With that, I will turn it over to my co-CEO and good friend, Aneel, who will share more about our AI and ML strategy and innovation highlights from the quarter. Aneel, over to you.\n\nAneel Bhusri\n\nCo-Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Workday, Inc.\n\nThank you, Carl, and to everyone joining today's call, and especially to our nearly 17,900 Workmates around the world for helping deliver another solid quarter. I couldn't agree more with the sentiment that our future is extremely bright. I've been on the road a lot recently to meet with current and prospective customers, and one thing is abundantly clear: more and more organizations are looking to Workday to be their trusted partner to help them navigate today's business landscape and thrive in this new world of work.\nCritical to our ability to be that trusted partner is our continued focus on artificial intelligence and machine learning, including generative AI. Last quarter, I highlighted Workday's unique approach to AI and ML, which began in earnest in 2014 with a focus on 3 key aspects: AI and ML are embedded into the core of our platform, we place an emphasis on being human-centric with our AI and ML strategy, and we continue to believe the true potential of AI and ML can only be met by ensuring that it is leveraged in a trustworthy and ethical way.\nLooking ahead, generative AI will continue to be a major focus for us. Despite the recent hype cycle, Workday has been using large language models for years, and we're continuing to invest in a big way. What helps further set Workday apart is our unrivaled data set quality, which is fueled by our more than 65 million users under contract and $600 billion annual transactions to create data models that provide accurate, meaningful, and most importantly, trustworthy results.\nWe're currently building product capabilities that leverage generative AI for a variety of tests. Examples include natural language generation, content search, content summarization, content augmentation and document understanding. And we're looking beyond those use cases at how we can also leverage copilots, agents and conversational UI. Each will help our customers redefine the way they work, and we look forward to previewing these new capabilities along with the rest of our latest AI developments at Workday Rising in September.\nAll told, our differentiated approach is working as we are seeing continued momentum across the board with our over 3,000 customers having opted into sharing their data with our ML models. And we know they are realizing value once they have opted in as we are processing more than 50 million ML inferences per day, an increase of more than 60% year-over-year.\nFurthermore, we believe that the enhanced value that AI and generative AI provide to our customers will also create economic benefits to Workday by positively influencing competitive win rates, renewal rates and our already industry-leading customer satisfaction. We plan to offer most AI capabilities to our customers who opt in as part of their current product subscription with generous base usage entitlements.\nWe also expect AI to open up new market opportunities with direct monetization that are wholly based on AI technologies, similar to our talent optimization solution that leverages Skills Cloud, one of our fastest-growing SKUs. Last quarter, I also shared our perspective on the growing importance of AI safeguards and the active role we're playing in driving the development of smart regulations.\nSince then, the EU has entered final negotiations on its AI Act, which we expect to shape AI regulation globally. We've worked closely with policymakers in Europe over the last 2 years, and we're pleased to see many of our suggestions accepted in the Parliaments version that was recently approved.\nIn the U.S., under the leadership of Sayan Chakraborty, our Co-President, we played a leading role in helping develop the AI framework for the National Institute of Standards and Technology, or NIST, which is a how-to guide for organizations to develop and use trustworthy AI. We are leading by example by implementing the NIST AI framework, and we're working with Congress to encourage adoption of it throughout the federal government.\nWe are also helping to drive the conversation with lawmakers at the state level, including California, as they look to find a path forward for new AI regulations. We're helping them develop legislative frameworks that build trust in AI tools while driving innovation across the enterprise. As we continue to drive thoughtful and concrete policy approaches to responsible AI, you'll hear more from us on our work in the EU, the U.S. and around the world at this pivotal moment for AI policy.\nOn the application front, we're continuing to see our innovation story resonate with customers who are increasingly selecting Workday over the competition. According to Gartner Enterprise Application Software as a Service, market share research, which was published in Q2, Workday had the highest worldwide market share in 2022 for SaaS ERP at 21%. Additionally, we crossed another milestone in Q2 with more than 5,000 core HCM and finance customers, a testament to the power of the Workday platform.\nFor the office of the CFO, we enhanced Workday Adaptive Planning with the next generation of our patented Elastic Hypercube technology. Powered by new AI and performance improvements, Workday Adaptive Planning can now support our customers' most complex planning requirements, scaling automatically without sacrificing speed or performance.\nFurther proof to the continued momentum we are seeing with this application, Workday Adaptive Planning was named Best Financial Management Solution in the 2023 SIIA CODIE Awards. Workday was also named the Customer's Choice in the 2023 Gartner Peer Insights Voice of the Customer for Financial Planning Software report.\nAdditionally, Workday Accounting Center is proving to be a true difference maker for the office of the CFO, as shown by the 70% year-over-year growth it experienced in Q2. Today, Accounting Center is helping more than 150 customers across a dozen industries to pull from a larger, more diverse spectrum of operational data sources to deliver increased granular insights and allow them to better understand their profitability, all in one system.\nAnd for the office of the CHRO, Workday HCM was named a leader in the Forrester Wave: Human Capital Management Q2 2023 report, which highlighted our investments in VNDLY and Workday Peakon Employee Voice as well as our use of embedded AI and ML to reduce user friction.\nIn closing, I'm confident that our continued focus on driving innovation across the entire Workday platform will not only position us for future growth on our path to $10 billion in revenue but also play an integral role in helping us continue to build the highest levels of trust with our more than 10,000 customers. I'm excited to see many of you next month for Workday Rising, which is back in the Bay Area for 2023.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to our CFO, Zane Rowe. As Carl pointed out earlier, Zane has been a perfect fit since joining Workday last quarter, and I'm thrilled to have him on board. Over to you, Zane.\n\nZane Rowe\n\nnullChief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President\n\nThanks, Aneel. As this is my first earnings call as Workday's CFO, I want to start by saying how honored I am to partner alongside you, Aneel, Carl and all of our fellow Workmates around the globe. I joined Workday because I thought it was one of the most compelling opportunities in all of enterprise software. The continued strength we saw in Q2 further reinforces that belief.\nTurning to the quarter. Subscription revenue in Q2 was $1.62 billion, up 19% year-over-year. Professional services revenue was $163 million, leading to total revenue of $1.79 billion, growth of 16%. From a geographic perspective, total revenue outside the U.S. was $442 million, representing 25% of total revenue and 15% growth in Q2.\nAs Carl mentioned, we see significant long-term international growth opportunities, which we expect, over time, will become a more meaningful portion of our revenue mix. 24-month subscription revenue backlog was $10.27 billion at the end of Q2, up 23%, driven by new ACV bookings and strong renewals, with gross and net revenue retention rates of over 95% and over 100%, respectively.\nEarly renewals in the quarter exceeded our expectations and added roughly 1.5 points of growth to 24-month backlog. Total subscription revenue backlog at the end of the quarter was $17.85 billion, up 32%. Early renewals in the quarter added roughly 3 points to the growth. In addition, we continue to see longer contract duration on both net new deals and renewals, which speaks to our customers' continued commitment to our platform and is causing our total backlog growth to significantly outpace growth in the 24-month backlog.\nOur non-GAAP operating income for the second quarter was $421 million, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 23.6%. Margin strength relative to our guidance was driven by revenue outperformance and the timing of certain expenses. Q2 operating cash flow was $425 million, which benefited from the timing of collections in the quarter.\nDuring Q2, we repurchased $139 million in shares at an average price of $218.33 per share. And we had $287 million in remaining authorization under our buyback program as of quarter end. We ended the quarter with $6.7 billion in cash and marketable securities.\nWe continue to add key talents across strategic growth areas of the business, and we ended Q2 with nearly 17,900 global Workmates. We are pleased with our financial performance in Q2 and focused on continuing to drive results in the second half while investing to support longer-term growth.\nNow turning to guidance. Following our momentum in the first half of the year, we are raising our full year FY '24 subscription revenue guidance to a new range of $6.57 billion to $6.59 billion, representing 18% year-over-year growth. We expect Q3 subscription revenue to be $1.678 billion to $1.68 billion, representing 17% year-over-year growth. We're maintaining our FY '24 professional services revenue guidance of $630 million to $650 million as we continue to strategically shift more deployments to our partner ecosystem as part of our channel strategy.\nFor Q3, we expect professional services revenue of $165 million. We expect 24-month backlog to grow approximately 21% year-over-year in Q3. This includes our current outlook for early renewals in the quarter. We are raising our FY '24 non-GAAP operating margin guidance to 23.5% and plan on maintaining a disciplined approach of investing in long-term growth while we expand margins.\nFor Q3, we expect non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 23.5%. GAAP operating margins for the third quarter and the full year are expected to be approximately 20 and 22 percentage points lower than the non-GAAP margins, respectively. The FY '24 non-GAAP tax rate remains at 19%. We expect FY '24 operating cash flow of $1.95 billion, growth of 18% year-over-year.\nAs we mentioned last quarter, we anticipate making our first semiannual payment of our employee cash bonus plan in Q3, which impacts our annual cash flow and quarterly seasonality for FY '24. In addition, we continue to expect FY '24 capital expenditures of approximately $300 million.\nI'll close by thanking our terrific community of customers and partners for their continued support. And I look forward to seeing many of you in the investment community at our upcoming Financial Analyst Day on September 27 in San Francisco.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator to begin Q&A."

LLC\n\n-- to our results for the comparable period of our fiscal 2023. With that, I'll hand the call over to Aneel.\n\nAneel Bhusri\n\nCo-Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Workday, Inc.\n\nThank you, Justin, and welcome to Workday's first quarter fiscal '24 earnings call. I'm pleased to share that Workday reported strong Q1 results and once again outperformed against our key operating metrics, which include a subscription revenue growth of 20% for the quarter. While the macro environment continues to be unpredictable, we remain positive about our future growth prospects for a couple of reasons.\nFirst, we got the year off to a strong start and have built a healthy pipeline of opportunities which gives us better visibility into the rest of fiscal '24. And second, we are seeing the value proposition of the full Workday platform, combined with our unique approach to artificial intelligence and machine learning, continue to gain momentum as more and more organizations across geographies and industries put their trust in us to help them drive the future of work.\nWhen it comes to AI and ML, we think about implemented differently than any other enterprise software company in the world. And we've been at it for nearly a decade, while many of our competitors are scrambling to catch up. We approach AI and ML with a heavy emphasis on being human-centric, using these capabilities to augment people and organizations to make them more productive, better informed to make decisions, and to help them reduce business risk.\nSeveral things set us apart. One, AI and ML are embedded into the very core of our platform, allowing us to rapidly deliver and sustain new ML-infused capabilities into our products to drive more business value for our customers. \nTwo, we have the quantity and quality of data that further differentiates us, meaning that we not only have access to an enormous amount of data due to the more than 60 million users representing more than 600 billion transactions over the last year, but we also have a unified data model that allows us to build and train models in a way our competitors simply cannot replicate.\nAnd three, we firmly believe that to deliver on the possibilities it offers, AI and ML must be leveraged in a trustworthy and ethical way. Workday has always been a trusted partner to help companies keep their most critical assets, their people and money, safe, secure, and private. This approach becomes even more essential when leveraging AI and ML. As you know, generative AI is driving the AI and ML discussion right now. Despite the recent hype around large language models, Workday has been delivering AI and ML, including LLMs, for several years.\nWe believe we need to look past the hype cycle and identify the real ways our customers can extract business value from LLMs. Today, we're using generative AI tools behind the scenes to help power products like Workday Search and Skills Cloud, while exploring a variety of generative AI use cases for our customers. For example, we're looking at many content generation use cases within our Workday talent management, recruiting, financial management, and core HCM applications.\nAdditionally, for years, we have taken a leading role in AI-focused policy discussions at the federal, state, and local level in the U.S. while partnering with the European Union and other governments around the world to provide thoughtful and concrete policy approaches to responsible AI. Simply put, we believe AI technology should be regulated. This is an area that you will continue to hear more from us in future quarters, and I look forward to sharing updates about how Workday is helping to drive AI policy globally. \nMoving to our core set of applications, we continued our investment in Workday Peakon Employee Voice by recently unveiling semantic search capabilities, which leverages AI to analyze millions of employee comments and present the most meaningful insights. While manual keyword searches take hours or days, semantic search can analyze employee comments in seconds to quickly provide leaders with the insights they need to address emerging workplace trends.\nEmployee engagement is one of the biggest hot buttons for CEOs today, and we're continuing to see more organizations turn to Peakon to help them stay on top of and address employee sentiment. In fact, Peakon hit a significant milestone in Q1 as it surpassed more than 500 million total survey responses and 70 million written comments, providing us with one of the world's largest standardized data sets on employee sentiment.\n For the office of the CFO, we recently unveiled Predictive Forecaster, a capability within Workday Adaptive Planning that creates ML-based forecasts, with the ability to add additional regressors and data sets. The feature, which is in limited availability today, supports our next evolution of Workday Adaptive Planning to produce increasingly predictive plans and enhance insights to help organizations more effectively navigate today's business landscape. Another important innovation focus area for us is to be more open and connected, whether that's by providing an open and extensible platform or by working closely with our partners to deliver added value to our customers. \nFor our Workday platform, we are continuing to deliver tools and capabilities that simplify and enhance application development with Workday Extend. For example, we introduced our first set of ML APIs in Q1 to enable our Extend customers to build extensions that leverage ML.\nWe also released low-code/no-code development functionality with App Builder, enabling developers to create apps with Extend via a simple drag-and-drop user interface. And we built on our decade-plus partnership with AWS to create a native integration from Extend to AWS. With this integration, developers can easily and securely leverage AWS services in their Extend applications. The integration is in early access, with GA to follow later this year. Extend, which surpassed 500 customers in Q1, continues to be a major differentiator for us with the office of the CIO.\nAdditionally, we held Workday DevCon, our third annual developers conference, earlier this month. In-person attendance for this year's event grew by nearly 200% over last year, which is a testament to the excitement we're seeing from our customers and partners to build on top of the Workday platform, not only with Extend, but with Prism, Adaptive Planning, journeys, and integrations. And on the partner front, we recently announced an expansion of our partnership with Alight to deliver an integrated payroll experience to customers across six key regions for us in Europe: Benelux, Germany, Italy, the Nordics, Spain, and Switzerland.\nAs you know, Workday's core values are foundational to everything we do and guide the decisions we make. In recognition of our efforts to always strive to do what's right, I'm pleased to share that Workday for the third consecutive year was named one of the World's Most Ethical Companies by Ethisphere. Additionally, we continued our commitment to sustainability by joining Frontier, an advance market commitment to accelerate carbon removal. Finally, I want to note an organizational change that we will be making. After nearly nine years with Workday, Barbara Larson, our current CFO, is stepping away to spend more time with her family. During her time with Workday, Barbara has served in several senior leadership roles across our finance and product organizations and has played an integral role in shaping Workday into the company we are today. I'm extremely grateful for her friendship and for the countless contributions she has made to the company, and I wish her nothing but the best in her next endeavor.\nWith Barbara leaving, I'm pleased to announce that Zane Rowe will be joining Workday as our new CFO. Zane comes to us from VMware, where he was CFO since 2016, and before that held CFO roles at EMC and United Airlines. Carl and Zane worked together at VMware, so I'll let Carl share more in a minute on what Zane's addition to our leadership team will mean for Workday. In closing, we once again delivered a strong quarter and feel good about our growth prospects throughout the rest of fiscal year '24 despite what will continue to be a challenging macroeconomic environment. Innovation is core to who we are and fuels our continuing focus on infusing differentiated AI and ML across our entire product portfolio.\nDoing that will enable us to continue to serve as the digital backbone for organizations who want to thrive in today's changing world of work. With that, I'll turn it over to our co-CEO and my good friend, Carl Eschenbach, to share our go-to-market highlights from the quarter. Carl, over to you.\n\nCarl M. Eschenbach\n\nPresident & Chief Operating Officer, VMware, Inc.\n\nThanks, Aneel, and thank you, everyone, for joining today. I want to start by offering my sincere thanks to Barbara for all she has done for Workday in her nearly nine years here. As a board member and now as co-CEO, I've had the opportunity to watch her grow and help drive Workday forward across her many leadership roles.\nWithout question, Workday is a better company because of her. We will miss her, and we wish her well. As we search for a leader to take over as CFO, Aneel, the board, and I cannot think of a better person than Zane Rowe. I had the privilege of working alongside him at VMware, and I believe he is one of the finest executives and CFOs in all of enterprise software.\nAs we embark upon the next phase of our growth journey, Zane is the perfect person to guide us on our path of driving durable long-term growth and margin expansion. We are thrilled to welcome Zane to the team and expect a seamless transition over the next couple of months. Ninety days ago, at our global sales kickoff, we challenged our teams to deliver a strong start for FY '24. I'm proud to say that our work may met that goal, driving growth across key geographies, industries, and solutions, leading to strong new ACV growth in Q1. Because of their efforts, we are well positioned as we head into Q2 despite a challenging macro environment, which continues to cause customer uncertainty, increased scrutiny, and in some cases, lengthened sales cycles.\nI joined Workday as co-CEO six months ago. And while I was excited about the possibilities then, I am even more excited now. Sharing the co-CEO role with Aneel couldn't be going any better. Working alongside him, I've had the chance to witness the power of Aneel's 30 years of product experience, which is unmatched in our industry. Our complementary skills make a tremendous partnership.\nI've also spent a lot of time over the last few months meeting with our employees, customers, and partners around the world. These visits have shown me the energy and innovation across the Workday community firsthand. They've reinforced my belief that Workday has the potential to be one of the most enduring software businesses of our time. There are two key themes I keep hearing that sets us apart.\nThe first is that Workday is mission-critical. Workday is the intelligent digital backbone for enterprises who are looking to consolidate their technology footprint and move from best-of-breed applications to best in suite or best in platform.\nEnterprises are clearly looking to benefit from the reduced total cost of ownership and rapid pace of innovation that Workday delivers. Second, as Aneel mentioned, Workday's approach to AI and ML is a clear differentiator for us. With over 60 million users all on a unified data model, we are uniquely positioned to be the secure steady hand to support our customers through this tectonic technology shift, same as we did with cloud. Same as we did with cloud.\nTurning to highlights for the quarter, I would like to focus on five key areas: land, expand, global, industries, and partner. Our land motion with net new customers remains a primary driver of our growth. We had a strong performance landing new customers across our key buying centers, geographies, and industries in Q1 and continue to see significant runway.\nIn HCM, where we are the clear market leader, we saw sustained momentum with several new customer wins, including Dollar Tree, Interpublic Group, Johor Corporation, and McLane Company, along with notable HCM go-lives, including DICK'S Sporting Goods, J.Crew, and Lexmark International. Increasingly, customers are looking to leverage the full power of Workday by purchasing both HCM and Financial Management. New full platform wins in Q1 include IBEX Global Solutions, Pima County, the Rio, and Stevens Transport.\nWe also had several core FINs go-live, including Whole Foods, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, and Extendicare, which went live on both financials and HCM. Another way that we strategically bring new customers into the Workday community is through our planning first motion, which drove healthy growth and had important wins in every major region this quarter, including Leonardo Hotels, LeoVegas, and a significant expansion of our agreement with ExxonMobil. Planning is an important first step on our customer's digital transformation journey. And once they are a Workday customer, we can partner with them to realize the full benefits of our platform.\nSeveral companies expanded from planning first to full platform in Q1, including DJE Holdings and The Nature Conservancy. Given this success, along with momentum we are seeing within the office of the CFO, we are adding significant sales capacity this year, focus on selling FINs. And while this is early, we are optimistic about the initial pipeline momentum from these resources. Customers are increasingly leaning into Workday as their trusted platform across the board.\nThis was reflected in strong renewals and healthy expansion activity across our installed base in Q1. Wins include Brown & Brown, IU Group, Nissan, and RaceTrac, to name a few. We are seeing expansion momentum across our product portfolio, including solutions that deliver faster time to value for customers such as Peakon, Planning, Help, and Talent Optimization. This momentum is helping our sales teams create and close a healthy amount of pipeline, all in the same quarter.\nGlobal growth continues to be a massive untapped opportunity for us. We drove strong execution across a number of our major geographies this quarter, yet less than 5% of our TAM is penetrated. In the U.S., we saw strong traction, particularly within large enterprise. In EMEA, we're seeing early signs that our new leadership team is coming together, with healthy growth across key markets, including Germany, Switzerland, and the Nordics, and wins, including Equinor, ASA, and Clyde & Co. In APJ, Australia was a highlight, with wins including Insignia Financial and the Australian arm of Tokio Marine.\nMomentum is also clearly building within our investment in native payroll in the Australian market. While we still have work to do in APJ to capture the full market potential, after spending time in the region in Q1, the executive team and I continue to see a lot of opportunity. Next, I want to highlight our industry-first approach, which is a critical part of winning the offices of the CFO and CHRO within our core services-based industries.\nIn higher education, for example, we have led the market over the last three years in cloud-native HCM, financial, and Student systems, according to The Tambellini Group. We saw continued momentum in Q1, with notable wins, including a FINs expansion at Northeastern University and new platform wins at the University of Richmond and Loyola University of Maryland. In the professional services industry, C wins I mentioned earlier include deals at DJE Holdings, IBEX, and Interpublic Group. In financial services, we had several wins and expansions, including Absa Bank, Fannie Mae, and First American.\nIn state and local government, we followed up a strong Q4 with another quarter of healthy growth. And in healthcare, we were pleased to be named the top-performing cloud ERP solution by KLAS Research, and we had important Q1 wins, including a significant expansion at Stamford healthcare. Our ability to accelerate our momentum in these industries and across our business depends on our ability to maintain a vibrant and engaged partner ecosystem. While our partner ecosystem has always been critical to our success, we are shifting even more deployments to our partners.\nAnd in return, we are looking to work with our partners in increasingly strategic ways to drive more co-innovation and greater lead generation for Workday. As part of that effort, we rolled out our new partner referral program in May, which puts clear incentives in place for our ecosystem to drive lead generation. In addition, following our go-to-market partnership with AWS we announced last quarter, I'm pleased to share that we had our first AWS private marketplace transaction during Q1. And as Aneel mentioned, the recently announced payroll partnership with Alight expands our global payroll coverage.\nIn closing, we're off to a great start in FY '24, with strong new business bookings, healthy pipelines, and continued progress toward our strategic growth initiatives. And while the macro remains uncertain, we are positioning the business to return to 20%-plus subscription revenue growth when the environment improves and laying the foundation for driving durable growth in margin expansion for many years to come. With that, I'll turn it over to Barbara. Barbara, over to you.\n\nBarbara Larson\n\nGeneral Manager, Financial Management, Workday, Inc.\n\nThanks, Carl. I appreciate the kind words. It's been such a pleasure to work and grow alongside you, Aneel, and this entire organization these last nine years. But after much thought, I know this is the right time for me to step back and focus on my family. And I can't think of a better person to pass the CFO reins to than Zane. He's a remarkable leader, an incredible person and culture fit, and the right person to take Workday on the next phase of its incredible growth journey.\nI look forward to working with him over the next couple of months to ensure a seamless transition. As Aneel and Carl mentioned, we had a strong start to the year, driven by solid execution and durable demand across our solutions as organizations continue their finance and HR modernization journeys.\nSubscription revenue in Q1 was 1.53 billion, up 20% year over year. Professional services revenue in the quarter was 156 million. Total revenue outside of the U.S. was 420 million in Q1, representing 25% of total revenue. Twenty-four-month subscription revenue backlog was 9.79 billion, up 23% at the end of Q1, resulting from strong new ACV bookings and renewals, with gross and net revenue retention rates over 95% and over 100%, respectively.\nAs Carl mentioned, we saw significant customer base expansion activity in the quarter. Many of the customers that expanded their strategic footprint elected to co-term and renew their existing contracts ahead of schedule. These early renewals in the quarter added roughly 1 percentage point to both 24 months and total backlog growth.\nTotal subscription revenue backlog at the end of Q1 was 16.65 billion, up 32%. In addition to the benefit from early renewals, we continue to see increased average contract duration on both new deals and renewals, causing total backlog to grow significantly faster than 24 months backlog. Our non-GAAP operating income for the first quarter was $396 million, resulting in non-GAAP operating margin of 23.5%.\nMargin overachievement was driven by revenue upside, a slower-than-anticipated ramp in hiring, and the timing of certain expenses. Q1 operating cash flow was 277 million. As we discussed last quarter, the year-over-year decline was driven by the first full year payout of our performance-based cash bonus program, a $55 million interest payment on our debt, and payments associated with our January workforce realignment.\nWe ended the first quarter with more than 17,800 global workmates. We continue to add key talent across strategic growth areas of the business, notably go to market and product and technology, but we continue to plan for fewer headcount additions in FY '24 as compared to FY '23. Overall, we're very proud of the strong companywide execution in Q1, and we are focused on maintaining our momentum as we enter Q2.\nNow, turning to guidance, which reflects both the continued momentum of our business while also balancing what remains an uncertain macro environment. Following a strong Q1, we are raising the low end of our FY '24 subscription revenue guidance, resulting in a new range of 6.550 billion to 6.575 billion, an 18% year-over-year growth. We continue to view this guidance as prudent in the context of the environment.\nWe expect Q2 subscription revenue to be 1.611 billion to 1.613 billion, representing 18% year-over-year growth. Additionally, we continue to expect sequential subscription revenue growth in Q3 of approximately 4%. We are maintaining our FY '24 professional services revenue guidance of 630 million to 650 million. \nAs Carl mentioned, we are strategically shifting more deployments to our partner ecosystem as part of our channel strategy. For Q2, we expect professional services revenue of 160 million. We expect 24-month backlog to increase approximately 20% year-over-year in Q2. We continue to expect FY '24 non-GAAP operating margin of 23% and plan on maintaining a disciplined approach to investing in long-term growth opportunities while, at the same time, delivering healthy margin expansion. For Q2, we expect a non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 22%, which reflects typical seasonality as a result of our annual employee compensation cycle, which took effect at the beginning of Q2.\nGAAP operating margins for both the second quarter and the full year are expected to be approximately 22 percentage points lower than the non-GAAP margins. We expect to achieve GAAP profitability on an operating income basis beginning in the third quarter and for the full fiscal year as we continue to drive margin expansion and reduce stock-based compensation as a percentage of revenue. The FY '24 non-GAAP tax rate remains at 19%. To align our compensation plan with our focus on speed of execution and results, we recently modified our cash bonus program from an annual to a semiannual payout structure, beginning with our FY '24 bonus plan.\nWe expect to make the first semiannual payment in Q3 of this year, resulting in an additional bonus payment in FY '24 versus our initial expectations. As a result, we now expect FY '24 operating cash flow of 1.95 billion, growth of 18% year over year. In addition, we are lowering our guidance for FY '24 capital expenditures to approximately 300 million, driven by normalization we are seeing within our supply chain. We have 425 million in the remaining authorization under our buyback program and expect to resume buying back shares in Q2 after our trading window opens.\nAnd finally, I'll close by thanking our amazing employees, customers, and partners for their continued support and hard work as we move through FY '24 and beyond. With that, I'll turn it over to the operator to begin Q&A."

[Operator Instructions] I will now hand it over to Justin Furby, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.\n\nJustin Allen Furby\n\nResearch Analyst, William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division\n\nWelcome to Workday's First Quarter Fiscal 2025 Earnings Conference Call. On the call, we have Carl Eschenbach, our CEO; Zane Rowe, our CFO; Doug Robinson, our Co-President; and David Somers, our Chief Product Officer. Following prepared remarks, we will take questions. Our press release was issued after close of market and is posted on our website, where this call is being simultaneously webcast.\nBefore we get started, we want to emphasize that some of our statements on this call, particularly our guidance, are based on the information we have as of today and include forward-looking statements regarding our financial results, applications, customer demand, operations and other matters. These statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to the press release and the risk factors and documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our fiscal 2024 annual report on Form 10-K for additional information on risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in such statements.\nIn addition, during today's call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are useful as supplemental measures of Workday's performance. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to and not as a substitute for or in isolation from GAAP results. You can find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations with comparable GAAP results in our earnings press release, in our investor presentation and on the Investor Relations page of our website. The webcast replay of this call will be available for the next 90 days on our company website under the Investor Relations link.\nAdditionally, our quarterly investor presentation will be posted on our Investor Relations website following this call. Also, the Customers page of our website includes a list of selected customers and is updated monthly. Our second quarter fiscal 2025 quiet period begins on July 15, 2024. Unless otherwise stated, all financial comparisons in this call will be to our results for the comparable period of our fiscal 2024. With that, I'll hand the call over to Carl.\n\nCarl M. Eschenbach\n\nPresident & Chief Operating Officer, VMware, Inc.\n\nThank you, Justin, and thank you all for joining us today. I'm pleased to report our solid financial performance for the quarter, including 19% subscription revenue growth, 18% 12-month backlog growth, and non-GAAP operating margin of 26%. Over the past 6 quarters, we've made several key investments across the business as well as important organizational changes to set the foundation for durable growth and continued margin expansion.\nIn Q1, we continued to build on a number of important growth initiatives, including go-to-market changes that will help us further expand our total addressable market. And in the quarter, we closed several strategic deals, including a landmark federal win at the Defense Intelligence Agency. We also held our annual Innovation Summit, where we hosted 25 industry analysts and showcased our organic innovation engine, which continues to be one of the key strengths of our company. We already are seeing tremendous feedback from the event with lots of positive industry analyst coverage on the product road maps and the future of Workday.\nOur first quarter is always our seasonally slowest. We had clear areas of outperformance, including health care, public sector and continued strength in financials and full platform wins, but we also closed fewer large deals than last Q1, notably in EMEA. When purchase decisions are being made, our win rates remain strong. But within the quarter, we experienced increased deal scrutiny as compared to prior quarters, and we are seeing customers committing to lower headcount levels on renewals compared to what we had expected. We expect these dynamics to persist in the near term, which is reflected in our revised FY '25 subscription revenue guidance. While we can't control the macro, we are focusing on what's in our control, and that is innovation, scaling our go-to-market and partner ecosystem and delivering customer value.\nWe remain confident we're doing the right things to build a long-term durable business with balanced growth and margin expansion. With the emergence of AI, the shifting talent landscape, and pressure to realize operational efficiencies, organizations across geographies and industries are turning to Workday as their trusted platform to elevate humans and supercharge work. We made several key developments in Q1 that strengthen our position, and I'll share a few highlights.\nLet's start with customers. Our customers truly bring the power of Workday to life. A great example is our new partnership with the Defense Intelligence Agency. The DIA is the key intelligent agency for national defense in the United States. Workday will support the DIA on its mission to rapidly accelerate recruitment and onboarding efforts and create a diverse, trusted, and agile workforce. With Workday, they'll be able to identify, integrate, and direct skills and expertise to solve emerging intelligence problems when and where they are most needed.\nNot only is this a significant new win, but more importantly, it unlocks an incredible market opportunity for Workday in the federal government, and we expect it to increase our pipeline over the coming quarters. In fact, the DIA was on stage at our Federal Forum event in Washington, D.C. yesterday discussing digital transformation in the government. Now in its second year, the forum drew a record crowd of over 600 decision-makers across more than 70 agencies from the world of government and policy. This is up 100% from our Federal Forum last year, and the momentum we are building here is exciting.\nAnd speaking of momentum, we continue to take share in financials, bolstered by our go-to-market and platform investments combined with our compelling value proposition of having a single secure platform to manage both your people and money. In Q1, new Financial Management customers and full platform customers both increased more than 20% over Q1 of last year. And more than 90% of our nearly 2,000 FINS customers are now leveraging the power of our HCM platform as well.\nIn Q1, we added several full platform HCM and FINS customers, including Baptist Health, Covenant Health Systems, the City of Milwaukee, and Owning Group, the largest privately held staffing company in the U.S. We also had a number of expansions within the office of the CFO, including Alliance Bernstein, Hospital Sisters Health System and John Muir Health. During Q1, we also expanded our leadership in HCM, adding new relationships with organizations, including ALS Group USA, Carhartt, and one of the largest P&C insurers in the world, which expanded its core financials footprint to add HCM.\nAnd we had several strategic HCM expansions and renewals, including ING Bank, Sandvik AB, and Valeo Management Services. Beyond the wins, we celebrate when our customers go live on our platform. In Q1, Asda, Electrolux, Topgolf, county of Richland, Apex Group, and LVHN all successfully went live on Workday.\nCustomers trust Workday to help them navigate huge transformations. They did so with the cloud, and now they're turning to us to help them responsibly leverage AI to drive productivity, efficiency, and cost savings. Workday gives them the ultimate advantage. We've been delivering AI capabilities to our customers for nearly a decade. We fill AI into the core of our platform, which means AI features and functionality are embedded natively in all of our applications.\nAnd with more than 65 million users generating more than 800 billion transactions per year on our platform, the volume of clean, trusted data that Workday and our ecosystem can leverage for AI is truly unmatched. We continue to make significant investments to further enhance our leadership in this area and deliver trusted and responsible AI innovations that drive meaningful business results. We now have more than 50 AI use cases live in production and 25 generative AI use cases on our road map to help our customers make confident decisions faster, increase efficiencies, and make their people more productive.\nIn Q1, several new innovations went live for early access customers, including AI-powered content generation capabilities with growth plans, job descriptions, and knowledge-based articles. These automate repetitive tasks and put information in the hands of the right people faster. We also released AI-enabled Payroll Insights, which help payroll professionals detect anomalies faster and more accurately to save money and reduce risk. Perhaps the best example here is our talent optimization solution, which leverages Workday Skills Cloud. This is an AI-first SKU where we have seen strong attach rates on new deals and have significant momentum selling back to our customer base as well. I'm pleased to share that over half of our core customer base has now licensed this product, making it one of our fastest-growing ever.\nContinuing to accelerate our AI road map, we closed the acquisition of HiredScore in Q1, giving us a comprehensive AI-powered talent acquisition and internal mobility offering. Our shared customers are realizing a 25% increase in recruiter capacity with AI, one of the many reasons we're so excited about this combination. We closed our first joint deal this quarter and we're rapidly building pipeline, particularly across our base of more than 4,000 recruiting customers.\nThe power of Workday is our platform, and that gives us a ton of flexibility to fuel growth, for example, in industries. This is a key foundational element and a major differentiator for us. We've been focusing on deepening our purpose-built offerings in key verticals, including health care, public sector, financial services, and professional services. As you can see in the logos from this quarter, health care once again performed very well with new ACV growth exceeding 50% in Q1. At the same time, our professional and business services vertical is already well on its way to eclipsing $1 billion in annual recurring revenue.\nIn Q1, we released a natively-built configure price quote solution for services businesses, which integrates with CRM platforms to streamline the quoting process. Our research shows that for 95% of our customers, quoting is still happening in spreadsheets today so this is going to significantly increase their efficiencies.\nPublic sector was another highlight in Q1. In addition to the DIA, we continued to excel in state and local government, closing full platform wins with the cities of north Las Vegas, Milwaukee, and Palm Bay and Monroe and Washington counties. And in education, we had a record number of Workday Student go-lives in Q1 and now have taken 20 new customers live so far this year, including Iowa State University, University of Arkansas System, and Wake Forest University.\nGlobal expansion continues to be a key growth driver for Workday. We're focused on investing at all levels to build our regional businesses with local leadership, go-to-market, and product enhancements. For instance, this quarter, our native payroll solution for customers in Australia became generally available. And our global payroll platform is now available for early adopters as we extend the power of Workday with strategic partners like ADP, Alight, and more. On the go-to-market side, we began holding Workday Elevate events across APAC, Japan, and EMEA in Q1 and will continue throughout Q2. These events bring together thousands of prospects and customers, generating new pipeline and deepening our existing relationships.\nAnd just last week, we announced our plans to invest more than GBP 550 million in our U.K. operations over the next 3 years. We also announced that in early 2025, our customers will be able to access our core HCM financials and adapt the planning solutions locally on the AWS Cloud in the U.K. Not only are we enabling compliance with data residency requirements, we're also boosting performance and helping businesses scale for the future. So as you can see, we're continuing to invest for our growth, and I'm energized by how we'll be able to empower more U.K. organizations with the power of our platform.\nAnd while it was a more challenging quarter in some of our international markets, we saw strength in France, the Netherlands, and Japan. Key international wins in Q1 included OCP Group, Knight Frank, and Aman Resorts. Our partner ecosystem is a powerful driver of customer success, and it continues to grow in both breadth and depth. Across the board, we're seeing continued growth in our referral and co-selling efforts, with our partner sourcing more pipeline and closing more ACV in Q1 than all of FY '24 through our sales program. This points to increasing ecosystem-led growth, which is a key priority.\nWe have over 200 co-sell and referral partnerships that are helping expand our routes to market. One of the partners that we signed in Q1 that I'm particularly excited about is Google. Under our new partnership, GCP customers will have access to Workday products through the Google Cloud Marketplace. We're off to a fast start and we expect to have our first transaction via the Marketplace this month.\nWe also recently expanded our relationship with AWS to include co-innovation across industries and enhance go-to-market investments. We bill over $75 million of active ACV pipeline with AWS and the expanded partnership should only accelerate that. And in Q1, we formed a new reseller agreement with Kyriba that enables Workday customers to integrate with a network of over 1,000 global banks. This dramatically reduces the time, complexity, and costs needed to integrate and adapt with changing banking requirements.\nPartners are critical to helping us accelerate and broaden our innovation footprint. In 2 weeks, we'll welcome 1,200 partners and customers to Las Vegas for DevCon, our annual Developer Conference. DevCon, as well as our developer ecosystem, has grown by more than 50% since last year, which is a testament to the momentum we're building across our platform. At the event, we'll be announcing new ways for partners to build, distribute, and monetize their applications on the Workday platform. We are also launching several other components of the program to enable us to embed partner solutions within Workday in ways we've never done before.\nWith our cloud-native platform in Workday Extend, we are enabling AI innovation not just from Workday but our customers and partners as well. We now have more than 900 Extend customers and 1,600 apps delivering significant value across our ecosystem of customers and partners. Workday Extend Pro, which includes AI Gateway as well as Developer Copilot launching later this year, enables our customers and partners to build AI-first apps that leverage the power of our platform.\nThere is clearly an appetite to build AI-first apps on top of Workday. More than 50% of our Q1 Extend ACV was from Extend Pro, making it another one of our fastest-growing SKUs. And our AI Marketplace, which is going live next month, gives our customers access to the best of Workday AI and solutions from third-party partners together in 1 place. These are just a few of the latest examples of the breadth of our innovation and the reach of our platform.\nNow to close, as I've said many times, we have a durable business with multiple levers to drive long-term growth. With our leadership and investment in AI, our unique ability to address organizations' most critical challenges and the deep relationships we have with our customers and partners, Workday remains well positioned to extend our market leadership. This is exactly what drew me to Workday and what continues to excite me.\nWe also have a diverse business serving more than 10,500 customers across industries, which now includes more than 60% of the Fortune 500, an incredible milestone and a testament to the strategic nature of our platform. And yet, we're just getting started, with more than 40,000 organizations in our addressable market and a continued opportunity to expand our footprint and deliver even more value within our existing customer base. Moving into Q2, we are well positioned to achieve our objectives in the near term while continuing to build for the long term. I'd like to thank our customers who put their trust in us, our partners, and especially my 19,400 Workmates around the world for helping drive Workday forward. With that, I'll hand it over to Zane.\n\nZane C. Rowe\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, VMware, Inc.\n\nThanks, Carl, and thank you to everyone for joining today's call. Our Q1 performance was in line with our expectations across our key financial metrics. Subscription revenue in the first quarter was $1.815 billion, up 19%, including a 1 point benefit from the leap year. Professional services revenue was $175 million in the quarter, leading to total revenue in Q1 of $1.99 billion, growing 18%. U.S. revenue in Q1 totaled $1.49 billion, and international revenue totaled $497 million, both growing 18%.\n12-month subscription revenue backlog, or CRPO, was $6.6 billion at the end of Q1, representing growth of 18%. Renewal volume in the quarter, including early renewals, was in line with our expectations. Gross and net revenue retention rates remained strong at over 95% and over 100%, respectively. Total subscription revenue backlog at the end of the quarter was $20.68 billion, up 24%. Our non-GAAP operating income for the first quarter was $515 million, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 25.9%. Margin strength was driven by moderate revenue outperformance and lower expenses.\nQ1 operating cash flow was $372 million, growth of 34%. During Q1, we repurchased $134 million of our shares at an average price of $267.09 per share. In addition, starting in April, we began to fund withholding taxes due on employee equity awards by net share withholding. This reduced our dilution by 1 million shares in the quarter relative to our prior sell-to-cover method and impacted our cash flow from financing by $239 million in Q1. We ended the quarter with $7.2 billion in cash and marketable securities.\nAs of April 30, headcount stood at over 19,400 Workmates around the globe. We were pleased to see the continued progress across our key growth initiatives, including momentum in full platform wins and continued ramping of our partner ecosystem, which we expect to support growth in the coming years. At the same time, we experienced elevated scrutiny in our sales cycle, particularly in EMEA. Within our customer base, we continue to see expansion, primarily through product add-ons versus customer headcount growth, which has slowed relative to our expectations.\nTaking these factors into account, we are updating our full year FY '25 subscription revenue guidance to $7.7 billion to $7.725 billion, representing growth of approximately 17% compared to our previous guided range of 17% to 18%. We expect Q2 FY '25 subscription revenue to be $1.895 billion, representing 17% growth. We now expect FY '25 professional services revenue of approximately $650 million to $660 million, reflecting the Q1 outperformance and our Q2 expectations along with our strategy of further leveraging our partner ecosystem. For Q2, we expect professional services revenue of $175 million.\nTurning to backlog. As we've highlighted previously, CRPO growth is influenced by quarter-to-quarter variability in renewal volume and new business bookings. The strength in overall renewal activity in FY '24, including early renewals, caused our CRPO growth to outpace subscription revenue growth throughout last year. This aggregate effect is impacting our backlog growth this year. In Q2, as we saw in Q1, we expect CRPO growth to be below subscription revenue growth impacted by the cumulative headwind from last year's strong renewal activity. In Q2, we expect CRPO to increase between 15% and 16%.\nWe continue to see momentum across our core growth areas and are continuing to invest for future growth while driving increased efficiencies across the company. We now expect FY '25 non-GAAP operating margins of approximately 25%. For Q2, we expect non-GAAP operating margin of 24.5%, which reflects our typical seasonality. GAAP operating margins for the second quarter and full year are expected to be approximately 20 and 21 percentage points lower than the non-GAAP margins, respectively. The FY '25 non-GAAP tax rate remains at 19%. We continue to expect FY '25 operating cash flow of $2.25 billion and capital expenditures of approximately $330 million.\nIn closing, I want to reiterate our commitment to investing to support long-term growth while expanding margins. We continue to see strong customer demand and engagement across our platform, supporting our financial targets and helping drive our strategic growth initiatives. With that, I'll turn it back over to the operator to begin Q&A."

[Operator Instructions] I will now hand it over to Justin Furby, Vice President of Investor Relations.\n\nJustin Furby\n\nAnalyst, William Blair & Co. LLC\n\nThank you, operator. Welcome to Workday's Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2024 Earnings Conference Call. On the call, we have Carl Eschenbach, our CEO; Aneel Bhusri, our Executive Chair; Zane Rowe, our CFO; and Doug Robinson, our Co-President. Following prepared remarks, we will take questions. Our press release was issued after close of market and is posted on our website where this call is being simultaneously webcast.\nBefore we get started, we want to emphasize that some of our statements on this call, particularly our guidance, are based on the information we have as of today and include forward-looking statements regarding our financial results, applications, customer demand, operations and other matters. These statements are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to the press release and the risk factors and documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our fiscal 2023 annual report on Form 10-K and our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q for additional information on risks, uncertainties and assumptions that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in such statements.\nIn addition, during today's call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are useful as supplemental measures of Workday's performance. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to and not as a substitute for or in isolation from GAAP results. You can find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations with comparable GAAP results in our earnings press release, in our investor presentation and on the Investor Relations page of our website.\nThe webcast replay of this call will be available for the next 90 days on our company website under the Investor Relations link. Additionally, our quarterly investor presentation will be posted on our Investor Relations website following this call. Also, the Customers page of our website includes a list of selected customers and is updated monthly.\nOur first quarter fiscal 2025 quiet period begins on April 15, 2024. Unless otherwise stated, all financial comparisons in this call will be to our results for the comparable period of our fiscal 2023. With that, I'll hand the call over to Carl.\n\nCarl Eschenbach\n\nChief Operating Officer and Co-President, VMware, Inc.\n\nThank you, Justin, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. I'm pleased to share that Workday delivered a solid Q4, achieving 18% subscription revenue growth and a non-GAAP operating margin of 24%. These results were driven by momentum across the business and capped off a year of strong execution by our nearly 19,000 Workmates across the globe. Over the course of the last year, we've made key investments across our leadership team, go-to-market and partner ecosystem and our platform, positioning us to drive enduring growth in FY '25 and beyond.\nI couldn't be prouder of what we've accomplished over the last year, particularly in an environment where deal scrutiny remains high. I'd like to thank our customers, partners and especially my fellow Workmates for making these results possible. My belief in the opportunity ahead for Workday and our value proposition has only gotten stronger in the 14 months since I've joined. With the emergence of AI, shifting talent landscape and pressure to realize operational efficiencies, leaders are turning to Workday as their trusted platform to manage their most critical assets, their people and their money.\nCustomers have come to trust us with helping them navigate these huge transformations from the cloud to AI. In fact, the theme of building trust took center stage at the World Economic Forum annual meeting in Davos last month. Throughout my conversations, it was clear to me that leaders see the business benefits of implementing AI, but they also recognize building trust is key. Workday stands apart in our commitment to the responsible development of AI technologies, its responsible deployment within our own company and our advocacy for its regulation. We've been delivering AI capabilities to our customers for nearly a decade, building AI into the core of our platform, and we're making significant investments to further enhance our leadership in this area.\nWorkday Skills Cloud, for example, uses AI to gain insights into an organization's current skills and identifies skills needed for the future, allowing for smarter decisions about talent across the company. In our upcoming R1 release, many of the generative AI use cases we showcased at Rising will be put into the hands of early adopters, including job descriptions and knowledge articles. To further accelerate our AI road map, today, we're excited to announce our planned acquisition of HiredScore, which provides AI-powered talent orchestration solutions. HiredScore's technology delivers data-driven insights to help improve recruiting and internal mobility processes.\nThe combination of our data set in Workday Skills Cloud with HiredScore's solution will provide customers with a transparent, AI-powered talent acquisition and internal mobility offering. Not only is it technology compelling, but HiredScore and Workday share a commitment to responsible AI development, including a focus on explainability and transparency. We are absolutely thrilled about the potential of what we can do together.\nNow let's move into the performance from the quarter, which reflects the diversity and durability of Workday's business. As we shared at our Financial Analyst Day, our net new business is driven by a balanced mix of new customer wins and expansions within our installed base, which speaks to the significant opportunity that we have ahead. From a net new customer perspective, we once again saw strength in full platform deals. We welcomed customers like Australian Stock Exchange, Boyd Gaming Corporation, HHS, Randstad, UHS of Delaware and VXI Global Solutions as full platform HCM and Financials customers. And new HCM customers this quarter included Crane Company, El Corte Inglés, Hitachi Astemo, Hungry Jack's, Kohler Co., [ Own Say ] and Swisscom.\nAlongside healthy net new customer activity, our customer base team again delivered in Q4. We had several strategic expansions and renewals in the quarter, including BJ's, Goodyear and Greystar Global Enterprise. And we had a number of core Financial Management expansions across our HCM customer base, including Allied Financial, Huntington Bank, Intermountain Health and Stewart Title Guaranty. Our create and close motion also had another great quarter and is becoming an important driver of our customer-based sales team's growth.\nFrom a solutions perspective, we saw healthy uptake across our portfolio, including Extend, where new ACV doubled year-over-year in Q4. We now have more than 850 Extend customers, and I'm pleased to share that roughly 1/3 of our Extend new ACV signed in Q4 was from our new professional SKU, which includes AI Gateway as well as Workday Developer Copilot launching later this year. Beyond the wins we celebrate when our customers go live on our platform and I'm pleased to share that in FY '24, over 95% of our deployments went live on time. In Q4, we had several strategic HCM deployments, including AT&T, Northern Trust and Whataburger, alongside notable Financial Management go-lives, including American University, Sagility Operations and UMass Memorial Health.\nTo propel our land and expand business, we continue to invest in several growth areas. I'll share a few highlights from those areas now, starting with international. Today, international represents over half of our addressable opportunity yet is 1/4 of our revenues. We're working to change that, and we're seeing early signs of progress. In EMEA, our leadership additions continue to drive improved and more consistent results. I spent a couple of weeks visiting our teams in Europe this past quarter, and I have to tell you, I am fired up by the momentum we're building.\nIn Q4, our teams once again delivered healthy new ACV growth across key markets such as the U.K., Spain and France. We also closed our first deal in EMEA with our Alight co-sell partnership, and we continue to build pipeline with important partnerships alongside ADP and Alight in addition to our broader referral and co-sell ecosystem.\nIn the Asia Pacific region, Australia delivered once again, and I'm pleased to share that Japan, which is a key investment priority, drove strong new ACV growth in Q4. While it's still early days for us in this market, we're focused on growing it. To help lead the way, I'm delighted to welcome Chikara Furuichi as our new leader of the Japanese market to help us win in one of the world's largest economies. Chikara brings over 25 years of experience in both SaaS security and cloud services from across Japan and APAC. He reports directly to Patrick Blair, our President of Global Sales.\nMoving to financials. We're seeing continued proof that our go-to-market and platform investments are paying off with healthy growth in core financials customers and new ACV and a robust pipeline looking forward. We drove a record number of new full platform wins in both Q4 and FY '24, and our industry approach is a clear driver of this momentum. Health care, for example, again grew new ACV over 50% in Q4, capping off a fantastic FY '24. Our innovation in key areas such as supply chain is differentiating us in the market and is driving industry awards such as the recent recognition in best-of-class in enterprise resource planning for the seventh year in a row.\nWe're also pleased to share that Gartner named Workday a leader in the 2023 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Financial Planning Software for the second time since the category's inception last year. Our education and government teams also drove continued success in FY '24, and higher ed was a standout in Q4 with a number of full platform wins, including Oregon State University, Portland Community College and the College of William and Mary.\nAnd to help accelerate our trajectory in the U.S. Federal business, I'm delighted to welcome Lynn Martin as our new federal leader. Lynn has more than 30 years' experience in the public sector, most recently running Google's U.S. federal business and before that, running VMware's public sector team for close to a decade.\nSupporting our progress around many of these investment areas is our partner ecosystem where our focus is delivering customer outcomes, growing our business through referrals and co-selling and building differentiated solutions. During Q4, we announced a strategic partnership with Insperity that delivers on all 3 of these priorities. Through this partnership, Workday will become the platform powering Insperity's PEO service for SMB organizations, effectively opening up a new market opportunity for us. It's a terrific example of how we're innovating our go-to-market strategy to drive growth.\nAnother great example is the Spark&Grow offering, which we launched with Kainos. It helps our emerging and medium enterprise customers to go live on Workday in less than 4 weeks. We've seen incredible demand for this offering, and we're just getting started.\nThese are 2 great examples of momentum that is building across our ecosystem, which I'm pleased to share now includes more than 200 partners that have been onboarded to refer new sales leads and co-sell with us. We launched this pilot program last May and we've seen momentum building throughout the year with a nice uptick in Q4 partner-driven pipeline generation.\nIn closing, I'm incredibly proud of our team's strong execution throughout FY '24, all while navigating a dynamic environment and embracing important changes we've rolled out across the business. We enter FY '25 with a strong foundation and a clear strategy to support durable growth while at the same time continuing to drive efficiencies across the business. As I said on my first Workday earnings call 1 year ago, we have the opportunity to be one of the largest, most enduring and profitable software businesses of our time. I've never been more convinced in that belief.\nBefore I turn the call over, I'd like to take a minute to acknowledge Aneel, who recently moved into a new role as Executive Chair. Aneel, it has been an incredible 14 months, and I'm truly grateful for your partnership and the trust you put in me to lead what you and Dave started nearly 19 years ago. Your technology vision and your commitment to Workday's special culture and values have put this company in an incredible position. I am excited for what we'll achieve together next. Thank you for continuing to be in my corner not just in guiding the applications and platform development but also as a friend. Aneel, over to you.\n\nAneel Bhusri\n\nCo-Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Workday, Inc.\n\nThank you, Carl, and to everyone joining today's call. As Carl highlighted, we are continuing to see solid momentum across the business, fueled in large part by our ability to deliver the innovation our customers need to thrive in today's fast-paced and dynamic environment. There is no doubt that more and more organizations, spanning midsize to large enterprises, are seeing the increasing value in building their businesses upon the Workday platform with AI at its core.\nEarlier this month, we officially named Carl sole CEO of Workday while I assumed the role of Executive Chair. As I've said before, there is no better person than Carl to lead Workday through this next chapter of growth. He has already made a tremendous impact on the business from day 1. And thanks to his leadership, we are already successfully executing on several key growth initiatives and strategies that he put in place. Furthermore, and most importantly, Carl perfectly aligns with our values-driven approach, and I can't wait to see what the future holds for us with him at the helm.\nAs Executive Chair, I'll remain actively involved but with an emphasis on my true passion as a technologist. Together with our Co-President, Sayan Chakraborty, and the rest of our amazing product and technology organization, I will focus on guiding the future direction of Workday's applications and technology platform while staying close to our Workmates and our customers.\nHow we evolve and expand the Workday platform in the coming years will be critical to our continued growth and scale. To help us do that, we have identified several core elements of our innovation strategy that we plan on building out over the next 12 to 18 months. The first is a continued focus on evolving our Financial Management and HCM applications so that we can further empower the offices of finance and HR to optimize their 2 most important assets, their people and their money.\nNext is AI. Fueled by our 10-year head start and unique approach to building AI directly into the core, we will continue to responsibly deliver new ML models that solve real business problems for our customers and enable their employees. We'll also incorporate high-value generative AI capabilities to enhance search, understand historical context, make recommendations and create content. Additionally, I'm incredibly excited about bringing HiredScore into the fold and how we'll further strengthen our overall AI capabilities.\nThird is industry, with an emphasis on deepening our offerings in retail and hospitality, education and government along with financial services, health care, professional services and tech and media. Extensibility is another important focus area so that we can enable IT teams to build and maintain integrations between Workday and third-party systems, ultimately extending the value of our platform. Our new Extend AI Gateway, which we announced at Rising last year, is a perfect example of the type of work we are focused on here.\nFifth is experiences. Delivering persona-tailored experiences empowers high-performing employees and teams for maximum productivity. Manager Insights Hub and Flex Teams, which we also unveiled at Rising, are just a few of the ways we've already been delivering enhanced experiences for managers.\nThe final area of investment is security and resiliency, which is foundational to everything we do. With more than 10,000 organizations depending on Workday to help run their businesses, it's essential that we design to protect the resilience and performance of critical processes, safeguard against the growing number of global cybersecurity threats and increase our investment in public cloud offerings to drive greater performance, scalability and security for our customers.\nWe're also investing in our long-term innovation strategy by continuing to strengthen our product and technology leadership team. I'm pleased to share that David Somers has been appointed as our new Chief Product Officer and will lead development across our full suite of products. David, who will continue to report into Sayan, has been instrumental in leading our HR product strategy and development in the last few years, and I'm excited that he will be helping to lead our efforts to build out the capabilities of Workday's full product portfolio.\nAs I think back to our early days, it's incredible to see the growth and scale we've been able to achieve. When our customers first went live in 2007, we offered a few different products. Today, we offer a full platform that helps our customers transform how they manage their people and their money. Additionally, we now have more than 5,400 core HCM and Finance customers, more than 65 million users under contract and process over 800 billion transactions per year. I'm proud of the company we've built and the continued value and impact that we deliver for our customers.\nIn closing, I want to extend my deepest thanks to our nearly 19,000 Workmates around the world for finishing our fiscal year 2024 in such a strong fashion. Workday's future is incredibly bright, and I'm energized to work alongside them, Carl and the rest of our leadership team to help drive Workday forward. With that, I'll hand it over to Zane. Over to you, Zane.\n\nZane Rowe\n\nnullChief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President\n\nThanks, Aneel, and thank you to everyone for joining today's call. As Carl and Aneel mentioned, Q4 marked a solid close to FY '24 with momentum building across our key investment initiatives. We enter FY '25 well positioned to deliver another year of durable subscription revenue growth, coupled with expanding margins.\nTurning to results. Subscription revenue in Q4 was $1.76 billion, up 18%, and full year FY '24 subscription revenue was $6.6 billion, growing 19%. Professional services revenue was $162 million in the quarter and $656 million for the year. Total revenue in Q4 was $1.92 billion and for the full year was $7.26 billion, both growing 17%. U.S. revenue in Q4 totaled $1.44 billion, up 16%, and international revenue totaled $478 million, growth of 21%. For the year, U.S. revenue was $5.46 billion and international revenue was $1.8 billion, both growing 17%.\nAs we have highlighted, we see significant long-term international market opportunities, which we expect over time will become a more meaningful driver of our growth. 12-month subscription revenue backlog or CRPO was $6.62 billion at the end of Q4, representing growth of 20% with the outperformance driven by higher-than-anticipated early renewals. Gross and net revenue retention rates remain over 95% and over 100%, respectively. Total subscription revenue backlog at the end of the quarter was $20.92 billion, up 27%.\nOur non-GAAP operating income for the fourth quarter was $461 million, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 23.9%. Full year non-GAAP operating income was $1.74 billion, reflecting a non-GAAP operating margin of 24%. Q4 GAAP net income benefited from a onetime $1.1 billion valuation allowance release related to our U.S. deferred tax assets. Q4 operating cash flow was $996 million, with approximately $100 million of the outperformance driven by strong in-quarter collections and earlier-than-expected payments. Full year operating cash flow was $2.15 billion, growth of 30%.\nDuring Q4, we repurchased $136 million of our shares at an average price of $253.85 per share. In addition, our Board of Directors has authorized a new $500 million share repurchase program. We ended the quarter with $7.8 billion in cash and marketable securities. We continue to invest in growth areas of the business, and we ended January with over 18,800 Workmates around the globe.\nNow turning to guidance. We are reiterating our full year FY '25 subscription revenue guidance of $7.725 billion to $7.775 billion, representing growth of 17% to 18%, which aligns with the preliminary outlook we provided last quarter. This guidance reflects our Q4 performance and our expectation for current macro conditions to persist throughout FY '25. We expect Q1 FY '25 subscription revenue to be $1.81 billion, representing 18% growth. I will highlight that Q1 benefits from an extra day of revenue recognition, given the leap year. Normalized for this, our guided subscription revenue growth in Q1 is approximately 17%. For Q2, we expect subscription revenue to increase approximately 5% sequentially, reflecting typical seasonality in the business when considering the leap year impact of Q1. We anticipate FY '25 professional services revenue of approximately $630 million to $640 million as we further leverage our partner ecosystem. For Q1, we expect professional services revenue of $163 million.\nTurning to backlog. As we've highlighted, CRPO growth is influenced by quarter-to-quarter variability in renewal volume, which can impact its growth in any particular quarter. In FY '25, we expect CRPO growth to come off the elevated levels we experienced in FY '24 as we lap periods of strong scheduled and early renewals. Given this variability, we expect CRPO to increase between 17.5% and 18.5% in Q1. We expect FY '25 non-GAAP operating margins of approximately 24.5%. Our outlook contemplates incremental investments across our key growth initiatives while delivering continued margin expansion as we scale and optimize the business. For Q1, we expect non-GAAP operating margin of 24.5%.\nGAAP operating margins for the first quarter and full year are expected to be approximately 24 and 21 percentage points lower than the non-GAAP margins, respectively. The FY '25 non-GAAP tax rate is 19%. We expect FY '25 operating cash flow of $2.25 billion, which is impacted by the $100 million of Q4 collections I called out as well as an extra payroll payment we expect to make in FY '25, given the leap year. In addition, we expect FY '25 capital expenditures of approximately $330 million.\nOur FY '25 outlook takes into account the acquisition of HiredScore, which is expected to close later this quarter. We're pleased with our execution in FY '24, thanks to the support of our customers, partners and Workmates. With momentum building across our strategic growth areas, we enter FY '25 focused on continuing to invest to drive long-term growth while also expanding margins. Let me turn it back over to Aneel before we begin Q&A.\n\nAneel Bhusri\n\nCo-Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Workday, Inc.\n\nThanks, Zane. Given my new role, this will be my last regularly scheduled earnings call as I fully hand over the reins to the great Carl and Zane. It's been a pleasure getting to know so many of you over the years, and I wanted to give a special thank you to Mark Murphy, Brent Thill, Pat Walravens, Kirk Materne and John DiFucci, who have all been covering Workday since our IPO in 2012, and also to Kash Rangan, who I'm sure wanted to cover us back then but couldn't because his wife was a Workmate at the time. Okay. With that, operator, let's go to the Q&A."

(Operator Instructions) With that, I will now hand it over to Justin Furby, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. Justin, you may begin.\n\nJustin Allen Furby\n\nSenior Director of IR, Workday, Inc.\n\n(technical difficulty)\nand Chano Fernandez, our co-CEOs; Barbara Larson, our CFO; Pete Schlampp, our Chief Strategy Officer; and Doug Robinson, our co-President.\nFollowing prepared remarks, we will take questions. Our press release was issued after close of market and is posted on our website where this call is being simultaneously webcast.\nBefore we get started, we want to emphasize that some of our statements on this call, particularly our guidance, are based on the information we have as of today and include forward-looking statements regarding our financial results, applications, customer demand, operations and other matters. These statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including those related to the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and recent macroeconomic events on our business and global economic conditions.\nPlease refer to the press release and the risk factors in documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our 2022 annual report on Form 10-K and our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q, for additional information on risks, uncertainties and assumptions that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in such statements.\nIn addition, during today's call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are useful as supplemental measures of Workday's performance. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to and not as a substitute for or in isolation from GAAP results. You can find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations with comparable GAAP results, in our earnings press release, in our investor presentation and on the Investor Relations page of our website.\nThe webcast replay of this call will be available for the next 90 days on our company website under the Investor Relations link. Additionally, our quarterly investor presentation will be posted on our Investor Relations website following this call. Also, the customers' page of our website includes a list of selected customers and is updated monthly.\nOur fourth quarter fiscal 2023 quiet period begins on January 15, 2023. Unless otherwise stated, all financial comparisons in this call will be to our results for the comparable period of our fiscal 2022.\nWith that, I'll hand the call over to Aneel.\n\nAneel Bhusri\n\nCo-Founder, Co-CEO & Chairman of the Board, Workday, Inc.\n\nThank you, Justin, and welcome to Workday's Third Quarter Fiscal '23 Earnings Conference Call. I'm happy to report that we had a solid Q3 as we once again outperformed across our key operating metrics. There is no question that the macro environment presents increased uncertainty, but as we've said before, we are well positioned in this type of environment because our cloud finance and HR solutions are truly mission-critical. As our Q3 results showed, more and more organizations are selecting Workday as their trusted partner to help them successfully navigate today's changing world.\nWe remain confident in our ability to capitalize on the opportunity ahead and are pleased to announce our first-ever share repurchase program of up to $500 million under authorization. This program will help reduce the rate of our share dilution going forward and is driven by our belief that our share price is undervalued given the long-term growth opportunity ahead. Barbara will share details shortly, but know that we feel confident that we'll reach a scale where we can roll out this repurchase program while continuing to prioritize investing for long-term profitable growth.\nWith that, I'd like to share some highlights from the quarter. In Q3, we further solidified our position as a leader in cloud HR with notable new HCM customers, including Intermountain Health, SGS and Texas Roadhouse. In addition, we had several key HCM go-lives, including Best Buy, Canadian Tire Corporation and the state of Oklahoma. For Workday Financial Management, we continue to see strong demand and momentum in Q3. Key new wins included a Fortune 200 provider of information technology solutions, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, EZCORP and Thomas Jefferson University. It's important to note that each of these customers have also selected us for HCM, reinforcing the power of the full Workday platform and providing further evidence that companies are going all in with us. Key financial management go-lives during the quarter included City of Baltimore and Medical University of South Carolina.\nQ3 also saw us get back in person for Workday Rising, our annual customer conference for the first time since 2019. We had nearly 16,000 in-person and virtual attendees, and it was great to experience the energy and see firsthand how our community is growing and evolving. This was highlighted by the fact that this year's event has a large percentage of senior leaders, finance and IT attendees ever.\nOne big takeaway from Rising is that our innovation story is resonating with customers as we evolve to be more open and connected. While we've traditionally targeted the offices of CHRO and CFO, we have placed increased focus recently on the office of the CIO, which presents another growth opportunity for us.\nOne solution in particular that was a popular topic among IT attendees was Workday Extend. Workday Extend lets customers and partners build their own unique solutions on top of Workday, which is a huge point of emphasis for CIOs and, in their eyes, positions us even more as a true platform player. While we announced several availability at Workday Extend in 2020, we've continued to see accelerated demand for it over the last year as the need for organizations to quickly innovate and adapt in today's business environment increases.\nWe also announced new more personalized UX enhancements that meet every type of Workday user in the natural flow of their work such as mobile devices, Microsoft Teams and Slack, which helps us to address another CIO priority as they are more focused than ever on driving increased employee engagement.\nAnd finally, we further reinforced our leadership in artificial intelligence and machine learning with the announcement of next-generation skills technology that allows customers to more easily and securely bring skills data in and out of Workday. This helps customers leverage the full power of machine learning to gain deeper insights into their workforce skills and deliver more personalized employee experiences.\nIn closing, we once again delivered a solid quarter with strength across a number of key growth initiatives, showcasing why Workday is the backbone of digital business. And while we expect that the macro uncertainty will cause our growth to moderate in the near term, we continue to believe we are well positioned to navigate this environment and emerge even stronger. Driving constant innovation to address our customers' evolving needs has always been key to our success and will continue to be our focus in this environment.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to our co-CEO, Chano Fernandez. Chano, over to you.\n\nLuciano Fernandez Gomez\n\nCo-CEO & Director, Workday, Inc.\n\nThank you, Aneel, and thank you to everyone for joining today's call. I want to start off by offering my sincere thanks to the more than 17,500 Workmates that help us deliver another solid quarter. Your relentless focus on the customer continues to push us and the broader Workday community forward. Great job, team.\nI've been on the road a lot the last few months, including Workday Rising in Europe which has wrapped up in Stockholm and Workday Rising in U.S. back in September. I've had the opportunity to spend time with hundreds of customers and prospects, and there are a couple of key themes emerging.\nFirst, despite all the challenges that companies are facing today, they increasingly realize the present need to modernize their HR and financial systems. The executives that I speak with have different viewpoints on what the macroeconomic climate will look like in the year ahead. But one thing they agree on is that the change is constant and it's nearly impossible to navigate with legacy systems.\nSecond, there is a clear desire to consolidate and prioritize spend across a new organization's more strategic technology vendors. Given our positioning as the backbone of digital business across HR and finance, this trend has led to more and more companies going all in with Workday as they look to harness the power of their data across the enterprise. And when I look at our solid Q3 results across both the large and medium enterprise, it's a direct validation of these themes being seen across organizations of all sizes.\nFrom a geographic standpoint, we saw solid results across North America with a number of CoreHR and FINS wins that Aneel mentioned, in addition to several strategic expansions across the Fortune 500. APA also outperformed with wins at Bank of Queensland, Fletcher Building, [Ono] Pharmaceutical and Trip.com, to name a few. And in EMEA, we had a number of important wins and expansions, including SGS, [Allianz] Medical Group and Equiniti.\nOur customer base sales team once again saw outstanding growth, a direct reflection of the trust that customers are placing in us and a validation of our strategy. We drove very strong renewal rates in Q3, and we closed a number of strategic expansions at companies such as Accenture, University of Maryland, the state of Nebraska, Pick n Pay, Puma and VF Corporation.\nAs we shared at our recent Analyst Day, our customer base momentum is being driven by our broad portfolio. Solutions such as Journeys, Help and Talent Optimization, for example, are seeing strong adoption as customers look to support employee experience, while our scheduling, time tracking and payroll solutions are all resonating as customers increasingly focused on labor optimization. And other products such as Planning, Extend, Accounting Center, VNDLY and our Spend Management solutions are all contributing to this quarter's strength across the customer base.\nOur industry focus continues to pay off. In Q3, nowhere was this more evident than the health care vertical where we had a strong growth in new ACV and where we surpassed $0.5 billion in annual recurring revenue. By far, the 2 largest costs for health care organizations are labor and materials. And by leveraging our full suite of HCM, FINS and supply chain solutions, they are able to help optimize spend across these critical areas. In fact, all of our larger Q3 health care wins were full suite and including Workday's supply chain management.\nWe also saw healthy momentum within the professional services industry highlighted by the aforementioned expansion at Accenture as we continue to co-innovate across the Workday platform, including significant new developments in the skills cloud, public cloud and accessibility.\nOther strategic wins in the professional services industry included Novozymes and Reed Global, which was a full suite win. Our expanding partner ecosystem is also becoming an increasingly important driver of our growth. Key to our strategy is driving core innovation across the platform, which increases the differentiation of our solutions, enables even faster innovation to address real-time customer challenges and allows our partners to leverage their deep industry and solution insights to differentiate in the market.\nExamples of recent partner-driven innovation built on the Workday platform include Accenture's digital revenue operations solution, which integrates CPQ capabilities with Workday's billing and revenue automation to enable seamless quote-to-cash functionality for software and technology companies.\nAnother great example is employee document management, built by partner Kainos on Workday Extend, which provides our customers with advanced document generation, access control storage and finely tuned document retention rules. These are just a few several solutions that were recently released by our partner ecosystem, and we have dozens more on the road map.\nAs we move into our fourth quarter, the environment remains uncertain, which has led to increased scrutiny and the lengthening of certain sales cycles, particularly with the net new opportunities. While we aren't immune to this and see signs that it will persist into next year, we are confident in our diverse pipeline and are focused on executing in Q4 and laying a strong foundation for FY '24 and beyond.\nWith that, I will turn it over to our CFO, Barbara Larson. Over to you, Barbara.\n\nBarbara Larson\n\nCFO, Workday, Inc.\n\nThanks, Chano, and good afternoon, everyone. As Aneel and Chano mentioned, we delivered solid Q3 results in the face of continued economic uncertainty, a testament to strong execution across the company as well as the strategic and mission-critical nature of our solutions.\nSubscription revenue in Q3 was $1.43 billion, up 22% year-over-year, and professional services revenue was $167 million, up 7%. Total revenue outside of the U.S. was $394 million, representing 25% of total revenue. 24-month backlog at the end of the third quarter was $8.62 billion, growth of 21%. The result was driven by solid new business sales and strong renewals, with gross and net revenue retention rates over 95% and over 100%, respectively. Total subscription revenue backlog at the end of Q3 was $14.10 billion, up 28%.\nOur non-GAAP operating income for the third quarter was $314 million, resulting in non-GAAP operating margin of 19.7%. Margin overachievement was driven by revenue outperformance, favorable cost variances across the business and the timing of certain expenses shifting into Q4.\nQ3 operating cash flow was $409 million, growth of 6%. Our cash flow this quarter was impacted by a $55 million semiannual interest payment associated with our Q1 debt offering. We also paid off the principal balance on our $1.15 billion convertible debt with cash in October, resulting in a reduction to our non-GAAP diluted share count of roughly 8 million shares. Given the late Q3 timing, this share count reduction will be fully reflected in our non-GAAP weighted average share count in Q4.\nDuring the quarter, we successfully added approximately 600 net new employees, ending Q3 with a global workforce of more than 17,500. We expect a strong moderation of hiring as we move into Q4, but we'll continue to add key talent across strategic growth areas of the business, notably go-to-market and product and technology. Overall, we're extremely proud of the strong company-wide performance in Q3, and we're focused on executing in Q4, our seasonally strongest quarter of the year.\nNow turning to guidance, which reflects both the continued momentum in our business while also balancing an uncertain macro environment. With that context, our guidance for FY '23 subscription revenue is now $5.555 billion to $5.557 billion, representing 22% year-over-year growth. We expect Q4 subscription revenue to be $1.483 billion to $1.485 billion, 21% year-over-year growth. We now expect professional services revenue to be $645 million in FY '23 with the slight reduction driven by the delay of a large project. For Q4, we expect professional services revenue of $147 million.\nWe expect 24-month backlog to grow approximately 19% year-over-year in Q4. We expect Q4 non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 17.5%, which includes some expenses that shifted out of Q3. Our FY '23 non-GAAP operating margin guidance is now 19.2%.\nGAAP operating margins for both the fourth quarter and the full year are expected to be approximately 23 percentage points lower than the non-GAAP margins. This includes a change to our employee stock plan that will take effect in Q4 to provide more flexibility to our employees during the open trading window each quarter. Our vesting date will move from the 15th to the 5th of each month for all outstanding grants, resulting in an acceleration of stock-based compensation expense of approximately $30 million in Q4. This change will result in reduced stock-based compensation expense by the same amount over the next few years and has no impact on our dilution.\nThe FY '23 non-GAAP tax rate remains at 19%. We are maintaining our FY '23 guidance for operating cash flow of $1.64 billion, but are reducing our capital expenditures outlook to approximately $375 million, reflecting the timing of certain data center and real estate investments being pushed out to future periods. And as Aneel mentioned, we are pleased to announce a share repurchase program with authority to repurchase up to $500 million in shares over an 18-month period.\nWe will continue to prioritize allocating capital towards organic innovation, followed by targeted M&A, but given our strong balance sheet and free cash flow, we intend to use a portion of our capital towards the repurchase of shares, enabling us to partially offset future dilution from employee stock programs. This repurchase program is a direct reflection of our confidence in the business and our view that our shares are currently undervalued.\nWhile we are early in our planning cycle for next year and have an important Q4 ahead, we'd like to provide a preliminary view of FY '24. As discussed at our Financial Analyst Day, we have a significant long-term opportunity and multiple growth levers that drive our goal of sustaining 20% plus subscription revenue growth on our path to $10 billion in revenue. While this remains our multiyear goal, given the continued macro uncertainty, we believe it's prudent to provide a preliminary FY '24 subscription revenue range of approximately $6.5 billion to $6.6 billion or 17% to 19% year-over-year growth. This outlook takes into account the lengthening of sales cycles that we're currently seeing impact our net new business.\nFrom a margin standpoint, we currently expect FY '24 non-GAAP operating margin expansion of 150 to 200 basis points from FY '23 levels, placing us firmly on track to our target of 25% non-GAAP operating margin and 35% operating cash flow margin at $10 billion in revenue. The expected margin expansion is driven by the scalability of our model, a strong moderation of hiring and ongoing expense discipline. We plan to operate the business with agility, and we'll continue to appropriately balance growth investments based on what we see in the underlying market environment. And finally, I'll close by thanking our amazing employees, customers and partners for their continued support and hard work.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to the operator to begin Q&A."

(Operator Instructions)\nWith that, I'll hand the call over to Justin Furby, Vice President, Investor Relations.\n\nJustin Allen Furby\n\nSenior Director of IR, Workday, Inc.\n\nThank you, operator. Welcome to Workday's First Quarter Fiscal 2023 Earnings Conference Call. On the call, we have Aneel Bhusri and Chano Fernandez, our co-CEOs; Barbara Larson, our CFO; and Pete Schlampp, our Chief Strategy Officer. Following prepared remarks, we will take questions. Our press release was issued after close of market and is posted on our website, where this call is being simultaneously webcast.\nBefore we get started, we want to emphasize that some of our statements on this call, particularly our guidance, are based on the information we have as of today and include forward-looking statements regarding our financial results, application, customer demand, operation and other matters. These statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including those related to the impacts of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and recent macroeconomic events on our business and global economic conditions.\nPlease refer to the press release and the risk factors in documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our 2022 annual report on Form 10-K and our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q, for additional information on risks, uncertainties and assumptions that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in such statements.\nIn addition, during today's call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are useful as supplemental measures of Workday's performance. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to and not as a substitute for or in isolation from GAAP results. You can find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations with comparable GAAP results, in our earnings press release, in our investor presentation and on the Investor Relations page of our website.\nThe webcast replay of this call will be available for the next 90 days on our company website under the Investor Relations link. Starting with this quarter and going forward, we will be posting a quarterly investor presentation on our Investor Relations website following each quarter's call. Also, the Customers page of our website includes a list of selected customers and is updated monthly.\nOur second quarter fiscal 2023 quiet period begins on July 16, 2022. Unless otherwise stated, all financial comparisons in this call will be to our results for the comparable period of our fiscal 2022.\nWith that, I'll hand the call over to Aneel.\n\nAneel Bhusri\n\nCo-Founder, Co-CEO & Chairman of the Board, Workday, Inc.\n\nThank you, Justin, and welcome to Workday's First Quarter Fiscal Year '23 Earnings Conference Call. Before we begin, we are heartbroken by the recent acts of violence and the senseless loss of life. There are no words to explain the pain the parents, children, families and loved ones of the victims must be feeling. Our thoughts are with them and the people of Uvalde, Texas; Buffalo, New York; Laguna Woods, California and every other community that has endured such tragedy. Everyone has the right to feel safe in the places where they learn, live, work, worship and do simple day errands.\nTurning now to our business and coming off an exceptional fiscal year '22 of acceleration in the business. Workday reported solid Q1 results, delivering subscription revenue growth of 23%. During the quarter, we continue to see companies across our target geographies and industries select Workday as they move their finance and HR systems to the cloud. At the same time, several key opportunities that we had expected to close in Q1 were pushed to later in the year, impacting backlog performance. Barbara will touch on later in the call.\nWe continue to see strong demand for our products and are optimistic about the year. We are mindful, however, of the current macroeconomic and geopolitical environments and the impact these conditions could have on businesses globally. With that in mind, our focus remains on what we can control, which is to continue to drive innovation as we broaden our offering to become an even more strategic partner to our customers, deliver the industry's top levels of customer support, cultivate our culture, which remains foundational to all that we do.\nNow I'd like to share some of the business highlights from Q1, starting with Workday HCM. Barclays, Callaway Golf and West Tennessee Healthcare were just a few of the many new customers that we welcomed last quarter. While these new wins are very important to us, we remain equally focused on ensuring our customers successfully go live, critical to our ability to drive customer satisfaction. Notable go-lives in Q1 include Hy-Vee; Kyndryl; and Royal Bank of Canada, better known as RBC.\nProven ability to support our customers' large volumes of data and transactions continues to be a significant differentiator in our success. It's not just our scalability that differentiates us. It's also our unique ability to innovate and deliver valuable insights to our customers across the office of the [CHRO]. In learning, for example, we recently crossed the 2,000 customer milestone. We now have over 3,100 recruiting customers. We're also opening new markets with solutions with Analytics, which now has over 500 customers; Workday Journeys, which has over 300 customers. We're a clear market leader in HCM, something that we don't take for granted. We continue to find new ways to increase our strategic positioning within the office of the CHRO.\nTurning to our offerings for the office of the CFO. We once again saw continued strength across the board. Highlights included key full suite wins at American University, Lehigh Valley Hospital and Mohegan Tribal Gaming Authority along with several core financial customer go-lives in the quarter, including Advocate Aurora Health and Sentara Healthcare, to name a few.\nOur strategy for many years now and one of our key differentiators is providing organizations with a unified solution to plan, execute and analyze their businesses in real time. That strategy is clearly resonating in the market with Workday Adaptive Planning now being used by nearly 6,000 organizations globally, including nearly 75% of our core FINS customers. Prism Analytics nearing 1,000 customers, being roughly 40% of our core financials customers.\nAs you know, Workday was founded on a core set of values that help guide our decisions as we look to do what's right for our employees, the customers we serve and the world around us. The example of this approach can be seen through our increased focus on supporting our customers' evolving ESG initiatives. We have quickly become a top priority in the boardroom and for the office of the CFO, especially considering the most recent and upcoming SEC disclosure requirements.\nIn Q1, we announced 2 new solutions that will be available this year to further help companies view their businesses through an ESG lens. First is social reporting for ESG to help our customers more easily track progress against goals and identify areas for improvement within workforce composition, organizational health, diversity and workforce investments.\nThe second is supplier and sustainability. We help customers to improve the sustainability and resilience of their supply chains, test Scope 3 emissions across their suppliers. Adding these 2 new solutions to our existing product portfolio further strengthens our ability to be a strategic partner of customers, shareholders on their ESG.\nSwitching to the people front. We continue to invest heavily in our company culture to sustain our belief that happy employees deliver the highest levels of satisfaction to our great customers. On that note, in early April, we announced exciting expansion plans for our European headquarters in Dublin, Ireland. We intend to create 1,000 new jobs over the next 2 years, which will increase our overall Ireland-based workforce by approximately 60% in addition to breaking ground on a new European headquarters building. Dublin site plays a critical role in our product development and customer service efforts. We decided to build on the already incredible group of employees we have in Dublin.\nAs we look forward, amid the backdrop of macro uncertainty, we're comforted by the fact that, as a company, we've been through these cycles before, most recently navigating the pandemic, and as a younger company, the 2008-2009 financial crisis. Each time, we have come out stronger and remain confident in the fundamentals of our business and our long-term strategy. We believe that our leadership position will only strengthen. We have a proven track record of growth at scale, a robust business model with strong cash flow generation, a value-driven culture that attracts the best talent and constantly (inaudible) always been a recipe for long-term success for us.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to our Co-CEO, Chano Fernandez. Over to you, Chano.\n\nLuciano Fernandez Gomez\n\nCo-CEO & Director, Workday, Inc.\n\nThank you, Aneel, and thank you to everyone for joining today. I want to begin by extending a special welcome to the more than 700 many Workmates that joined the company during Q1. I recently had the opportunity to travel across several of our global offices and meet with many of our new and long-time Workmates. And I must say the energy within the company is amazing. I look forward to seeing what we can achieve together in FY '23 and beyond.\nWe delivered a solid first quarter as momentum across both our net new and customer-based teams continued, and we once again drove very strong renewals, a testament to the strategic nature of our solutions and our commitment to customer satisfaction. As Aneel mentioned, we did see the timing of several Q1 key deals push into future quarters, and we've also seen some Q2 pipeline opportunities move to the second half, but we are confident in closing them later this year. More broadly, we see healthy overall pipeline, positioning us to deliver a strong FY '23 as we remain focused on driving sustainable 20%-plus subscription revenue growth.\nFrom a geographic standpoint, in Q1, we had solid growth across several international markets, highlighted by the U.K. where we have significant wins at companies such as Barclays and NatWest Banking Group; in France, where people drove strategic lands at Accor and Orange S.A.; and in the Nordics and Netherlands, where we increased our footprint with companies such as Booking.com and Scandic Hotels.\nIn the U.S., we saw strength across multiple areas, including the medium enterprise, where our broad portfolio of solutions across the CHRO and CFO is driving our success. In the large enterprise, in addition to some of the new core HR and financial management wins, we expanded our strategic footprint with several of our existing customers, such as Voya, Advanced Auto Parts and one of the world's largest technology companies. Our customer base motion continues to drive strong momentum, and we're very excited by the growth we see ahead.\nIndustry is another area of significant opportunity, including emerging industries like the U.S. federal government as well as established ones such as health care, where we're the market-leading provider for both cloud-based HCM and financial solutions. Some of our most strategic transactions having go-lives in Q1 came out of our health care team, including wins at Lehigh Valley Hospital, Health Research Inc. and West Tennessee Healthcare as well as FINS go-lives at Advocate Aurora Health and Sentara Healthcare. And there is clear momentum looking forward as our significant base of reference customers, along with our targeted product investments in areas like supply chain, are clearly paying off.\nAnother key growth opportunity is across our partner ecosystem, which from day 1 has been critical to our customers' success. Not only do our partners help ensure successful deployments. But through the extensibility of our platform, they're also accelerating our product road map. A great example is Huron Consulting who leveraged the industry expertise and operational supply chain knowledge to develop a demand planning solution on Workday Adaptive Planning, purpose-built for the health care industry. Using this solution, Dayton Children's Hospital is able to make data-driven decisions and ensure physical supplies, resources and space are available when patients need them most. This is just one of several areas of innovation we've seen from our ecosystem.\nOver the course of Q1, we deepened our partnerships with multiple systems integrators, like Accenture, Deloitte and PwC, to not only launch new partner-built solutions but to align our core innovation plans to scale and accelerate over the coming quarters. Helping us drive this effort and our overall ecosystem strategy is our new Chief Partner Officer, Sam Alkharrat, who brings more than 2 decades of experience to the role and who will report directly to me. Welcome, Sam.\nIn closing, we enter Q2 with healthy pipelines and a positioning across the offices of the CHRO and CFO that is as strategic as ever. We remain squarely focused on executing against our growth opportunities and in laying the foundation to support the durable 20%-plus subscription revenue growth on our path to $10 billion in revenue.\nWith that, I will turn it over to our CFO, Barbara Larson. Over to you, Barbara.\n\nBarbara Larson\n\nCFO, Workday, Inc.\n\nThanks, Chano, and good afternoon, everyone. As Aneel and Chano mentioned, we had a solid start to the year as organizations across the globe continue to choose Workday as their strategic partner in driving their finance and HR digital transformations. Subscription revenue in Q1 was $1.27 billion, up 23% year-over-year. And professional services revenue was $163 million, up 14%. Total revenue outside of the U.S. was $360 million, representing 25% of total revenue. 24-month backlog at the end of the first quarter was $7.97 billion, growth of 21%. Growth was driven by solid new ACV and strong renewals with growth in net revenue retention rates over 95% and over 100%, respectively.\nAs Aneel and Chano mentioned, we saw the timing of several deals, including a few large ones, pushed from Q1 into future quarters in FY '23, which impacted our 24-month and total subscription revenue backlog growth by approximately 1 percentage point. Total subscription revenue backlog was $12.65 billion, up 26%. Our non-GAAP operating income for the first quarter was $289 million, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 20.1%. Margin overachievement was driven by a combination of top line overperformance and the timing of certain expenses. As expected, we made significant investments across the business in Q1 and began to transition back to the office as well as resuming travel and in-person events.\nWe had a strong start to the year for cash flow with Q1 operating cash flow of $440 million. During the quarter, we raised $3 billion in cash through a public debt offering at attractive fixed interest rates, enabling us to repay existing debt while also providing additional flexibility as we plan for the future. We prepaid our $694 million floating rate term loan in April and intend to pay the principal balance of our $1.15 billion convertible debt in cash when it comes due in October. When this occurs, our non-GAAP diluted share count will decrease by roughly 8 million shares. Due to the late Q3 timing, this share reduction will not be fully reflected in our non-GAAP weighted average share count until Q4.\nOur largest investments continue to be in our people and attracting top talent to Workday. During the quarter, we successfully added and integrated over 700 net new employees, ending Q1 with more than 15,900 employees. The strong hiring is a testament to our culture, our global brand and the significant growth opportunity that we have ahead. Overall, we are pleased with the solid company-wide execution in Q1 and remain focused on leveraging our leadership position to drive sustainable 20%-plus subscription revenue growth on our path to $10 billion in revenue.\nTurning now to guidance, which reflects continued momentum across our business while also taking into account a more back-end weighted year than we originally anticipated. We are raising our guidance for FY '23 subscription revenue to be in the range of $5.537 billion to $5.557 billion, representing 22% year-over-year growth. We expect our Q2 subscription revenue to be $1.353 billion to $1.355 billion, 22% year-over-year growth, with sequential growth in Q3 of approximately 4.5%.\nWe still expect professional services revenue to be $650 million in FY '23 as we continue our tight alignment with our growing partner ecosystem to help ensure our customers have successful implementations that support the highest levels of customer satisfaction and business value. For Q2, we expect professional services revenue of $164 million. We expect the 24-month backlog to grow approximately 20% year-over-year in Q2 of FY '23. We continue to expect FY '23 non-GAAP operating margins of 18.5%. For Q2, we expect non-GAAP operating margins of 17.5%, which reflects typical seasonality as a result of our annual employee compensation cycle, which took effect at the beginning of Q2.\nInvesting for long-term growth remains our priority, and we'll continuously evaluate growth/margin trade-offs, but we have confidence in the strength of our business model and in achieving 25% non-GAAP operating margins at $10 billion in revenue. The GAAP margins for the second quarter and the full year are expected to be approximately 22 and 24 percentage points lower, respectively, than the non-GAAP margins. The FY '23 non-GAAP tax rate remains at 19%.\nAs a result of our recent debt IPO, we are lowering our FY '23 guidance for operating cash flows to $1.61 billion, which takes into account approximately $55 million of cash interest payments associated with the debt. We continue to expect capital expenditures of $475 million this year to support our customer growth and continued business expansion.\nAnd finally, I'll close by thanking our amazing employees, customers and partners for their continued support and hard work.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to the operator to begin Q&A."

Before we get started, we want to emphasize that some of our statements on this call, particularly our guidance, are based on the information we have as of today and include forward-looking statements regarding our financial results applications, customer demand, operations and other matters. These statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including those related to the impacts of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and recent macroeconomic events on our business and global economic conditions. Please refer to the press release and the Risk Factors and documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K and our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q for additional information on risks, uncertainties and assumptions that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in such statements.\nIn addition, during today's call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are useful as supplemental measures of Workday's performance.

Additionally, our quarterly investor presentation will be posted on our Investor Relations website following this call. Also, the customers' page of our website includes a list of selected customers and is updated monthly. Our third quarter fiscal 2023 quiet period begins on October 15, 2022. Unless otherwise stated, all financial comparisons in this call will be to our results for the comparable period of our fiscal 2022.\nWith that, I'll hand the call over to Aneel.\n\nAneel Bhusri\n\nCo-Founder, Co-CEO & Chairman of the Board, Workday, Inc.\n\nThank you, Justin, and welcome to Workday's Second Quarter Fiscal '23 Earnings Conference Call. I'm pleased to report that Workday delivered a strong second quarter, thanks to healthy demand across all product areas and geographies. Additionally, we closed on 2 of the larger deals that had pushed from Q1, which we referenced on last quarter's call. Our results, which outperformed across our key operating metrics underscore the continued importance of digital transformation for finance and HR. And even with the uncertainty in this environment, we remain confident in our long-term growth prospects because Workday continues to serve as a mission-critical partner to our customers with a proven track record of success.\nBefore I turn it over to Chano, who will share more on our go-to-market success and Barbara who will provide specifics on our Q2 financial results and outlook, I'd like to share some second quarter highlights. We had another strong quarter for Workday HCM, where the migration to the cloud continues with notable customer additions, including Electrolux, First Student, Groupe Adeo, Korean Air and Raymond James. And as always, customer success remains a key differentiator for Workday. In Q2, we had several HCM go-lives, including Cox Enterprises, Southwest Airlines and United Overseas Bank.\nTurning to Workday Financial Management. We saw very strong growth in the second quarter as we added 2 Fortune 500 core financial management customers, and I'm very excited to share that one of those was Salesforce, the global leader in CRM. Already a longtime Workday HCM customer and partner, Salesforce's expanded use of Workday now includes Workday Financial Management along with accounting center, Workday Adaptive Planning, Prism Analytics and more. Our growing partnership reinforces the opportunity we have to help support customers in the cloud. With this broad relationship, Salesforce becomes one of an increasing number of high-profile customers to expand from Workday HCM to both HCM and financial management.\nOther new financial management customers in Q2 included American Electric Power, which was the second of our Q2 Fortune 500 wins; Apex Fund Company; Dave & Busters, Express LLC; and the state of Vermont, while key go-lives in Q2 included Comerica Bank, RSM and the University of Virginia.\nIn addition to the strong growth from our core suite of HCM and finance applications, Q2 also saw notable momentum across our broader portfolio of solutions. Workday Adaptive Planning recently celebrated its 4-year anniversary as part of Workday, and I'm happy to share that we now serve more than 6,000 planning customers, including over 20% of the Fortune 500. It was also our second full quarter with VNDLY as part of Workday, and we're already seeing solid results as it's opening up new opportunities for us to expand our relationship with customers who want to embrace a more holistic workforce strategy.\nWe also continue to see strong adoption of Workday Extend and Prism Analytics as both solutions are providing organizations, including the office of the CIO, with the ability to adapt in today's changing world. With Extend, customers build apps that are tailored for their unique use cases, which can eliminate the need for other custom development tools. Over the last year, we have more than doubled the number of customers and now have more than 750 applications that have been developed on the Workday platform. And Prism Analytics, with now more than 1,000 customers, is enabling organizations to bring operational data into Workday to drive real-time business insights. These solutions are not only critical to our customer community, but are enabling a new level of engagement with our partner community as well.\nAnd speaking of our customer community, customer service has always been one of our core values. As a result, we strive to maintain a customer satisfaction rating of over 95%, and I'm pleased to announce that in 2022, we surpassed this rating again as we have for more than a decade. This achievement is a direct testament to the amazing work of our employees and their commitment to helping our customers thrive.\nWe look forward to sharing more about our product innovation, customer success and market opportunity in September at Workday Rising, our Annual Customer Conference. This will mark the first time since 2019 that we're able to hold Workday Rising in-person, and we are so excited to get more than 9,000 members of the Workday community together in Orlando with thousands attending virtually for what is always a special event.\nIn closing, we had a strong second quarter and the first half of the year. While we recognize that the current environment will likely moderate the pace of growth in the second half of the year, we firmly believe that the strong gets stronger during periods of economic uncertainty. And we will continue to manage the business with that mindset and expectation, all in support of driving enduring growth for many years to come.\nWith that, over to you, Chano.\n\nLuciano Fernandez Gomez\n\nCo-CEO & Director, Workday, Inc.\n\nThank you, Aneel, and thank you to everyone for joining today's call. I want to begin by expressing my sincere thanks to the entire global organization for an incredible Q2. Every one of our nearly 17,000 workmates really leaned in and drove this result, and I couldn't be prouder of our execution. Great job, team. Our strong Q2 results were driven by momentum across several of our key growth initiatives, including customer base, international, medium enterprise and the office of the CFO, a testament to our strategy and the significant long-term opportunity that we have ahead.\nIn addition, as Aneel mentioned, we closed the 2 largest deals that slipped out of Q1. And while the near-term market environment remains uncertain and we are not immune to it, we continue to see organizations of all sizes prioritizing their investments with Workday to continue their digital backbone transformation and drive increased agility and flexibility.\nFrom a geographic standpoint, we executed incredibly well across our global markets. In the U.S., we saw healthy growth in the large enterprise, including 5 Fortune 500 core HCM or FINS wins, and in the medium enterprise, our suite approach continues to resonate, driving another quarter of very strong results. International performance was again a highlight as our investment in key regions and the ongoing journey to the cloud are resulting in significant growth. In EMEA, we had outperformance across a number of key countries, including France, Germany and the United Kingdom. And finally, in APJ, we had very solid performance in strategic markets like Japan and Australia.\nAs you know, we go to market with land-and-expand sales motions, and both things drove healthy growth in Q2. Aneel already mentioned several of our core HCM and FINS wins, many of which were new customers to Workday. We also closed several strategic deals across our emerging land motions, including planning-first wins at ExxonMobil and Ninja Van and a Peakon-first led win at a 300,000-plus employee global organization headquartered in Europe.\nIn addition to strengthening our land motion, our customer base sales teams in Q2 once again drove very strong results, including solid renewals and meaningful acceleration in new ACV with broad-based strength across a number of solutions, including core FINS, Extend, Peakon, learning, payroll and talent optimization. We're also seeing momentum built within our planning-first customers who are expanding their footprint by adding core HCM and financials. Carle Health is a great example of this. They started as a planning-first relationship and expanded their footprint to include core FINS in Q2. Industry is another area of significant opportunity and investment, and I am pleased to share that financial services is our first industry to exceed $1 billion in annual recurring revenue. Some of our most strategic transactions and go-lives in Q2 came out of our financial services team, including new lands that Aneel referenced at Raymond James and Apex Fund, expansion deals at Bank of Montreal and Cushman & Wakefield and go-lives at United Overseas Bank and Comerica.\nOther established industries, including health care and education and government also saw continued momentum and we are gaining steam in verticals such as retail/hospitality and technology/media, where wins included Salesforce, Avalara and GoPuff. Needless to say, we have several other industries that are on the path to $1 billion and beyond.\nOur expanding partner ecosystem is becoming an increasingly important driver of our growth and industry success, and the excitement we're seeing within our partner community for the joint opportunity in front of us was on full display recently at Altitude, our annual partner event. Strategic system integrators such as Accenture, Deloitte, KPMG and PwC are not only ensuring successful deployment, but also serving as an innovation engine addressing our customers' needs. Together, we're also targeting industry accelerators with specific solutions and use cases. We look forward to sharing a lot more on this at Workday Rising in a few weeks.\nAs we move through the second half of the year, we expect the environment to remain uncertain. And we see signs that in certain deal cycles, particularly some of our more strategic opportunities, there is increased scrutiny and potentially longer sales cycles, as buyers do extra work before making investment decisions during these uncertain times. The good news is that when companies go through their due diligence, we typically come out on top, given the compelling return on investment and reduced total cost of ownership that our solutions provide, our track record of successful deployments of scale and our reference base of thousands of customers who can speak to the meaningful business value that Workday delivers.\nWith that, I will turn it over to our CFO, Barbara Larson. Over to you, Barbara.\n\nBarbara Larson\n\nCFO, Workday, Inc.\n\nThanks, Chano, and good afternoon, everyone. As Aneel and Chano mentioned, we delivered a strong Q2 as enterprises of all sizes increasingly realize the need for a flexible, modern finance and HR solutions to navigate their businesses and drive change during these uncertain times. Subscription revenue in Q2 was $1.37 billion, up 23% year-over-year, and Professional Services revenue was $168 million, up 15%. Total revenue outside of the U.S. was $383 million, representing 25% of total revenue. 24-month backlog at the end of the second quarter was $8.37 billion, growth of 22%. The outperformance was driven by strong new ACV across both our land and expand sales motions along with solid renewals with growth and net revenue retention rates over 95% and over 100%, respectively. Total subscription revenue backlog at the end of Q2 was $13.47 billion, up 27%.\nOur non-GAAP operating income for the second quarter was $302 million, resulting in non-GAAP operating margin of 19.6%. Margin overachievement was driven by a combination of topline overperformance, the timing of certain projects and some favorable expense variances. Q2 operating cash flow was $114 million, which reflects typical seasonality from our annual merit cycle increase. In addition, with the final 2 days of the quarter falling over a weekend, we saw roughly $40 million of collections shipped out of Q2 into early Q3, which will have a positive impact on our third quarter cash flow.\nOur largest investments continue to be in our people and attracting top talent to Workday. During the quarter, we successfully added approximately 1,000 net new employees, ending Q2 with a global workforce of more than 16,900. Our hiring was focused on adding key talent across strategic growth areas of the business, notably go-to-market resources and product innovation roles. Overall, we're extremely proud of the strong company-wide execution in Q2 and remain focused on leveraging our leadership position to drive sustainable 20% plus subscription revenue growth on our path to $10 billion in revenue.\nTurning now to guidance, which reflects the momentum in our business and the mission-critical nature of our solutions, while also balancing an uncertain macro environment, which Aneel and Chano described. With that context, we are maintaining our guidance for FY '23 subscription revenue of $5.537 billion to $5.557 billion, representing 22% year-over-year growth. We expect Q3 subscription revenue to be $1.418 billion to $1.420 billion, 21% year-over-year growth. We still expect professional services revenue to be $650 million in FY '23, as we continue to tightly align with our growing partner ecosystem to help ensure our customers have successful implementations that support the highest levels of customer satisfaction and business value.\nFor Q3, we expect professional services revenue of $164 million. We expect 24-month backlog to grow approximately 19% year-over-year in Q3. We now expect FY '23 non-GAAP operating margin of 19%, reflecting a more measured pace of hiring in the second half of the year as we continue to monitor the macroeconomic environment. Investing for long-term growth alongside ongoing expense discipline remains our priority. We continue to have confidence in the strength of our business model and in achieving 25% non-GAAP operating margin and 35% operating cash flow margin at $10 billion in revenue.\nFor Q3, we expect non-GAAP operating margin of 18%. GAAP margins for the third quarter and the full year are expected to be approximately 22 and 23 percentage points lower, respectively, than the non-GAAP margin. The FY '23 non-GAAP tax rate remains at 19%. We're raising our FY '23 guidance for operating cash flow to $1.64 billion. We now expect capital expenditures of $450 million this year to support our customer growth and continued business expansion. As a reminder, during the third quarter, we plan to pay off the principal balance of our $1.15 billion convertible debt in cash. When this occurs, our non-GAAP diluted share count will decrease by roughly 8 million shares. Due to the late Q3 timing, this share reduction will not be fully reflected in our non-GAAP weighted average share count until Q4.\nAnd finally, I'll close by thanking our amazing employees, customers and partners for their continued support and hard work. We look forward to seeing you on September 13, either in-person or virtually, for our Financial Analyst Day, part of the broader Workday Rising program being held in Orlando, Florida, where we'll share more insights on our strategic product initiatives and long-term market opportunity.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to the operator to begin Q&A."

(Operator Instructions) This call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.\nI will now turn the line over to Vincent Zahn, Senior Vice President and Treasurer. Sir, you may begin.\n\nVincent Zahn\n\nThank you, Michelle, and good afternoon, everyone. On the call with me today are Craig Billings and Brian Gullbrants in Las Vegas. Also on the line are Ian Coughlan, Linda Chen, Ciaran Carruthers, Frederic Luvisutto and Jenny Holaday. I want to remind you that we may make forward-looking statements under safe harbor Federal Securities laws, and those statements may or may not come true.\nI will now turn the call over to Craig Billings.\n\nCraig Scott Billings\n\nCEO & Executive Director, Wynn Macau, Limited\n\nThanks, Vince. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I'd like to start by saying that I'm genuinely honored to be speaking to you as the CEO of Wynn Resorts. I joined WYNN in 2017 because I had spent much of my career admiring the company for its dedication to its craft and to its people. I'm excited to lead the company forward, and I know that our best days are ahead of us.\nBefore we talk about the fourth quarter, I'd like to give you some additional context around a couple of transactions that we've announced over the past few weeks.\nFirst, let's touch on the sale leaseback of our real estate at Encore Boston Harbor that we announced today. We discussed the sale of real estate on past earnings calls, and we've always maintained that we believe our valuation over any reasonable period of time reflects the value of our real estate. We believe that to be the case today.\nSo why execute a sale leaseback? A sale-leaseback is after all, nothing more than a financing and capital structure decision. In our case, this transaction benefits our capital structure in a few different ways. First and foremost, it provides long-term capital to grow our business. In this case, capital to deploy adjacent to Encore Boston Harbor in the construction of additional parking and complementary non-gaming amenities that will drive Encore Boston Harbor to even higher levels of performance and capital to deploy an attractive greenfield projects like our development in the UAE, which I will discuss in a moment.\nSecond, it enables us to potentially retire near-term debt with a higher cost of capital than the lease. I would note here that this sale-leaseback transaction was executed at 17x rent or a 5.9% cap rate, a record for regional gaming assets by some 2 turns and an attractive long-term cost of capital.\nThird, it brings a new partner into our capital structure. Sumit and the team at Realty Income have been great partners in executing this transaction. And I would note that there are a number of highly bespoke terms in the lease that reflect our longer-term goals. These terms were only achievable due to the unique way that Realty Income is structured and their willingness to engage and align this transaction with our goals. Overall, this transaction gives us a lot of additional financial flexibility. The transaction will close near the end of the year.\nSome of you may ask, what about Wynn Las Vegas? In response to that, I would note a few important points. First, Las Vegas is a very different market when compared to regional markets. Potential operational deleveraging in an economic downturn is more extreme as we saw in 2009. And the need for continuous and sizable reinvestment in order to stay relevant is high.\nAs many of you know, it is fundamental to us that we maintain consistent service levels and CapEx throughout the business cycle. And I never want us to be in a position where in the midst of a downturn, we have to choose between our world-class service and escrowing rent or between paying rent and investing in our property.\nIn fact, our 2021 results speak to the power of our proprietor's mindset. With a host of new investments bearing fruit and with our team intact despite COVID, we continue to take market share and delivered the property's highest-ever annual EBITDA.\nFurther, the breakage costs related to a sale leaseback of Wynn Las Vegas would be a significant. Beyond the tax leakage, our capital structure in the U.S. has bond financing at both Wynn Las Vegas and a holding company above it.\nA sale of our Las Vegas real estate would trigger an acceleration of that debt, driving over $600 million in breakage. For now, we believe we will deliver far more long-term shareholder value by continuing to own our real estate in Las Vegas, and I am confident our equity valuation will continue to reflect that.\nLet's turn to our announcement regarding an integrated resort development in the UAE. We're thrilled about this project, which will further diversify our business, while extending our brand into the Middle East and Europe. I'm sure all of you are familiar with the UAE and with Dubai in particular. It's a dynamic country and we are proud to have the opportunity to deliver our exceptional hospitality there.\nRas Al Khaimah is about 45 minutes north of the Dubai Airport via a first-class multilane highway. The location on Marjan Island is stunning and will be a great setting for our resort. I do want to provide some clarity on a topic I have seen in a number of analyst notes and media reports regarding the project.\nIn any new jurisdiction, there are 3 things that need to happen to have an integrated resort with gaming. The first is enabling legislation, is gaming legal? The second is, regulation, how will gaming be conducted? The third is, licensure, who can operate a gaming establishment?\nWith respect to this project, no further enabling legislation is required. We're not looking at a multiyear process for legalization like we have seen in some other markets. Regulations are well advanced, having been modeled on those of Singapore and the United States. The tax rate and license structure are very reasonable. And finally, with the regulatory framework taking shape and a regulator in place, we will be licensed to conduct gaming in Ras Al Khaimah. In other words, where we go with these projects.\nWe're commencing master planning now and will begin mobilizing architecture and design in due course. I expect our ultimate design will be one or more iconic buildings that both take advantage of the pristine beach location and also show respect for the unique cultural aspects of the region. We're big believers in the potential for Ras Al Khaimah to be an amazing tourism and hospitality destination.\nLastly, I would point out that this is the first transaction where Wynn Resorts is being paid for its know-how and service excellence via a management agreement. I expect it to provide a very high return on invested capital. We have a lot happening around here, and I'm personally very excited about the future.\nTurning to the fourth quarter and starting in Las Vegas. The team at Wynn Las Vegas had an absolute stunner of the quarter. $186 million of EBITDA despite holding a bit low. Drop was strong, handle was strong, RevPAR was strong, I could go on and on. To us, the quarter's results are a further indication of the fact that our unrelenting focus on service and great product are resonating with premium customers who after being cooped up for 2020 and the first part of 2021 are traveling and spending again with a vengeance.\nAs you've heard from some of our peers, January results in Las Vegas were impacted by Omicron, particularly in the group side. Encouragingly, forward bookings in January were very strong and February to date has accelerated further positioning us well into March and beyond.\nTo give you some context, our hotel occupancy in January was 61%. And with the latest wave of COVID quickly receiving, we expect occupancy to increase to the mid-80s in March. As we increasingly distance ourselves from our competitors, we believe we have strong pricing power on rooms, food and beverage and nightlife during 2022.\nIn Macau, the market continued to experience subdued visitation during the fourth quarter, and our results reflected that in roll, in drop and volatility of hold. Of course, you need to only look at Chinese New Year to remind yourself of the power of that market and the pent-up demand for visitation.\nDuring the holiday period, turnover per day in our direct program was up nearly 175% from 2021 and down only 12% from Chinese New Year 2019. Encouragingly, we are seeing both strong spend per customer and significant new customer sign-ups in our direct business, highlighting the strength of our market-leading product and service offering.\nOn the mass side, table drop was up 34% versus 2021, and that drop was 60% of our Chinese New Year 2019 levels. As we have seen before, when Macau is more accessible, demand snaps right back. Long term, I remain incredibly enthusiastic about the prospects for Macau. Between the shift to higher-margin premium mass customers and to customers who have more motivations to visit than just gaming, the market is evolving, and we are prepared to adapt and grow our business as we embrace those changes.\nFurther, the concession process continues in a methodical and logical manner with the amended gaming law currently sitting with the Assembly Committee. We continue to be pleased with the process and with the content of the amended law.\nTurning to Boston. Like Vegas, Encore had an unbelievable quarter in both gaming volumes and RevPAR, resulting in $68 million of EBITDA in Q4. The team in Boston has really done a tremendous job, particularly in the casino, but we're just getting started. Our next phase of growth in Boston will be driven by database growth, particularly growth outside of adjacent areas and through our upcoming expansion project across the street from the property. That expansion will see us add additional amenities and importantly, additional parking. Parking, particularly on weekends, remains a constraint for us. Though Encore is now run rating higher EBITDA than a number of strip properties, Encore still has a tremendous amount of growth ahead of it.\nLastly, on Wynn Interactive, we generated about $785 million in turnover across casino and sports betting in Q4, which drove a 29% sequential increase in revenue. This was despite a meaningful curtailment in marketing spend in November and December. As you may recall on our Q3 call, we were very explicit about our view on the unsustainable nature of the current competitive environment in sports betting and we stated our intention to manage the business with a long-term shareholder-friendly view.\nTo that end, we began shifting our user acquisition mix in early November, focusing only on proven performance marketing channels where we know we can achieve positive ROI on spend, particularly in casino. By doing this, we meaningfully reduced our overall burn rate and as our remaining brand advertising commitments tailed off with the Super Bowl, I expect EBITDA burn levels to reduce even more drastically.\nOverall, we estimate Q1 2022 burn should be down some 60% from Q3 '21 to the $40 million range, and I expect Q2 2022 to be even lower.\nWith that, I will now turn it over to Vince to run through some additional details on the quarter. Vince?\n\nVincent Zahn\n\nThank you, Craig. At Wynn Las Vegas, we generated a record $186.2 million of adjusted property EBITDA on $493.9 million of operating revenue during the quarter we estimate low table hold negatively impacted EBITDA by approximately $10 million in the quarter. Overall, our hotel occupancy reached 86% in the quarter, with 91% occupancy on weekends.\nImportantly, we have stayed true to our luxury brand and continue to compete on quality of product and service experience, with our overall ADR reaching $441 during 4Q '21, 37% above 4Q '19 levels.\nOur other non-gaming businesses saw broad-based strength across F&B and retail, which were also well above pre-pandemic levels. In the casino, our 4Q '21 slot handle was 40% above 4Q '19 levels, and our table drop was 41% above 4Q '19 levels despite still suppressed international play due to COVID-related travel challenges.\nThe team in Vegas has done a great job of controlling costs without negatively impacting the guest experience, delivering adjusted property EBITDA margin of 37.7% in the quarter or approximately 39% when adjusted for low table hold. This was unchanged sequentially and up 1,350 basis points compared to 4Q '19 on a hold-adjusted basis.\nOpEx per day was $3.18 million in 4Q '21, approximately $145,000 per day above 4Q '19 levels due to a combination of higher cost of goods on materially higher nongaming revenue along with special event costs, including the Koepka-DeChambeau Golf match, among others. We remain committed to maintaining a cost structure that appropriately balances margin and our exacting service standards in Las Vegas.\nIn Boston, we generated another record quarter with adjusted property EBITDA of $68.2 million in 4Q '21, with an EBITDA margin of 33.4%. We saw broad-based strength across the casino combined with solid hotel performance, which was aided by a favorable calendar set up during the quarter.\nAs Craig noted, regarding in Las Vegas and consistent with some of our regional peers, Omicron along with bad weather temporarily disrupted our performance at EBH in January. Encouragingly, we have already seen signs of improvement in the business as case counts have decreased across the region.\nAt EBH, we've remained very disciplined on the cost side with OpEx per day of $1 million in 4Q '21, excluding a $2 million nonrecurring accrual reversal. This was a decrease of over 20% compared to $1.3 million per day in 4Q '19 and a modest increase relative to $950,000 per day in 3Q '21, with the sequential increase driven by improved business volumes and increased operating hours, most notably from the hotel opening of full 7 days per week beginning on September 1.\nLooking ahead, we expect OpEx to increase modestly due to higher payroll, stemming from onetime contractual labor agreements coming into effect in 2022, which will add around $45,000 per day to our OpEx days. We are well positioned to drive strong operating leverage as we continue to grow top line over time in Boston.\nOur Macau operations delivered an EBITDA loss of $25.9 million in the quarter on $325.7 million of operating revenue. Our EBITDA included a onetime bad debt provision that negatively impacted EBITDA by $24 million during the quarter. So we would have been essentially breakeven adjusting for that. While business in 4Q was challenging due to the evolving COVID situation, we remain disciplined on costs.\nOur OpEx, excluding gaming taxes and the onetime provision I noted, was approximately $2.2 million per day in the fourth quarter. essentially unchanged sequentially. We continue to be well positioned to drive strong operating leverage in Macau as our businesses recover.\nTurning to Wynn Interactive. In 4Q, the business generated approximately $785 million in total turnover, a 20% sequential increase relative to 3Q. Top line growth, combined with decreases in marketing spend and other OpEx, drove an improvement in our EBITDA burn rate to $79 million in 4Q '21 versus $104 million in 3Q '21. Since quarter end, we've continued to thoughtfully grow the business with launches in New York and Louisiana, and the initial reception from our customers has been very encouraging.\nTurning to the balance sheet. Our liquidity position remains very strong, with global cash and revolver availability of $3.6 billion as of 12/31. In Macau, we had approximately $1.7 billion of available liquidity as of 12/31. In the U.S., we had total available liquidity of approximately $1.9 billion at 12/31.\nFinally, our CapEx in the quarter was $78 million, and we remain prudent with respect to CapEx while we gain further confidence in the recovery.\nWith that, Michelle, we will now open the call to Q&A."

[Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.\nI will now turn the line over to Julie Cameron-Doe, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.\n\nJulie Mireille Cameron-Doe\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. On the call with me today are Craig Billings and Brian Gullbrants in Las Vegas. Also on the line are [ Linda Chen ], [ Frederic Luvisutto ] and [ Jenny Holiday ].\nI want to remind you that we may make forward-looking statements under safe harbor federal securities laws, and those statements may or may not come true.\nI will now turn the call over to Craig Billings.\n\nCraig Scott Billings\n\nPresident, CFO & Treasurer, Wynn Resorts, Limited\n\nThanks, Julie, and afternoon, everyone, as always. Thanks for joining us today.\nThe momentum that we generated in the business throughout 2023 continued into 2024 as we delivered all-time record property EBITDA of $647 million during the first quarter of 2020. I'm incredibly proud of all of our team members who remain so focused on delivering 5-star service and one-of-a-kind experiences to our guests. A heartfelt thank you to each of you.\nTurning to the quarter and starting here in Vegas. Wynn Las Vegas delivered $246 million of adjusted property EBITDAR, a first quarter record and up 6% year-on-year on a very difficult comp.\nAs we noted on our last call, most of the action in the quarter was concentrated in February as the combination of Super Bowl and Chinese New Year drove all-time record EBITDA during the month.\nQuarter was characterized by strong performance across our non-gaming businesses with revenue growing 16% year-on-year, led by 21% growth in hotel revenue along with healthy volumes in the casino.\nThrough our unique combination of the best service levels in the market, continuous reinvestment in our property and our only at win programming, we continue to fire on all cylinders here in Las Vegas.\nMore recently, our top line trends remained healthy in April with drop, Candle and RevPAR all up year-over-year on yet another difficult comp.\nTurning to Boston. Encore generated $63 million of EBITDAR during the quarter. The team in Boston successfully navigated a confluence of poor weather in January and inflationary pressures during the quarter as EBITDAR and revenue at the property were largely stable year-on-year. There were encouraging pockets of strength in the quarter with record slot handle and strong year-on-year growth in hotel revenue. More recently, demand has remained healthy through April with particular strength in slot handle and RevPAR.\nOn the development across from Encore Boston Harbor, we have put this development on hold for the time being as we have been unable to reach an agreement with local authorities on certain financial terms. Though it's disappointing, we have numerous other development projects globally where we can redirect the capital we intended to deploy in Boston.\nTurning to Macau. We generated $340 million of EBITDA in the quarter on GGR market share that was above both the prior quarter and above our 2019 exit. We held above our expected range. So on a fully normalized basis, EBITDA would have been approximately $320 million. The strength in our business has continued into Q2.\nIn the casino, our mass drop per day in April increased 30% versus April 2019. And on the non-gaming side, our hotel occupancy was 99%. Overall, strong top line performance, combined with disciplined OpEx drove healthy margins during April.\nWe were also pleased with the results during May Golden Week, particularly in light of unfavorable weather in the region. In the casino, mass drop per day increased 30% versus the comparable 2019 holiday period and approach levels seen during last Chinese New Year.\nOn the development front in Macau, we began initial demolition and construction work on our second concession-related project, our destination food home. We are well into design and planning for our other major concession-related CapEx commitments including our new event and entertainment center and a unique theater and show.\nTurning to Wynn Al Marjan in the UAE. Construction is rapidly advancing on the project. And as of this week, we are currently constructing the fourth floor of the hotel tower. You can find recent renderings and images of Wynn Al Marjan in a press release we issued yesterday ahead of a major travel convention taking place this week in Dubai. And I expect we will further update you on the advances we have made on the project later this year.\nFinally, we are actively considering greenfield development opportunities in New York City and potentially Thailand. In New York, we believe a full-scale Wynn integrated resort in Hudson Yards will drive meaningful incremental tax revenue, tourism and employment in the state. Despite the elongation of the RFA submission process in New York, we remain intrigued by the prospect of a Wynn resort in Manhattan.\nIn Thailand, it's early days, and we have yet to see the regulatory and licensing structures. Thailand is already a major tourism destination with significant tourism infrastructure and a world-class service culture so we will continue to closely monitor advancement of the legalization process.\nI remain incredibly bullish about the future of our company. In Las Vegas, we remain at the pinnacle of the market with tremendous demand for what we offer. And in an inflationary environment like this, we have the luxury of being able to reprice our hotel rooms every day in order to take advantage of that demand.\nIn Macau, we continue to punch above our weight on a revenue per hotel room basis generating meaningful market share and substantial discretionary free cash flow. We also have a meaningful high ROI project underway in the UAE, along with potential greenfield developments in other attractive gateway cities.\nMeanwhile, our leverage profile continues to improve as does our outlook on future free cash flow. Our best days lie ahead.\nWith that, I will now turn it over to Julie to run through some additional details on the quarter. Julie?\n\nJulie Mireille Cameron-Doe\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, Craig. At Wynn Las Vegas, we generated $246.3 million in adjusted property EBITDA on $636.5 million of operating revenue during the quarter, delivering an EBITDA margin of 38.7%. Hold was a bit of a mixed bag given results in the Sportsbook, and we estimate a net $5 million benefit from higher than normal hold in the quarter.\nOpEx, excluding gaming tax per day was $4.1 million in Q1 2024, up 9% year-over-year and in line with the increase in operating revenues as we successfully absorbed incremental OpEx related to Super Bowl programming, union-related payroll increases and other inflationary pressures.\nTurning to Boston. We generated adjusted property EBITDA of $63 million on revenue of $217.8 million with an EBITDA margin of 29%. We've stayed very disciplined on the cost side and excluding a $2 million benefit from a onetime item, OpEx per day was $1.19 million in Q1 2024, up around 2% year-over-year. The team has done a great job mitigating union-related payroll increases with cost efficiencies in areas of the business that do not impact the guest experience.\nOur Macao operations delivered adjusted property EBITDA of $339.6 million in the quarter on $998.6 million of operating revenues. As Craig alluded to, we estimate higher than normal hold positively impacted EBITDA by around $19 million during the quarter. VIP hold was largely in the normal range with the hold impact primarily related to higher than normal hold on Wynn Palace mass table games.\nEBITDA margin was 34% in the quarter an increase of 140 basis points relative to Q4 2023 and 310 basis points relative to Q1 2019. Overall, our strong margin expansion relative to 2019 has been driven by a combination of the favorable mix shift to higher-margin mass gaming and operating leverage on cost efficiencies.\nOur OpEx, excluding gaming tax, was approximately $2.6 million per day in Q1, a decrease of 17% compared to $3.2 million in Q1 2019. OpEx increased 3% on a sequential basis, well below the 10% increase in operating revenue. The team has done a great job staying disciplined on costs, and we remain well positioned to drive strong operating leverage as the market continues to recover.\nIn terms of CapEx in Macau, we're currently advancing through the design and planning stages on several of our concession commitments. And as we noted the past few quarters, these projects require a number of government approvals, creating a wide range of potential CapEx outcomes in the near term. As such, we continue to expect CapEx related to our concession commitments to range between $350 million and $500 million in total between 2024 and the end of 2025.\nMoving on to the balance sheet. Our liquidity position remains very strong with global cash and revolver availability of nearly $4.2 billion as of March 31. This was comprised of $2.2 billion of total cash and available liquidity in Macau and approximately $2 billion in the U.S.\nOn the capital markets front, in February, we issued a $400 million add-on to the Wynn Resorts Finance 2031 unsecured notes with net proceeds along with cash on hand used to fund the tender and repurchase of $800 million of Wynn Las Vegas notes maturing in March 2025. Over the past 4 quarters, we've reduced company-wide gross debt by approximately $1 billion. Bringing it all together, the combination of strong performance in each of our markets globally, with our properties generating over $2.3 billion of trailing 12-month property EBITDA together with our robust cash position, creates a very healthy consolidated net leverage ratio of just over 4x.\nOur strong free cash flow and liquidity profile allows us to reduce leverage while returning capital to shareholders. To that end, the Board approved a cash dividend of $0.25 per share payable on May 31, 2024 to stockholders of record as of May 20, 2024.\nAdditionally, in late March, the Wynn Macau Board recommended the reinstatement of a dividend at $0.075 per share or USD 50 million highlighting our commitment to prudently returning capital to shareholders in both the U.S. and Macau.\nFinally, our CapEx in the quarter was $97.7 million primarily related to the Villa renovations and food and beverage enhancements at Wynn Las Vegas, concession-related CapEx in Macau and normal course maintenance across the business. Additionally, we contributed $70 million of equity to the Wynn or Al Marjan Island JV project during the quarter, bringing the total equity contribution to date to approximately $160 million.\nWith that, we will now open up the call to Q&A."

All participants are in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session of today's conference. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the line over to Julie Cameron-Doe, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.\n\nJulie Mireille Cameron-Doe\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThank you operator, and good afternoon, everyone. On the call with me today are Craig Billings; Brian Gullbrants; and Steve Whiteman in Las Vegas. Also on the line are Linda Chen, Frederic Luvisutto and Jenny Holaday. I want to remind you that we may make forward-looking statements under safe harbor federal securities laws, and those statements may or may not come true. I will now turn the call over to Craig Billings.\n\nCraig Scott Billings\n\nPresident, CFO & Treasurer, Wynn Resorts, Limited\n\nThanks, Julie. Afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. Well, what a quarter. Who would have thought just 6 months ago that we would be run rating $2.2 billion of property EBITDA? To put that in context, peak annual property EBITDA for the company was $2 billion in 2018. Yet here we are today. We have a more diversified business with the addition of Encore Boston Harbor. We have a business in Macau that is running structurally higher margins into a resurging market, a business in Las Vegas that is more relevant than ever and is producing nearly double its 2018 EBITDA on much higher margins, and we have a very substantial growth opportunity in the UAE, the most exciting new gaming market in decades.\nI see tremendous value in our business, and I know our brightest days are ahead of us. Our path is the clearest it has been in years, and our team is committed and energized.\nTurning to the quarter and starting in Vegas, Wynn Las Vegas delivered $224 million of adjusted property EBITDA. On a hold-normalized basis, our EBITDA was up 3% on a very difficult year-over-year comp. We saw strength all over the place: the casino, the hotel, the restaurants, retail, you name it, all supported by a consumer that seems more than willing to continue spending on unique luxury experiences. Now we obviously have a very particular customer type skewing heavily to luxury, and we continue to closely monitor whether or not interest rates and inflation begin to impact that consumer. But so far, so good. In fact, drop, handle and RevPAR are all up year-over-year in July. And that's obviously before we get into the latter portion of the year, which has a number of tailwinds from citywide programming.\nTurning to Boston. Like Vegas, Encore had a strong quarter, generating $69 million of EBITDAR, an all-time property record. We generated record GGR in the casino, led by strong growth in slot handle and the addition of retail sports betting earlier this year. On the non-gaming side, we delivered strong hotel revenue, driven by both ADR and occupancy. On the development front in Boston, we're advancing our East of Broadway expansion project now.\nTurning to Macau. We generated $246 million of EBITDA in the quarter, which was 72% of pre-COVID levels. Hold was a bit of a mixed bag in the quarter as we held high in our VIP business, but that was more than offset by low hold on the mass table side. We saw strength across the property with several components of the business above 2019 levels. In the casino, mass table drop increased 4% versus Q2 2019, despite the fact that portions of Wynn Macau's casino were closed for renovation during the quarter. The quality of our product and service, the relaunch of our loyalty program and our very robust nongaming events calendar all helped drive 14.2% market share in the quarter, consistent with our share as we exited 2019.\nOn the non-gaming side, our retail business continues to be incredibly strong, with tenant retail sales increasing 47% relative to 2Q 2019. Looking forward, as you have seen, market-wide GGR momentum in Macau has been impressive, building through the second quarter. The strength has continued into Q3, with mass drop per day in July exceeding what we experienced in each month in Q2 and reaching 120% of daily mass drop in 2019. In July, we also continued to experience robust hotel occupancy and very healthy tenant retail sales. On the development front, we are deep into design and planning for our concession-related CapEx commitments, which we believe will help support Macau's long-term diversification goals and be additive to our business over the coming years.\nLastly, construction is now underway on Wynn Al Marjan Island, our planned integrated resort in the UAE, with our [ seacant ] walls and soil compaction complete and over 40% of the required hotel piles in the ground. As I said earlier, this is the most exciting new market opening in decades, and we will bring our A game to this development. Our 40% equity ownership and management license fees will drive a very healthy ROI for Wynn Resorts shareholders. With that, I will now turn it back to Julie to run through some additional details on the quarter. Julie?\n\nJulie Mireille Cameron-Doe\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, Craig. At Wynn Las Vegas, we generated $224.1 million in adjusted property EBITDA on $578.1 million of operating revenue during the quarter, delivering an EBITDA margin of 38.8%. Slightly lower than normal hold negatively impacted EBITDA by around $2 million in Q2, and hold-normalized adjusted property EBITDA was up 3% year-over-year. Our hotel revenue increased 6% year-over-year to $177.8 million, a new second quarter record, on the back of an increase of 24,000 occupied room nights due to rooms that were out of service for renovations in Q2 2022. ADR occupancy and RevPAR were all up slightly compared to Q2 2022, despite the increase in available room nights, highlighting the appeal of our newly renovated room product. Our other non-gaming businesses saw broad-based strength across food and beverage, entertainment and retail. In the casino, our GGR increased around 2% year-over-year, driven by a 14.8% year-over-year increase in slot handle and table drops that was roughly flat.\nTurning to Boston. We generated adjusted property EBITDA of $69.1 million, an all-time property record. EBITDA margin was 31.1%, up 80 basis points year-over-year. We saw broad-based strength across casino and nongaming during the quarter. In the casino, we generated $193 million of GGR, a property record, with strength in both tables and slots. Our nongaming revenue grew 3.8% year-over-year to $55.1 million, with particular strength in hotel and food and beverage. We've stayed very disciplined on the cost side, with OpEx, excluding gaming tax per day, of approximately $1.15 million in Q2 2023, up 3.6% year-over-year on increased business volumes and down 1% sequentially.\nAs you may have seen in the press, we were pleased to recently sign new union agreements that provide our employees with competitive wages, benefits and a best-in-class working environment that reflects our Wynn service standards. We expect the incremental OpEx from the new agreements to be partially offset by cost efficiencies we have identified in areas of the business that do not impact the guest experience. Additionally, I would like to note that business volumes in Q3 are temporarily being negatively impacted by the Sumner Tunnel restoration project the City of Boston is conducting that will be ongoing through August 31. The impact is primarily being felt in our table games business, as both slots and nongaming revenue continued to grow year-on-year in July.\nOur Macau operations delivered adjusted property EBITDA of $246.2 million in the quarter on $769.9 million of operating revenue. As Craig noted, we held high in our VIP business, but this was more than offset by lower-than-expected hold on the mass table side. We were encouraged by the meaningful uptick in visitation and demand we experienced during the quarter, with particular strength in mass casino drop, direct VIP turnover, luxury retail sales and hotel revenue all above Q2 2019 levels. EBITDA margin was 32% in the quarter, an increase of 280 basis points relative to Q2 2019, with Wynn Palace's margin reaching 33.4%, or 690 basis points above Q2 2019 levels.\nEBITDA margin strength was driven by a combination of a favorable mix shift to higher-margin mass gaming and operating leverage on cost efficiencies. In fact, our OpEx, excluding gaming tax, was approximately $2.2 million per day in Q2, a decrease of 29% compared to $3.2 million in Q2 2019 and down 2% from Q1 despite the meaningful sequential increase in business volumes. The team has done a great job remaining disciplined on costs, and we're well positioned to continue to drive strong operating leverage as the business recovers over time.\nIn terms of CapEx, we're currently advancing through the design and planning stages on our concession commitment. And as we noted in the past few quarters, these projects require a number of government approvals, creating a wide range of potential CapEx in the very near term. As such, for 2023 through 2024, we expect CapEx related to our concession commitments to range between $300 million and $400 million.\nTurning to Wynn Interactive, our EBITDA burn rate decreased both sequentially and year-over-year to $15 million in Q2 2023. Our team continues to stay disciplined on costs while driving improved marketing efficiencies.\nMoving on to the balance sheet. Our liquidity position remains very strong with global cash and revolver availability of approximately $4.7 billion as of June 30. This was comprised of $1.8 billion of total cash and available liquidity in Macau and $2.9 billion in the U.S. Importantly, the combination of strong performance in each of our markets globally with our properties run rating approximately $2.2 billion of annualized property EBITDA, together with our robust cash and liquidity, creates a very healthy leverage profile for the company globally.\nWe're also pleased to announce that the Board approved a cash dividend of $0.25 per share payable on August 31, 2023, to stockholders of record as of August 21, 2023, highlighting our commitment to returning capital to shareholders. Finally, our CapEx in the quarter was $92 million, primarily related to the [ far biller ] renovations and food and beverage enhancements at Wynn Las Vegas and normal course maintenance across the business. With that, we'll now open up the call to Q&A."

(Operator Instructions) This call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I will now turn the line over to Julie Cameron-Doe, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.\n\nJulie Cameron-Doe\n\nCFO, Aristocrat Leisure Limited\n\nThank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. On the call with me today are Craig Billings, Brian Gullbrants and Steve Weitman in Las Vegas. Also on the line are Ian Coughlan, Linda Chen, Frederic Luvisutto and Jenny Holaday. I want to remind you that we may make forward-looking statements under safe harbor federal securities laws, and those statements may or may not go true. I will now turn the call over to Craig Billings.\n\nCraig Scott Billings\n\nCEO, Treasurer & Director, Wynn Resorts, Limited\n\nThanks, Julie. Afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. As we prepared for this call, I looked at an old analyst note that was published after our Q4 2019 earnings. The expectation for 2022 EBITDAR at Wynn Las Vegas in that note was $482 million.\nHere we are 3 years in the global pandemic later and Wynn Las Vegas just printed $816 million of normalized adjusted property EBITDAR, $816 million. I'm confident that this is an all-time record for a stand-alone Las Vegas Strip property. And mind you, we did not deliver this result by nickel and diming on service standards and reducing staff to drive operating leverage.\nThe team did it by focusing on what we do best. Great products, great service, great programming, and it showed in our market share and pricing power. The Wynn Las Vegas team absolutely crushed it in 2022. Our business in Vegas is stronger and more relevant than it has ever been.\nI'll talk more about the fourth quarter in Vegas in our outlook in a moment. Turning to several other significant events. I'd like to touch on our concession renewal and the reopening of Macau. I was in Macau for nearly 3 weeks in December. And after going through the then required quarantine, I was fortunate to attend the signing ceremony for our new concession.\nI'm proud of the plan that we put forward as part of the concession renewal and believe that the CapEx and programming we proposed will be additive to our business there over the coming years. I would like to thank the government of the Macau for their faith in us. And importantly, I would like to thank the Wynn Macau team for their dedication to our business over the past 3 very difficult years.\nFortunately, recent actions by both Macau and Mainland authorities to reopen the market give us great confidence that the difficulties are behind us in the near-term future there are much brighter. Over the past several weeks, we've welcomed back an increasing number of guests as the region has reopened to travel and tourism in a meaningful way.\nWith our premium product and service levels, we are well positioned to lead the post-COVID recovery in Macau, and our strengths were evident during the recent Chinese New Year holiday period. In the casino, mass table drop reached 95% of 2019 Chinese New Year levels with strong play across the spectrum from premium mass to core mass.\nIn direct VIP turnover was 40% above pre-COVID Chinese New Year levels. And importantly, we estimate that our hold-normalized GGR market share during the month of January was consistent with 2019 levels despite all the changes in the junket environment, define the expectations of those who continue to incorrectly believe that we are solely of VIP-focused organization.\nOn the non-gaming side, hotel occupancy was 96%, and our tenant retail sales increased 34% compared to Chinese New Year 2019. Overall, during the Chinese New Year period, we delivered our strongest EBITDAR performance since the onset of the pandemic, approximately $4 million of normalized EBITDAR per day.\nTurning back to Las Vegas. The team at Wynn Las Vegas turned in a fourth quarter record with $219 million of EBITDAR. We saw broad-based strength across casino, hotel, F&B, entertainment and retail, all well above Q4 2021 levels despite the difficult year-over-year comps. Our investment in people, facilities and programming and our team's deep sense of personal ownership of our business continue to drive growth.\nWe continue to monitor economic trends and forward bookings at Wynn Las Vegas. We're encouraged that the strength we have experienced over the past several quarters has continued into Q1. Similarly, our forward-looking indicators also remain quite strong despite well-known macro concerns as room bookings are pacing at or above pre-COVID-19 levels on substantially higher ADRs.\nTurning to Boston. Like Vegas, Encore had a strong quarter, generating $63 million of EBITDAR. We saw strength across the casino with record gross gaming revenue and on the non-gaming side with strong hotel revenue driven by both ADR and occupancy. The strength has continued into the first quarter with EBITDAR per day in January, largely consistent with trends we have experienced over the past few quarters.\nWe were also pleased to launch retail sports betting at Encore Boston Harbor last week, averaging a little over $0.5 million a day in handle over the first 6 days, which is about 80% of the average daily handle at Wynn Las Vegas.\nDuring those 6 days, we also signed up about 30% more Wynn Rewards members than normal. We continue to expect the book to be a significant driver for new customer acquisition over time. We also continue to advance our plans for our upcoming development project across the street from the property that will include incremental parking, food and beverage and entertainment amenities.\nAt Wynn Interactive, our overall EBITDAR burn rate in the quarter ticked up sequentially to $28 million due to a well-publicized World Series bet that went against us. Adjusted for that single bet, burn was roughly flat. Our team continues to stay disciplined on cost while driving improved marketing efficiency. We're looking forward to the potential for a significant catalyst for WynnBET in Massachusetts with the combination of our recently launched retail book and the expected upcoming launch of online sports betting.\nLastly, we are quickly advancing our planning for Wynn Al Marjan Island, our integrated resort in the UAE. We're in the late stages of programming for the resort, and I expect we will be driving piles for the foundation of the property by the middle of the year. I also expect we will share renderings, programming and plans publicly over the next few months.\nThe more time we spend in that market, the more confident we are in the project. With that, I will now turn it over to Julie to run through some additional details on the quarter. Julie?\n\nJulie Cameron-Doe\n\nCFO, Aristocrat Leisure Limited\n\nThank you, Craig. At Wynn Las Vegas, we generated a fourth quarter record of $219.3 million in adjusted property EBITDAR on $585.5 million of operating revenue during the quarter, lower-than-normal hold negatively impacted EBITDAR by around $10.5 million in Q4. Our hotel occupancy was 89.9% in the quarter, up 350 basis points year-over-year and up 50 basis points versus Q4 2019.\nImportantly, we've stayed true to our luxury brand and continue to compete on quality of product and service experience with our overall ADR reaching a record $492 during Q4 2022, up 11.8% versus Q4 2021 and 53% above Q4 2019 levels. Our other non-gaming businesses saw broad-based strength across F&B, entertainment, and retail, which were up nicely year-over-year and also well above pre-pandemic levels.\nIn the casino, our Q4 2022 slot handle increased 20.9% year-over-year and with 69% of Q4 2019 levels. Similarly, our table drop was up 1.1% year-over-year and was 43% above Q4 2019 levels despite still suppressed international play during the quarter due to COVID-related travel challenges. The team in Vegas has done a great job of controlling costs without negatively impacting the guest experience, delivering adjusted property EBITDAR margin of 37.4% in the quarter.\nOn a hold-normalized basis, our EBITDAR margin was up approximately 1,300 basis points compared to Q4 2019. OpEx, excluding gaming tax per day was $3.8 million in Q4 2022, up 25% compared to Q4 2019 levels but well below the 59% increase in operating revenue.\nIn Boston, before getting into the details, I'd like to point out that following the closing of the sale leaseback transaction on December 1, we're now reporting adjusted profit to EBITDAR for this business.\nIn Q4 2022, we generated adjusted property EBITDAR of $63.3 million with EBITDAR margin of 29%. We saw broad-based strength across casino and non-gaming during the quarter. In the casino, we generated $190 million of GGR, a property record with strength in both tables and slots. Our non-gaming revenue grew 13% year-over-year to a record $56.8 million with particular strength in the hotels, driven by 93.9% occupancy and a $404 ADR.\nWe've stayed very disciplined on the cost side with OpEx, excluding gaming tax per day of approximately $1.17 million in Q4 2022. This was a decrease of over 8% compared to $1.3 million per day in Q4 2019 and up modestly relative to Q3 2022. As we've discussed on prior calls, the year-over-year EBITDAR and OpEx comps were impacted by a combination of contractual labor agreements, which added around $45,000 per day to our OpEx base beginning late in Q2 2022, along with a non-recurring benefit of $2 million in Q4 last year. We're well positioned to drive strong operating leverage as we continue to grow the top line over time.\nOur Macau operations delivered an EBITDAR loss of $59.1 million in the quarter on $190.3 million of operating revenues, lower than normal hold negatively impacted EBITDAR by around $25 million in Q4. While the COVID situation in the region was challenging during Q4, as Craig noted, we were encouraged by the meaningful uptick in visitation and demand we experienced during the recent Chinese holiday period.\nOur OpEx, excluding gaming tax, was approximately $2 million per day in Q4, a decrease compared to $2.4 million in Q4 2021. The team has done a great job remaining disciplined on costs in a difficult operating environment. Longer-term, we are well positioned to drive strong operating leverage as the business recovers over time.\nIn terms of the new concession, we approach the tender process very prudently, carefully balancing our commitments to the government with our responsibilities to our shareholders and, of course, our liquidity position. We're currently advancing through the design and planning stages, for these projects require a number of government approvals creating a wide range of potential CapEx in the very near-term.\nAs such, for 2023, we expect CapEx related to our concession commitments to range between $50 million to $220 million. Our future non-gaming investments, including new theater set to be home of a unique spectacle show and innovative food halls and an events and entertainment center. As Craig noted, we believe these investments play into our strength as we have a demonstrated track record of introducing innovative non-gaming investments that drive increased tourism and ultimately, strong shareholder returns.\nTurning to Wynn Interactive. Our EBITDAR burn rate increased sequentially to $28.3 million in Q4 2022. However, adjusting for the well-publicized World Series that Craig mentioned, it was roughly flat with our Q3 2022 burn rate of $17.7 million.\nThe team continues to control costs while driving improved marketing efficiencies. Moving on to the balance sheet. Our liquidity position remains very strong with global cash and revolver availability of approximately $4.5 billion as of December 31. This was comprised of $952 million of total cash and available liquidity in Macau and $3.5 billion in the U.S.\nThese numbers exclude the undrawn $500 million intercompany revolving credit facility when results entered into with Wynn Macau. We were pleased to close the sale leaseback transaction for the real estate of Encore Boston Harbor on December 1 with gross proceeds of $1.7 billion, further bolstering our already strong liquidity position.\nImportantly, the combination of very strong performance in Las Vegas and Boston, with the properties generating $1.04 billion of adjusted property EBITDAR during 2022 together with our robust liquidity creates a very healthy leverage profile in the U.S.\nWith our properties performing well in each of our markets and our robust liquidity, I'd like to note our intention to repay our upcoming May 2023, Wynn Las Vegas bond maturity with cash from the balance sheet, reducing our domestic gross leverage by $500 million.\nFinally, our CapEx in the quarter was $27 million, primarily related to normal course maintenance. With that, we'll now open up the call to Q&A."

All participants are on a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session of today's conference. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I will now turn the line over to Julie Cameron-Doe, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.\n\nJulie Mireille Cameron-Doe\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. On the call with me today are Craig Billings and Brian Gullbrants in Las Vegas. Also on the line are Linda Chen, Frederic Luvisutto and Jenny Holaday. I want to remind you that we may make forward-looking statements under safe harbor federal securities laws, and those statements may or may not come true. I will now turn the call over to Craig Billings.\n\nCraig Scott Billings\n\nPresident, CFO & Treasurer, Wynn Resorts, Limited\n\nThanks, Julie. Good afternoon, and as always, thank you for joining us today. I want to start by saying thank you to my nearly 28,000 colleagues here at Wynn Resorts for delivering yet another record quarter. In this case, the best second quarter EBITDAR in the history of the company at $572 million. record quarters like this one further strengthen our conviction when deploying capital, whether through CapEx or share repurchases like those we executed in the second quarter and into the third quarter.\nWynn Las Vegas delivered $230 million of adjusted property EBITDAR, a second quarter record and up 3% year-on-year on yet another very difficult comp, taking trailing 12-month EBITDAR to nearly $970 million. The quarter was led by 16% growth in hotel revenue along with 8% growth in slot handle and healthy table drop in the casino. Wynn Las Vegas continues to have the top-performing team here in Vegas. More recently, demand has remained healthy in 3Q with RevPAR up and slot handle broadly in line year-on-year during July, despite this year having 2 fewer weekend days.\nTurning to Boston. Encore generated $62 million of EBITDAR during the quarter. Lower than normal table hold masked what was actually a strong quarter across the property with record slot handle, strong table drop and record RevPAR in the hotel. More recently, demand has remained healthy through July with table drops, slot handle and RevPAR all up on a tough year-on-year comp.\nTurning to Macau. We generated $280 million of EBITDAR in the second quarter on slightly lower market share than we have experienced over the previous several quarters and slightly lower mass hold quarter-over-quarter. There has been a lot of chatter in the market about the elevated promotional environment in Macau with concessionaires jockeying for market share.\nOf course, while we are active every day in the hand-to-hand combat for market share, you can't take market share to the bank, and thus, we have remained -- we have continued to remain disciplined in our OpEx and player reinvestment levels, highlighted by our strong EBITDAR margin in the quarter, which was 250 basis points above 2Q 2019. We've seen this dynamic before, and we remain confident that our market-leading product and service levels position us well to compete effectively in the long term.\nTo that end, we were encouraged that our GGR market share moved back to our expected range in July, supported by strong mass table drop and 99% hotel occupancy during the month. Wynn Macau's long-term outlook remains very bright.\nOn the development front, we continue to elevate our product offering in Macau through new and innovative food and beverage concepts and unique programming. We also continue to advance construction work on our second major concession-related project, our destination food hall, which we expect to open in 2025.\nTurning to our Wynn Al Marjan Island development in the UAE. I just returned from several weeks in Dubai and Ras Al Khaimah. Construction is rapidly progressing on the project with work now approaching the 15th floor of the hotel. The building now stands just over 90 meters, which is already the tallest building in the Emirate.\nDuring the second quarter, we contributed $357 million of equity to our UAE joint venture. This transaction included the purchase of our 40% pro rata share of all 155 acres of Island Three, the island on which Wynn Al Marjan sits. As a result, our joint venture now owns not only the land under Wynn Al Marjan, but also 70-plus acres of land for potential future development on the Island. Of course, we have banked land before in the U.S. and Macau, and we are confident that acquiring this sizable Marjan land bank will prove valuable over the long term.\nAs I have noted before, I believe the UAE is the most exciting new market for our industry in decades and our confidence in the demand and EBITDAR potential of Wynn Al Marjan continues to grow. We also made meaningful progress during the quarter on the debt financing for the project and expect that we will finalize that financing later in 2024. I remain incredibly bullish about the future of our company. We have the best assets in the world's premier gaming markets. We also have an exciting high ROI development project in the UAE well underway, a development opportunity that is unique in our industry. And we are exploring potential greenfield opportunities in attractive gateway cities like New York and Bangkok.\nMeanwhile, our leverage profile continues to improve as free cash flow grows, allowing us to increase the return of capital to shareholders through the recurring dividend and opportunistic share repurchases. Our best days lie ahead. With that, I will now turn it over to Julie to run through some additional details on the quarter. Julie?\n\nJulie Mireille Cameron-Doe\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, Craig. At Wynn Las Vegas, we generated $230.3 million in adjusted property EBITDAR on $628.7 million of operating revenue during the quarter, delivering an EBITDAR margin of 36.6%. Lower-than-normal table games hold negatively impacted EBITDAR by around $5 million in Q2. OpEx, excluding gaming tax per day was $4.2 million in Q2 compared to $3.7 million in the prior year period. The increase was primarily due to union-related payroll increases, along with higher variable costs due to increased volumes across the business.\nTurning to Boston, we generated adjusted property EBITDAR of $62.1 million on revenue of $212.6 million with an EBITDAR margin of 29.2%. As Craig alluded to, our table game hold was below normal during the quarter. And if we normalize hold in both periods, EBITDAR would have increased approximately 2% year-on-year. We've stayed very disciplined on the cost side with OpEx per day of $1.15 million, flat year-on-year and down sequentially. The team has done a great job mitigating union-related payroll increases with cost efficiencies in areas of the business that do not impact the guest experience.\nOur Macau operations delivered adjusted property EBITDAR of $280.4 million in the quarter on $885.3 million of operating revenue. Hold was a mixed bag in the quarter as higher than normal hold at Palace was more than offset by lower than normal hold at Wynn Macau, particularly in our mass table business. All in, we estimate hold negatively impacted EBITDAR at the combined properties by around $3 million during the quarter. EBITDAR margin was 31.7% in the quarter, an increase of 250 basis points relative to Q2 2019. Our OpEx, excluding gaming tax, was approximately $2.5 million per day in Q2, a decrease of 19% compared to $3.2 million in Q2 2019 and down 3% on a sequential basis.\nThe team has done a great job of staying disciplined on costs, and we remain well positioned to drive strong operating leverage as the market continues to recover. In terms of CapEx in Macau, we're currently advancing through the design and planning stages on several of our concession commitments. And as we noted in the past few quarters, these projects require a number of government approvals, creating a wide range of potential CapEx outcomes in the near term. As such, we continue to expect CapEx related to our concession commitments to range between $350 million and $500 million in total between 2024 and the end of 2025.\nMoving on to the balance sheet. Our liquidity position remains very strong with global cash and revolver availability of over $3.9 billion as of June 30. This was comprised of $2.2 billion of total cash and available liquidity in Macau and $1.7 billion in the U.S. During the quarter, we continued to reduce gross debt, repaying approximately $170 million on our bank facilities, and we have now reduced company-wide gross debt by more than $1.1 billion over the past year.\nThe combination of strong performance in each of our markets globally with our properties generating nearly $2.4 billion of trailing 12-month property EBITDAR, together with our robust cash position creates a very healthy consolidated net leverage ratio of just over 4x. Our strong free cash flow and liquidity profile allows us to reduce leverage while returning capital to shareholders in both the U.S. and Macau. To that end, the Wynn Resorts Board approved a cash dividend of $0.25 per share payable on August 30, 2024, to stockholders of record as of August 19, 2024.\nWe also opportunistically repurchased approximately 741,000 shares for $68 million during the quarter. Similarly, in June, Wynn Macau paid a dividend of $0.075 per share or USD 50 million, highlighting our commitment to prudently returning capital to shareholders. Finally, our CapEx in the quarter was $94 million, primarily related to the Villa renovations and food and beverage enhancements at Wynn Las Vegas, concession-related CapEx in Macau and normal course maintenance across the business. Additionally, as Craig noted, we contributed $356.5 million of equity to the Wynn Al Marjan Island project during the quarter, bringing our total equity contribution to date to $514.4 million, split approximately $300 million for Wynn Al Marjan and a little over $200 million for the Marjan land bank and related infrastructure.\nWe estimate our remaining 40% pro rata share of the required equity is approximately $900 million, fully loaded to capitalized interest, fees and certain improvements on the island. Importantly, as Craig noted, we've also made meaningful progress on the debt financing for the project with significant interest from a diverse group of banks, both locally and the region as well as internationally. We expect the financing will be completed later this year, and we will update you in due course. With that, we will now open up the call to Q&A."

Also on the line are Linda Chen, Frederic Luvisutto and Jennie Holiday.\nI want to remind you that we may make forward-looking statements under safe harbor federal securities laws, and those statements may or may not come true.\nI will now turn the call over to Craig Billings.\n\nCraig Scott Billings\n\nPresident, CFO & Treasurer, Wynn Resorts, Limited\n\nThanks, Julie. Good afternoon, everyone, and as always, thank you for joining us today.\nI'll start here in Vegas. Wynn Las Vegas delivered $220 million of adjusted property EBITDA, up 12% on an incredibly difficult year-over-year comp. Yes, it was aided by high hold, but it was also despite the fact that we accrued during the quarter for the estimated increases associated with the new agreement with the culinary union. I got to tell you, activity at the property was frenetic during the quarter, with hotel occupancy restaurant covers casino visitation, table drop and slot handle all up over what was a very strong third quarter of 2022. As a result of all that activity, we produced third quarter records in gross gaming revenue, food and beverage revenue and hotel revenue with 10% year-over-year growth in RevPAR.\nWe continue to be at the top of our game here in Las Vegas, and I'm incredibly proud of the team who continue to deliver to our exacting standards even in the midst of significant customer volumes. Our top line trends remained strong through October with healthy GGR and strong year-over-year RevPAR growth during the month.\nLooking ahead, we have a strong pipeline of forward group demand, very healthy gaming market share and a robust programming calendar with F1 and Super Bowl just ahead of us. And while it certainly is an increasingly complex world out there between inflation, rates, geopolitics, things continue to feel pretty good around here.\nTurning to Boston. Encore generated $60 million of EBITDA during the quarter. Business at the property was largely stable year-on-year with revenue and EBITDA down about 1%, though there were some meaningful pockets of strength, including all-time property records for slot handle and hotel revenue. More recently, we were encouraged by the acceleration in the business we experienced during October with month-over-month growth in slot handle and table drop and strong RevPAR growth year-over-year. We will continue to closely monitor the ongoing Sumner Tunnel construction, which is expected to continue in fits and starts over the next 12 months, along with the general macroeconomic uncertainty that seems to have been impacting some of the regional gaming operators.\nOn the development across the street from Encore Boston Harbor, we have been asked by a state environmental agency to provide yet another round of analysis and documentation delaying our construction by approximately 3 months. We will continue to update you on this project, which will add meaningful amenities and EBITDA to Encore Boston Harbor.\nTurning to Macau, we generated $255 million of EBITDA in the quarter, which was 85% of our pre-COVID levels. Hold was mixed in the quarter as we held high in our VIP business, which was more than offset by low hold on the mass table side. With mass now comprising the vast majority of our business, we are going to start normalizing for both VIP and MAX. To that end, we estimate fully normalized EBITDA in the quarter was $266 million or 87% of the third quarter of 2019 levels. Encouragingly, mass hold returned to the expected range at both properties in October. During the quarter, we saw broad-based strength across our properties with several key areas of the business trending well above 2019 levels.\nIn the casino, mass table drop increased 19% versus Q3 2019 and direct VIP turnover was 13% above Q3 2019. On the non-gaming side, our retail business continues to be incredibly strong with tenant retail sales up 24% on Q3 2019, and hotel revenue up 20% relative to the third quarter of 2019. Quality of our product and service, our relaunch wind Rewards loyalty program and our very robust non-gaming events calendar all helped to drive GGR market share in the quarter that was consistent with second quarter and in line with our share as we exited 2019. The strength in our business has continued in Q4 with mass drop in October, 24% above October 2019. The hotel occupancy and healthy tenant retail sales. On the development front in Macau, we expect our first concession-related capital project, a collaboration with the team behind Las Vegas-based Aluminarium on a mesmerizing multimedia exhibit space to open before the end of the year. We're also deep into design and planning for our other concession-related CapEx commitments, including our destination food hall the new event and entertainment center and a unique spectacle show. Lastly, construction continues on Wynn Al Marjan Island, our planned integrated resort in the UAE.\nMuch of the Hotel Tower Foundation is complete with nearly all of the piles supporting the 1,500 room tower in the ground. On the back of several recent regulatory developments in the UAE, I've noticed increased chatter about the opportunities there. So I want to take a moment and give you our perspective. We believe it's highly unlikely that every Emirate will ultimately avail themselves of the right to host an integrated resource. There's a whole bunch of reasons for this, ranging from cultural nuances to population density to varying degrees of need for the additional visitation. Our view is that it will likely be us and us alone for a multiyear period, given that we are well underway on construction now. And of course, we all know the advantages of being first as we have seen in other markets. After that, it may be a duopoly or an oligopoly of 3. But I find either ultimate market structure undaunting, given the database advantages of being first and the fact that we very successfully operate in the 2 most competitive markets in the world, Vegas and Macau. As I've said before, this is the most exciting new market opening in decades.\nWith that, I'll now turn it over to Julie to run through some additional details on the quarter.\n\nJulie Mireille Cameron-Doe\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, Craig. At Wynn Las Vegas, we generated $219.7 million in adjusted property EBITDA on $619 million of operating revenue during the quarter, delivering an EBITDA margin of 35.5%, higher than normal hold benefited EBITDA by around $12 million in Q3 and hold-normalized adjusted property EBITDA was up slightly year-over-year. The strength in the quarter was broad-based across the business. Hotel revenue increased 10% year-over-year to $178.5 million, a new third quarter record on the back of a 9% increase in ADR and 120 basis point increase in occupancy. Our other non-gaming businesses were strong across food and beverage, entertainment and retail, all up nicely year-on-year.\nIn the casino, our GGR increased around 22% year-over-year, driven by a 7.6% year-over-year increase in slot handle and a 6.5% increase in table drop along with higher table games hold. OpEx, excluding gaming tax per day was $4.1 million in Q3 2023, up 14% year-over-year due to variable costs associated with revenue increases, roughly $10 million of nonrecurring items and certain structural changes including an accrual for the anticipated increases associated with a new union contract, our annual cost of living adjustments for nonunion employees and the launch of our production show.\nTurning to Boston. We generated adjusted property EBITDA of $60.5 million on revenue of $210.4 million, both down around 1% year-on-year. EBITDA margin was 28.8%, broadly in line with Q3 2022. As Craig noted, business was largely stable year-on-year. In the casino, we generated $182.6 million of GGR, down 1% year-on-year as record slot handle was offset by lower table games volumes. Our non-gaming revenue was flat year-over-year at $54.4 million with record hotel revenue offset by lower food and beverage revenues. As noted on our prior call and as Craig mentioned earlier, business volumes at the property were impacted by the Sumner Tunnel restoration project, which is expected to continue intermittently over the next 12 months or so. While the tunnel construction is out of our control, we have stayed very disciplined on the cost side with OpEx, excluding gaming tax of approximately $1.13 million per day in Q3 2023, down 0.5% year-over-year and down around 2% sequentially. The team has done a great job mitigating union-related payroll increases with cost efficiencies in areas of the business that do not impact the guest experience.\nOur Macao operations delivered adjusted property EBITDA of $255 million in the quarter on $819.8 million of operating revenue. We estimate lower-than-normal hold negatively impacted EBITDA by around $11 million during the quarter with higher than normal hold at Wynn Palace more than offset by lower than normal hold at Wynn Macau. We saw particular strength in [Indiscernible] direct CIP turnover, luxury retail sales and hotel revenues, all above Q3 2019 levels.\nEBITDA margin was 31.1% in the quarter, an increase of 300 basis points relative to Q3 2019 with Wynn Palace's margins reaching 33.7% or 660 basis points above Q3 2019 levels. Our concession-related non-gaming programming have accelerated over the past few months, with the favor 3x3 basketball tournament that Di Vinci Immersive Art Exhibition, a Hypercar Exhibition, some DJ events and several other well-received concerts and culinary events. EBITDA margin strength was driven by a combination of a favorable mix shift to higher-margin mass gaming and operating leverage on cost efficiencies.\nOur OpEx, excluding gaming tax, was approximately $2.4 million per day in Q3, a decrease of 20% compared to $3 million in Q3 2019. The team has done a great job remaining disciplined on costs, and we are well positioned to continue to drive strong operating leverage as the business recovers over time. In terms of CapEx, we are currently advancing through the design and planning stages on our concession commitments and as we noted in the past few quarters, these projects require a number of government approvals, creating a wide range of potential CapEx in the very net terms. As such, we expect CapEx related to our concession commitments to range between $300 million and $400 million in total between Q4 2023 and the end of 2024.\nTurning to Wind Interactive. You will recall we announced in August that we decided to rationalize the business to primarily focus on Massachusetts and Nevada, where we have a physical presence. As a result, our EBITDA burn rate decreased substantially both sequentially and year-over-year to $4.9 million in Q3 2023.\nMoving on to the balance sheet. Our liquidity position remains very strong with global cash and revolver availability of approximately $4.3 billion as of September 30. This was comprised of $1.8 billion of total cash and available liquidity in Macau and $2.5 billion in the U.S. Importantly, the combination of strong performance in each of our markets globally with our properties run rating over $2.1 billion of annualized property EBITDA, together with our robust cash and liquidity creates a very healthy leverage and free cash flow profile for the company globally.\nTo that end, we repurchased $400 million of our 2025 Wynn Las Vegas senior notes at a discount to par during the quarter. Further, the board approved a cash dividend of $0.25 per share payable on November 30th to stockholders of record as of November 20, 2023. We also repurchased approximately 597,000 shares, $56.2 million during the quarter, highlighting our commitment to prudently returning capital to shareholders.\nFinally, our CapEx in the quarter was $114 million, primarily related to the [Indiscernible] Villa renovations and food and beverage enhancements that Wynn Los Vegas. Concession-related CapEx in Macau and normal course maintenance across the business.\nWith that, we will now open up the call to Q&A."

(Operator Instructions) This call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.\nAnd I will now turn the line over to Julie Cameron-Doe, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.\n\nJulie Cameron-Doe\n\nCFO, Aristocrat Leisure Limited\n\nThank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. On the call with me today are Craig Billings and Brian Gullbrants in Las Vegas. Also on the line are Ian Coughlan, Linda Chen, Frederic Luvisutto and Jenny Holaday. I want to remind you that we may make forward-looking statements under safe harbor federal securities laws, and those statements may or may not come true.\nI will now turn the call over to Craig Billings.\n\nCraig Scott Billings\n\nCEO, Treasurer & Director, Wynn Resorts, Limited\n\nThanks, Julie. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. Before I get into the quarter, I'd like to thank the cast, crew and producers of Awakening, our new show at Wynn Las Vegas, which successfully opened on Monday. The show is yet another example of our willingness to innovate and push the envelope to drive the strip forward. I'm incredibly proud of the team behind the show.\nI'll kick off in Las Vegas, where the team turned in a third quarter record with $196 million of EBITDA or approximately $207 million adjusted for lower-than-normal holds. We saw broad-based strength across casino, hotel, food and beverage and retail, all well above third quarter 2021 levels despite the difficult year-over-year comps. The comparison to third quarter 2019 is even more impressive with our EBITDA more than doubling on a 36% increase in revenue. Our investment in people, facilities and programming and our team's deep sense of ownership continue to elevate Wynn Las Vegas above our peers. This quarter once again highlights the benefit of that deliberate investment strategy.\nLooking ahead, encouraged that the strength we have experienced over the past several quarters has continued into the fourth quarter. In fact, our EBITDA during October was an all-time monthly record for the property. Similarly, our forward-looking indicators also remain quite strong despite well-known macro concerns as room bookings are pacing at or above pre-COVID levels on substantially higher ADRs. Near term, we expect the normal seasonal pattern to hold during the remainder of Q4, with some of the usual softness surrounding Thanksgiving, followed by a strong close to the year in the latter half of December.\nTurning to Boston, like Vegas, Encore had a strong quarter, generating $61 million of EBITDA. We saw strength across the casino with record gross gaming revenue and on the nongaming side with record hotel revenue driven by strength in both ADR and occupancy. These trends have continued into Q4, with EBITDA per day in October consistent with the third quarter levels.\nLooking ahead, we remain excited about sports betting in the Commonwealth, which is expected to kick off early next year. Our retail sports book there will soon be a significant opportunity for customer acquisition. We also continue to finalize our plans for our upcoming development project across the street from the property that will add incremental parking, food and beverage and entertainment amenities.\nIn Macau, the market continues to be challenging with market-wide GGR in the third quarter only reaching approximately 8% of the third quarter of 2019 levels, and our results have reflected that. Our team has done a fantastic job controlling costs in a very challenging operating environment through a combination of decreases in payroll and fixed OpEx. As a result, despite the nearly 2-week closure of casinos in the market in July, our overall EBITDA loss in the third quarter was $66 million, which was a meaningful improvement from a loss of $90 million in the second quarter even after adjusting for a $7 million bad debt credit that benefited the results in the third quarter.\nMore recently, we did see some encouraging pockets of demand during the October holiday period, particularly in our direct VIP business, where turnover was actually slightly above the comparable 2019 holiday period. And in our retail business, where tenant sales reached 74% of 2019 levels. This once again highlights the strong demand for Macau's unique tourism offering during periods when the market is accessible.\nThe authorities in Macau continued to advance the concession process according to the preestablished time line. We were pleased to submit our concession tender application in September, and the government is currently reviewing the proposals with decisions expected to be made by year-end. Long term, we remain excited about the prospects from Macau with so much pent-up demand for travel and tourism in Asia.\nAt Wynn Interactive, our overall EBITDA burn rate declined to $18 million in Q3 from $21 million in the second quarter of 2022, on the back of strong cost controls and improved marketing efficiency. We are looking forward to the potential for a significant catalyst for Wynn in Massachusetts.\nLastly, we're advancing quickly on our planning for Wynn Marjan, our integrated resort in the UAE. We're in the late stages of programming for the resort. Given the pristine beach setting and the somewhat malleable nature of the man-made island, we have an incredible canvas with which to work and design something truly unique. I expect we will share renderings, programming and plans more publicly in early 2023. I also expect we will be driving piles for the foundation of the property by the middle of next year. We look forward to sharing more details with you about this exciting project in due course.\nWith that, I'll turn it back to Julie to run through some additional details on the quarter.\n\nJulie Cameron-Doe\n\nCFO, Aristocrat Leisure Limited\n\nThank you, Craig.\nAt Wynn Las Vegas, we generated a third quarter record of $195.8 million in adjusted property EBITDA on $544.4 million of operating revenue during the quarter. Lower-than-normal hold negatively impacted EBITDA by about $12 million in Q3. Our hotel occupancy was 88.8% in the quarter, up 580 basis points year-over-year and up 90 basis points versus Q3 2019. Importantly, we've stayed true to our luxury brand and continue to compete on quality of product and service experience. With our overall ADR reaching $426 during Q3 2022, up 8.7% versus Q3 2021 and 39% above Q3 2019 levels. Our other nongaming businesses saw broad-based strength across food and beverage and retail, which were up nicely year-over-year and also well above prepandemic levels.\nIn the casino, our Q3 2022 slot handle increased 31.6% year-over-year and was 72.2% above Q3 2019 levels. Similarly, our table drop was up 12.5% year-over-year, and was 32.4% above Q3 2019 levels despite still suppressed international play during the quarter due to COVID-related travel challenges.\nThe team in Vegas has done a great job of controlling costs without negatively the guest experience, delivering adjusted property EBITDA margin of 36% in the quarter. On a hold-normalized basis, our EBITDA margin was up approximately 1,300 basis points compared to Q3 2019.\nOpEx, excluding gaming tax per day, was $3.6 million in Q3 2022, up 10% compared to Q3 2019 levels, but well below the 36% increase in revenue due to lower headcount and broad-based cost efficiencies in areas that do not impact the guest experience. We remain committed to maintaining a cost structure that appropriately balances margins and our exacting service standards. In Boston, we generated adjusted property EBITDA of $61.1 million in Q3 2022 with EBITDA margin of 28.9%.\nWe saw broad-based strength across casino and nongaming during the quarter. In the casino, we generated $184 million of GGR, a property record with strength in both tables and slots. Our nongaming revenue grew 33% year-over-year, with particular strength in the hotel, driven by 97% occupancy and a $398 ADR. We stayed very disciplined on the cost side with OpEx, excluding gaming tax per day, of approximately $1.1 million in Q3 2022. This was a decrease of over 10% compared to $1.3 million per day in Q4 2019 and broadly in line with Q2 2022.\nAs we've discussed on prior calls, the year-over-year EBITDA and OpEx comps were impacted by a combination of contractual labor agreements, which added around $45,000 per day to our OpEx base beginning late in Q2 2022, along with a onetime benefit of $3 million in Q3 of last year. We're well positioned to drive strong operating leverage as we continue to grow the top line over time.\nOur Macau operations delivered an EBITDA loss of $65.6 million in the quarter on $115.6 million of operating revenue as the COVID situation in the region has continued to suppress visitation. As Craig noted, while the business has remained challenging, we experienced some encouraging pockets of demand during the October Golden Week holiday period, particularly in our direct VIP and retail businesses.\nOur OpEx, excluding gaming tax, was approximately $1.6 million per day in Q3, a sequential decrease compared to $1.9 million per day in Q2 2022. The team has done a great job remaining declined on costs in a difficult operating environment. Longer term, we're well positioned to drive strong operating leverage as the business recovers over time.\nTurning to Wynn Interactive. Our EBITDA burn rate improved to $17.7 million in Q3 2022, from $21 million in Q2 2022, primarily driven by improved marketing efficiency and disciplined OpEx control.\nMoving on to the balance sheet. Our liquidity position remains very strong with global cash and revolver availability of approximately $2.8 billion as of September 30. This was comprised of $997 million of total cash and available liquidity in Macau and $1.8 billion in the U.S. These numbers exclude the undrawn $500 million intercompany revolving credit [facility, Wynn Resorts entered into] with Wynn Macau.\nOur previously announced sale leaseback transaction for the real estate of Encore Boston Harbor remains on track to close before the end of the year. Pro forma for the transaction, we have approximately $4.4 billion of consolidated global cash and liquidity.\nImportantly, the combination of very strong performance in Las Vegas and Boston, with the properties generating trailing 12-month EBITDA of over $1 billion, together with our robust liquidity, creates a very healthy pro forma leverage profile in the U.S. Finally, our CapEx in the quarter was $87 million, primarily related to the Awakening theater at Wynn Las Vegas and normal course maintenance.\nWith that, we will now open up the call to Q&A."

Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Before getting into the quarter, I'd really like to thank our 27,000 team members globally. 2020 so far has been very different in Macau than it has been in North America. Our folks in Macau have endured what I know is a difficult period of isolation and volatility while our teams in Las Vegas and Boston have responded admirably to meaningfully elevated business volumes.\nTo those operating in both circumstances, thank you. I appreciate you. Starting in Las Vegas. The team at Wynn Las Vegas turned in another all-time record quarter with $227 million of EBITDA and broad-based strength across casino, hotel, food and beverage and retail, all well above 2Q 2019 levels. In fact, our EBITDA this quarter was over 40% above the pre-COVID Las Vegas Strip EBITDA record also delivered by Wynn Las Vegas in 2014.\nA few other all-time quarterly records to call out: record EBITDA margin, record slot handle in Wynn, record non-baccarat table Wynn, record hotel revenue and record revenue from restaurants and bars. Meanwhile, our customer satisfaction scores in the first half of 2022 were up 3% over the first half of 2019. Our performance in Las Vegas speaks for itself.\nLooking ahead, while we are keenly aware of the macro environment and the uncertainty facing the economy, we've been encouraged that the strength we have experienced over the past several quarters has continued into Q3. In fact, our forward bookings continue to pace at pre-COVID levels on substantially higher ADRs. July was very strong for us with occupancy of 91%.\nWe expect the usual seasonal slowdown in August with occupancy declining in the mid- to high 80s before accelerating back to the low 90s in September as group's return in large numbers. While we haven't seen any noticeable signs of weakness in our current operations or in our outlook, we are watching this closely. Our experience during the pandemic has made us nimbler than ever, and we are confident that we can adapt quickly to changes in the economic landscape, should they arise.\nTurning to Boston. Encore also had a great quarter, generating $64 million of EBITDA, a second quarter record for the property. We saw strength across the casino with record gross gaming revenue, and on the non-gaming side, we generated record hotel revenue with particular strength in cash ADR and occupancy. The positive momentum has continued into Q3. And again, similar to Las Vegas, we have yet to see signs of a slowdown. We were happy to see the Massachusetts legislature pass the sports betting bill and having already constructed a Sports Book at Encore Boston Harbor in 2021, we expect that retail sports betting will soon be a significant opportunity for property-wide customer acquisition in Boston.\nWe also continue to finalize our plans for our upcoming development projects across the street from the property that will add incremental parking, food and beverage and entertainment amenities. Design and planning for that project is on schedule, and we are excited for our next phase of growth in Boston.\nIn Macau, the market continues to be very difficult with market-wide GGR in July, only reaching approximately 2% of July '19 levels. Our results have reflected that in roll, drop, hotel occupancy and EBITDA. Overall, our EBITDA loss in Q2 was $90 million, which was negatively impacted by around $8 million from low VIP holds. So on a normalized basis, our EBITDA loss was $900,000 per day in 2Q. And despite the nearly 2-week market-wide casino closure in July, our EBITDA loss has been comparable at approximately $1 million per day quarter-to-date in Q3. Our team has done a fantastic job controlling costs in a very challenging operating environment through a combination of decreases in payroll and fixed OpEx.\nSeveral weeks ago, we announced some important leadership changes in Macau with Linda Chen moving into the role of President early next year; Frederic Luvisutto moving into the role of COO for the entire Macau business; and Craig Fullalove, assuming the role of CFO and CIO for the business. I know many of you know and as I do respect Ian immensely, so I'm pleased that he will remain at the company in an advisory role through 2023. I have immense confidence in Linda, Frederic and Craig and know that they are the right team for the future.\nThe authorities in Macau continue to advance the concession process according to the preestablished time line. We're currently working through our response to the concession tender RFP. Longer term, we remain excited about the prospects for Macau with so much pent-up demand for travel and tourism in Asia. Our market-leading assets and strong liquidity position us well to thrive as visitation returns to the market over time.\nAt Wynn Interactive, the strategy we implemented late last year to manage the business with a long-term shareholder-friendly view is working with our overall EBITDA burn rate declining to $21 million in Q2 from $32 million in 1Q, despite a 3% quarter-over-quarter decline in total turnover due to the seasonally weak second quarter sports calendar. We are looking forward to the potential for a significant catalyst for WynnBET in Massachusetts both in digital and retail sports betting.\nLastly, the design and programming for our project in the UAE are really coming along, and I grow more excited about the opportunity every day. The project parking along a beautiful white sand beach will contain a 200,000 square foot casino, an extensive food and beverage portfolio and numerous forms of entertainment and spectacle. The more time I spend in this project, the more I'm convinced in our ability to build robust gaming and non-gaming businesses.\nWith that, I'll now turn it over to Julie to run through some additional details on the quarter. Julie?\n\nJulie Cameron-Doe\n\nCFO, Aristocrat Leisure Limited\n\nThank you, Craig. At Wynn Las Vegas, we generated an all-time quarterly record of $226.7 million of adjusted property EBITDA on $561.1 million of operating revenue during the quarter. Higher than normal hold positively impacted EBITDA by around $6 million in Q2.\nOur hotel occupancy was 90.5% quarter, up 40 basis points versus Q2 2019. Importantly, we stayed true to our luxury brand and continue to compete on quality of product and service experience with our overall ADR reaching $460 during Q2 2022, 38% above Q2 2019 levels.\nOur other non-gaming businesses saw broad-based strength across food and beverage and retail, which were also well above pre-pandemic levels.\nIn the casino, our Q2 2022 slot handle was 63% above Q2 2019 levels, and our table dropped was 28% above Q2 2019 level, despite still suppressed international plays during the quarter due to COVID-related travel challenges.\nThe team in Vegas has done a great job of controlling costs without negatively impacting the guest experience, delivering adjusted property EBITDA margin of 40.4% in the quarter. On a hold-normalized basis, our EBITDA margin was up over 1,200 basis points compared to Q2 2019.\nOpEx, excluding gaming tax per day was $3.5 million in Q2 2022, in line with Q2 2019 levels despite a 21% increase in revenue due to lower head count and broad-based cost efficiencies in areas that do not impact guest experience. We remain committed to maintaining our cost structure that appropriately balance the market on our guest service standards.\nIn Boston, we generated adjusted property EBITDA at $63.7 million through Q2 2022, with EBITDA margin at 13.3%. We saw broad-based strength across casino and non-gaming. In the casino, we generated $181 million of GGR, a property record with strength across both tables and slots. Our non-gaming revenue grew 78% year-over-year with particular strength in the hotel, driven by 94.1% occupancy and a [$309] APR.\nAs Craig noted earlier, Q2 strength continued into Q3 as consumer spending on the unique experience remains strong. We stay disciplined on the cost side with OpEx, excluding gaming tax per day of approximately $1.1 million in Q2 2022. This was a decrease of approximately 13% compared to $1.3 million per day in Q4 2019 and up modestly relative to Q1 2022 on higher revenue and higher payroll. As we've previously foreshadowed, contractual labor agreements added around $45,000 per day for our OpEx base beginning late in the quarter. We are well positioned to drive strong operating leverage as we continue to grow the top line over time.\nOur Macau operations delivered a EBITDA loss of $90.3 million in the quarter on $117.2 million of operating revenue as the COVID situation in the region has continued [press visitation].\nAs Craig noted, lower-than-normal VIP holds negatively impacted our EBITDA by around $8 million during the quarter. Businesses remained challenging into Q3 as local COVID outbreaks in Macau observed a shutdown of integrated resorts for nearly 2 weeks during July. Despite the closure, our quarter-to-date EBITDA burn was approximately $1 million per day, in line with Q2.\nOur OpEx, excluding gaming tax, was approximately $1.9 million per day in Q2, a sequential decrease compared to $2.1 million in Q1 2022. The team has done a great job remaining disciplined on costs in a difficult operating environment. Longer term, we're well positioned to drive strong operating leverage as the business recovers over time.\nTurning to Wynn Interactive . In Q2, the business generated approximately $704 million in total turnover, a decline of 3% sequentially versus Q1 due to a seasonally weaker sport calendar. Decreases in marketing expense and other OpEx drove an improvement in our EBITDA burn rate of $21 million in Q2 2022 from $31.5 million in Q1 2022.\nMoving on to the balance sheet. Our liquidity position remains very strong with global cash and revolver availability of approximately $3.1 billion as of June 30. This is comprised of $1.3 billion of total cash and available liquidity in Macau and $1.7 billion in the U.S. These numbers exclude the $500 million intercompany revolving credit facility, Wynn Resort and Wynn (inaudible) with Wynn Macau, which further bolsters our already strong liquidity position in Macau and highlights the continued confidence we have in the long-term prospects for that business.\nOur previously announced sale leaseback transactions at a real estate Encore Boston Harbor remains on track for a Q4 close. Pro forma for the transaction, we have approximately $4.7 billion of consolidated global cash and liquidity. Importantly, the combination of very strong performance in Las Vegas and Boston with the property generating trailing 12-month EBITDA of just over $1 billion together with our robust liquidity creates a very healthy pro forma domestic leverage profile. Finally, our CapEx in the quarter was $90 million primarily related to the Wynn Las Vegas room remodel and the theater renovation.\nWith that, we'll now open up the call to Q&A."

[Operator Instructions]. This call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.\nI will now turn the line over to Julie Cameron-Doe, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.\n\nJulie Mireille Cameron-Doe\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. On the call with me today are Craig Billings, Brian Gullbrants and Steve Whiteman in Las Vegas. Also on the line are Linda Chen, Frederic Luvisutto and Jenny Holiday. I want to remind you that we may make forward-looking statements under safe harbor federal securities laws, and those statements may or may not come true.\nI will now turn the call over to Craig Billing.\n\nCraig Scott Billings\n\nPresident, CFO & Treasurer, Wynn Resorts, Limited\n\nGood afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us again today. Well, what a quarter. And really what a year, every single member of the wind team should be incredibly proud of what they achieved together in 2023. Momentum in the business built throughout the year, and we ended on a high note with $632 million of property EBITDA, an all-time quarterly record, capping off a record year in which we generated nearly $2.2 billion of property EBITDA.\nWe see tremendous value in our business as evidenced by our buybacks in the quarter and are genuinely looking forward to 2024. The company is more diversified than it's ever been.\nIn Las Vegas, we continue to distance ourselves from peers as the leader in luxury and it's more evident than ever that we are the go-to spot for the best customers attending citywide events like F1. We have a growing business in Macau that is running structurally higher margins than in the past, is much less reliant on the volatile VIP segment and is increasingly well positioned to compete.\nAnd importantly, we have a substantial growth opportunity in the UAE that will further diversify our portfolio and expand our brand into new markets.\nTurning to the quarter and starting here in Vegas. Wynn Las Vegas delivered $271 million of adjusted property EBITDA, an all-time quarterly record, up 24% year-on-year on a very difficult comp. While F1 was clearly a contributor, activity of the property was intense throughout the quarter, with RevPAR table drop slot handle and food and beverage revenue all well above what was a very strong quarter in 2022.\nIn fact, we had our best October, our best November and our best December ever in terms of EBITDA during Q4. We continue to fire on all cylinders here in Las Vegas, and I'm incredibly proud of the Vegas team.\nMore recently, January 2024 looked a lot like January 2023 from an overall revenue perspective with hotel revenue particularly strong. That being said, January isn't where the action is this quarter. It's all about February. Super Bowl, Chinese New Year and for us, the best February in our history for group and convention.\nBetween Super Bowl and Chinese New Year, we have doubled the front money and credit that we had in 2023, and we expect record hotel revenue over Super Bowl. So a very active February will really set the tone for the first quarter.\nTurning to Boston. Encore generated $64 million of EBITDA during the quarter, similar to many other regional markets, demand at the property was largely stable year-on-year. Revenue decreased by about 0.5%, but the team has done a great job remaining disciplined on OpEx, driving a 2% year-over-year increase in EBITDA.\nMore recently, underlying demand has remained healthy through January although a couple of unfortunately timed winter storms had negatively impacted visitation during a few recent weekends.\nOn the development across from Encore Boston Harbor, we recently received a key environmental approval and we are advancing through a few remaining items before construction can be yet.\nTurning to Macau. We generated $297 million of EBITDA in the quarter on market share that was consistent with the prior quarter and with 2019. While we held in the normal range in mass, we held a bit high in VIP. So on a fully normalized basis, EBITDA would have been approximately $290 million or 94% of Q4 2019 levels. The strength in our business there has continued into Q1. In the casino, our mass drop per day in January increased 32% versus January 2019 and was up sequentially versus Q4.\nOn the non-gaming side, our hotel occupancy was 99%, along with continued strength in tenant retail sales. Overall, strong top line performance, combined with disciplined OpEx control drove healthy margins during the month of January.\nOn the development front, we opened our first major concession-related capital project during Q4, a collaboration with the team behind Las Vegas-based Aluminarium and initial customer feedback has been positive. We are deep into design and planning for our other concession-related CapEx commitments, including our Destination Food Hall, the new event and entertainment center and a unique production show.\nLastly, turning to Wynn Al Marjan, construction continues on the project with much of the hotel tower and podium foundation now complete, and we are nearly ready to start going vertical on the hotel tower. Property is really going to be a stunner, and it's great to see the buildings start to take shape.\nWith that, I'll now turn it over to Julie to run through some additional details on the quarter.\n\nJulie Mireille Cameron-Doe\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, Craig. In Las Vegas, we generated $270.8 million in adjusted property EBITDA on $696.8 million of operating revenue during the quarter, delivering an EBITDA margin of 38.9%, up 140 basis points year-on-year. Higher than novel table games hold benefited EBITDA by around $10 million in Q4.\nOpEx, excluding gaming tax per day was $4.4 million in Q4 '23, up 16% year-over-year, well below the 19% increase in revenue. The sequential increase in OpEx was primarily driven by higher programming and staffing costs related to F1.\nTurning to Boston. We generated adjusted property EBITDA of $64.4 million on revenue of $217.1 million with an EBITDA margin of 29.7%. We've stayed very disciplined on the cost side with OpEx, excluding gaming tax of $1.14 million per day in Q4 '23, down 2% year-over-year, driving a 70 basis point increase in EBITDA margin. The team has done a great job mitigating union-related payroll increases with cost efficiencies in areas of the business that do not impact the guest experience.\nOur Macao operations delivered adjusted property EBITDA of $297 million in the quarter on $910.6 million of operating revenues. As Craig alluded to, we estimate higher-than-expected hold positively impacted EBITDA by around $7 million during the quarter. Importantly, mass hold at both properties within the expected range during the quarter with the hold impact primarily related to the VIP side of the business.\nEBITDA margin was 32.6% in the quarter, an increase of 140 basis points relative to Q4 2019, driven by a combination of the favorable mix shift to higher-margin mass gaming and operating leverage on cost efficiencies.\nOur OpEx, excluding gaming tax was approximately $2.56 million per day in Q4, a decrease of 14% compared to $3 million in Q4 2019. The team has done a great job remaining disciplined on costs and we're well positioned to continue to drive strong operating leverage as the market continues to recover.\nIn terms of CapEx in Macau, we're currently advancing through the design and planning stages on our concession commitments. And as we noted in the past few quarters, these projects require a number of government approvals, creating a wide range of potential CapEx outcomes in the near term. As such, we expect CapEx related to our concession commitments to range between $350 million and $500 million in total between 2024 and the end of 2025.\nMoving on to the balance sheet. Our liquidity position remains very strong with global cash and revolver availability of nearly $4.5 billion as of December 31. This was comprised of $2 billion of total cash and available liquidity in Macau and approximately $2.45 billion in the U.S. Bringing it all together, the combination of strong performance in each of our markets globally with our properties generating nearly $2.2 billion of property EBITDA in 2023. Together with our robust cash and liquidity position, creates a very healthy leverage and free cash flow profile for the company globally.\nFurther, the Board approved a cash dividend of $0.25 per share payable on February 29, 2024, to stockholders of record as of February 20, 2024. We also repurchased approximately 1.6 million shares to $139 million during the quarter, highlighting our commitment to prudently returning capital to shareholders.\nWe will consider additional dividend increases at Wynn Resorts and the initiation of the dividend from Wynn Macau as the recovery progresses and the exact timing of our global capital deployment plans become more clear.\nFinally, our CapEx in the quarter was $113 million, primarily related to the par Villar renovations and food and beverage enhancements at Wynn Las Vegas concession-related CapEx in Macau and normal course maintenance across the business.\nWith that, we will now open up the call to Q&A."

[Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.\nI will now turn the line over to Cameron -- I'm sorry, to Julie Cameron-Doe, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.\n\nJulie Cameron-Doe\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. On the call with me today are Craig Billings and Brian Gullbrants in Las Vegas. Also on the line are Linda Chen, Frederic Luvisutto and Jenny Holaday.\nI want to remind you that we may make forward-looking statements under safe harbor federal securities laws, and those statements may or may not come true.\nI will now turn the call over to Craig Billings.\n\nCraig Scott Billings\n\nPresident, CFO & Treasurer, Wynn Resorts, Limited\n\nThanks, Julie. Afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. Before we get into the specifics of the quarter, I'm pleased to say that after 3 years of suspension, today, we announced that we are resuming payment of a quarterly dividend, initially $0.25 per share. We have a number of growth projects in flight that require capital and will ultimately add meaningful EBITDA to our business. But with Macau returning to profitability and North America continuing to perform well above historical levels, we have sufficient financial flexibility to also return capital to shareholders.\nI also want to express appreciation to our 27,000-plus team who were once again recently recognized by Forbes Travel Guide with 24 Five Star Awards, the most of any independent hotel company in the world. Thank you for all that you do.\nTurning to Las Vegas. I have to tell you, it's a fascinating time in our business. Despite the confluence of high inflation, high interest rates, bank failures and increasingly difficult year-over-year comps, Wynn Las Vegas delivered an all-time record in Q1 with $232 million of adjusted property EBITDA, supported by a consumer that continues to feel flush. We also subsequently delivered the best April in the history of the property. We continue to invest heavily in people, programming and the building to further distance ourselves as the clear leader in luxury in Vegas.\nLooking ahead, we currently have a strong pipeline of forward group demand, continued rooms pricing power, healthy drop in handle and a robust programming calendar, particularly in the back half of the year. Yet I continue to watch the macro factors that I mentioned earlier, and I will note that with Q2 '23, we will begin comping against some very strong prior year quarters. Lastly, just as I have the past several quarters, I will continue to tell you exactly what we're seeing. And right now, things feel good around here.\nTurning to Boston. Like Vegas, Encore had a strong quarter, generating $63 million of EBITDAR. We saw strength across the casino in terms of table drop, slot handle and overall GGR. On the nongaming side, we delivered strong hotel revenue driven by both ADR and occupancy. The strength has continued into Q2 with EBITDA per day in April largely consistent with trends we have experienced over the past few quarters.\nWe also launched retail sports betting at Encore Boston Harbor in Q1, which helped drive a 20% increase in sign-ups to our Wynn Rewards loyalty program year-to-date. I expect the book will continue to be a significant driver for new customer acquisition over time.\nOn the development front in Boston, we finalized the interiors and began to buy out structural materials for our upcoming projects across the street from the property that will add incremental parking, food and beverage and entertainment amenities.\nTurning to Macau. We generated $156 million of EBITDA in the quarter with lower-than-normal VIP hold negatively impacting EBITDA by about $10 million. In the casino, mass table drop reached 82% of Q1 2019 levels, and our VIP hold normalized market share was over 14% during the quarter despite unusually low hold in our mass business at Wynn Macau and the fact that significant portions of Wynn Macau's East casino were closed for renovation during the quarter. Encouragingly, that market share was consistent with full year 2019 levels.\nOn the nongaming side, our retail business was incredibly strong with tenant retail sales increasing 60% compared to the first quarter of 2019, once again highlighting the strength of our premium consumer.\nLooking forward, as you have seen, market-wide GGR momentum in Macau has been very impressive, building through the first quarter and accelerating into April. Who would have thought even 6 months ago that the market would be run rating north of $22 billion of annual GGR.\nIn April, our mass drop per day increased versus Q1, our direct VIP turnover per day increased meaningfully versus Q1, and occupancy and retail sales were very healthy. More recently, the May Golden Week holiday period was particularly strong, outperforming Golden Week 2019 in several key areas. In the casino, our overall mass table drop during the holiday period was nearly 10% above 2019 Golden Week levels, and our direct VIP turnover was more than double 2019 levels.\nOutside of gaming, our tenant retail sales increased 36% compared to Golden Week 2019, and our hotel occupancy was 95%. Performance during and after the quarter was skewed towards Wynn Palace driven both by the mix of customers that have returned to Macau in the initial reopening wave and the renovation-related closures at Wynn Macau that I mentioned earlier. We are making a number of changes and improvements to Wynn Macau that I expect will drive longer-term market share gain. In the meantime, I expect that Wynn Palace will continue to pace ahead of Wynn Macau in the recovery.\nOn the development front in Macau, we are deep into design and planning for our concession-related CapEx commitments, which we believe will help support Macau's long-term diversification goals and be additive to our business over the coming years. We look forward to telling you more in due course.\nLastly, I hope that you were all able to review the information we provided a couple of weeks ago on Wynn Al Marjan Island, our planned integrated resort in the UAE. If you haven't listened to the presentation or read through the slide deck, you can find both on our IR website. I'm incredibly proud of the program and design elements we have put together thus far. And as we noted in the presentation, we think the resort will generate between $450 million and $600 million of steady-state EBITDA. The combination of our 40% equity ownership in the project along with our management and license fees will drive a very healthy ROI for Wynn Resorts shareholders.\nWith that, I'll now turn it back to Julie to run through some additional details on the quarter.\n\nJulie Cameron-Doe\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, Craig. At Wynn Las Vegas, we generated an all-time record of $231.6 million in adjusted property EBITDA on $586.8 million of operating revenue during the quarter. Higher-than-normal hold positively impacted EBITDA by around $4 million in Q1. Our hotel occupancy was 88.8% in the quarter, up 1,190 basis points year-over-year and up 620 basis points versus Q1 2019. Importantly, we've stayed true to our luxury brand and continue to compete on quality of product and service experience with our overall ADR reaching a record $493 during Q1 '23, up 14.1% versus Q1 '22 and 46% above Q1 2019 levels.\nOur other nongaming businesses saw broad-based strength across food and beverage, entertainment and retail, which were up nicely year-over-year and also well above pre-pandemic levels. In the casino, our Q1 '23 slot handle increased 33.5% year-over-year and with 99% of our Q1 2019 level. Similarly, our table drop was up 9.6% year-over-year and was 49% of our Q1 2019 levels. The team in Vegas has done a great job of controlling costs without negatively impacting the guest experience, delivering adjusted property EBITDA margin of 39.5% in the quarter.\nOn a hold-normalized basis, our EBITDA margin was up approximately 300 basis points year-over-year at approximately 1,400 basis points compared to Q1 2019. OpEx excluding gaming tax per day was $3.7 million in Q1 '23, which was flat sequentially and up 20% compared to Q1 2019 levels but well below the 46% increase in operating revenues.\nTurning to Boston. We generated adjusted property EBITDA of $63.4 million with EBITDA margin of 29.3%. We saw broad-based strength across casino and nongaming during the quarter. In the casino, we generated $191 million of GGR, a property record with strength in both tables and slots. Our nongaming revenue grew 21% year-over-year to $50.9 million with particular strength in hotel and food and beverage. We've stayed very disciplined on the cost side with OpEx excluding gaming tax per day of approximately $1.17 million in Q1 '23. This is up relative to Q1 '22 on increased business volumes and flat sequentially.\nAs we've discussed on prior calls, the year-over-year EBITDA and OpEx comps were impacted by contractual labor agreements, which added around $45,000 per day to our OpEx base beginning late in Q2 '22. We're well positioned to drive strong operating leverage as we continue to grow the top line over time.\nOur Macau operations delivered adjusted property EBITDA of $155.8 million in the quarter on $600.1 million of operating revenues. Lower-than-normal VIP hold negatively impacted EBITDA by around $10 million in Q1. As Craig noted, we were encouraged by the meaningful uptick in visitation and demand we experienced during the quarter with particular strength in mass casino and luxury retail sales. Our OpEx excluding gaming tax was approximately $2.3 million per day in Q1, a decrease compared to $3.2 million in Q1 2019 and up modestly from Q4 despite meaningful sequential increase in business volumes. The team has done a great job remaining disciplined on costs, and we're well positioned to drive strong operating leverage as the business recovers over time.\nIn terms of CapEx, we're currently advancing through the design and planning stages on our concession commitments. And as we noted last quarter, these projects require a number of government approvals, creating a wide range of potential CapEx in the very near term. As such, for 2023, we continue to expect CapEx related to our concession commitments to range between $50 million to $220 million.\nTurning to Wynn Interactive. Our EBITDA burn rate decreased both sequentially and year-over-year to $21.1 million in Q1 '23. Our team continues to stay disciplined on cost while driving improved marketing efficiencies.\nMoving on to the balance sheet. Our liquidity position remains very strong with global cash and revolver availability of approximately $4.7 billion as of March 31. This was comprised of $1.6 billion of total cash and available liquidity in Macau and $3.1 billion in the U.S.\nImportantly, the combination of very strong performance in Las Vegas and Boston with the properties generating over $1.1 billion of adjusted property EBITDA in the 12 months through March 31, together with our robust liquidity, creates a very healthy leverage profile in the U.S.\nAs Craig noted, with our properties performing well in each of our markets and our robust liquidity, we're pleased to announce that the Board approved the resumption of our quarterly dividend with a cash dividend of $0.25 per share payable on June 6, 2023, to stockholders of record as of May 23, 2023, highlighting our commitment to prudently returning capital to shareholders.\nFinally, our CapEx in the quarter was $124 million primarily related to the spa and villa renovations and F&B enhancements at Wynn Las Vegas and normal course maintenance across the business.\nWith that, we will now open up the call to Q&A."

Today's conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions) And now at this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Paul Johnson, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nPaul Andrew Johnson\n\nVP of IR, Xcel Energy Inc.\n\nGood morning, and welcome to Xcel Energy's 2021 Year-end Conference Call. Joining me today are Bob Frenzel, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Van Abel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In addition, we have others from our management team here to help answer any questions you might have.\nThis morning, we will review our 2021 results and share recent business and regulatory developments. Slides that accompany today's call are available on our website. As a reminder, some of the comments made during today's call may contain forward-looking information significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our SEC filings.\nToday, we will discuss certain metrics that are non-GAAP measures. Information on the comparable GAAP measures and reconciliations are included in our earnings release.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to Bob.\n\nRobert C. Frenzel\n\nPresident, CEO & Chairman, Xcel Energy Inc.\n\nThank you, Paul, and good morning, everyone. Before we walk through year-end results, I want to reflect on the devastating wildfires that tour through Boulder County, Colorado just before the new year. It's been a long 4 weeks since this historic tragedy ravaged our communities and resulted in 2 people losing their lives and over 1,200 homes and buildings being destroyed or damaged. Our hearts and thoughts are with all members of these communities who lost their homes, suffered damage or were displaced, including 17 of our own employees and their families. I'm truly grateful for our hundreds of employees, contractors and partners who exercised incredible diligence in keeping each other and our customers safe, while working around the clock to get the lights and the heat back on especially over a holiday weekend with below 0 temperatures and more than a foot of fresh snow in some areas.\nMore than 100,000 electric customers experienced a sustained outage and service was largely restored within 48 hours. Our wildfire protocols require that we turn off natural gas service to over 13,000 customers as a safety precaution. And once it was safe, our employees with mutual aid assistance went door-to-door to manually relight pilot lights, restoring service within just 3 days. In addition to our crews, I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to our many employees and community members who volunteered alongside emergency responders, handing out space heaters and water bottles and collecting clothing donations. I'm so proud of how our team and partners led with compassion and deliver for our customers and communities in this extreme time of need.\nOfficials continue to investigate the cause of the fire, but they confirmed there were no down power lines in the ignition area. Our systems remain resilient even as when 100-mile per hour winds propelled the fires due to our previously approved wildfire mitigation plan and our continued focus on operational excellence. As we always do, our team rallied to the call guided by our 4 values connected, committed, trustworthy and safe.\nMoving on to our 2021 results. We had another very successful year, continuing to execute on our strategy while delivering strong financial and operational performance. First and foremost, throughout the pandemic, we continue to provide safe, reliable service to our customers and support to our employees and our communities. Financially, we delivered EPS of $2.96 representing 17th consecutive year of meeting or exceeding our earnings guidance. We raised our annual dividend for the 18th straight year, increasing it by $0.11 per share. We reached constructive rate case settlements in Colorado, Texas, New Mexico, Wisconsin, North Dakota and Michigan. We also reached constructive settlements in several additional regulatory proceedings in Colorado, including Yuri storm cost recovery, our resource plan and the pathway transmission project, and we anticipate commission decisions on these settlements by the end of the first quarter.\nOur nuclear fleet remains the top-performing fleet in the country, achieved a capacity factor of over 92% last year. We also installed over 300,000 smart meters as part of our advanced grid program and plan to install more than 1 million in 2022. Continue to lead the country in carbon reduction, in 2021 our estimated carbon emissions were approximately 50% below 2005 levels, and we remain on track to achieve 80% carbon reduction by 2030.\nAs planned, we completed 4 wind farms with 800 megawatts of capacity, which provides significant environmental benefits and cost savings for our customers. we also accelerated our time line for transitioning out of coal and now expect to be coal-free by the end of 2034. 2021, we extended our clean energy leadership to our natural gas business, committing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25% by 2030 and deliver net 0 natural gas service by 2050 for scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions.\nWe continue to execute on our electric vehicle vision, implementing 12 new programs for our customers receiving approval for our New Mexico plan and preparing for increased levels of electric vehicle adoption across our 8 states. We're also recognized for our continued ESG leadership, named among the world's both ethical companies, the best veteran employers and for disability inclusion in the workplace.\nAnd finally, we introduced a compensation-based diversity metric and earned a perfect score on the Corporate Equality Index for the 6th consecutive year. I'm proud to lead a team that can deliver on financial, operational, environmental, customer and diversity goals simultaneously.\nLooking ahead, we're well positioned for sustainable organic growth over the next decade, including affordable renewable additions in our proposed Minnesota and Colorado resource plans. The transmission needed to enable those carbon-free resources and responsible transitions as we retire our coal plants. Together, our resource plans will add nearly 10,000 megawatts of renewables to our system and achieve an 85% carbon reduction by 2030. In December, we reached a settlement in our Colorado resource plan that will accelerate the retirement of our Comanche 3 coal unit to 2034 in advance our Pony plant conversion to natural gas to 2026, while maintaining plans to add approximately 4,000 megawatts of renewables and reduced carbon 87% by 2030.\nWe also reached a settlement in our $1.7 billion pathway transmission project in Colorado. The pathway will provide 560 miles of double-circuit 345 kV lines to enable 5,500 megawatts of new renewables in the state. The settlement includes a certificate of need, rider recovery and a potential for a 90-mile line extension with an additional investment of $250 million to enable access to some of the richest wind resources in the region. We expect decisions on both the Minnesota and the Colorado resource plans and the pathway transmission project in the first quarter of the year.\nAs we've previously discussed, our capital investment plan is not dependent on changes in federal policy. However, the energy provisions that were included in the build better legislation would provide substantial customer benefits and help enable the clean energy transition. While that legislation has stalled, there is some discussion that a more modest version could potentially move forward this year. This could include new and extended tax credits for wind, solar, hydrogen, storage, nuclear and transmission along with a direct pay option for the tax credits. Continue to advocate for these provisions, which will be beneficial for our customers and as President, Biden has suggested there may be congressional support for energy and climate bill with a more modest price tag than the original build-back better bill.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Brian.\n\nBrian J. Van Abel\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Xcel Energy Inc.\n\nThanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. We had another strong year, booking $2.96 per share for 2021 compared with $2.79 per share in 2020. The most significant earnings drivers for the year include the following: higher electric and natural gas margins increased earnings by $0.41 per share, primarily driven by risers and regulatory outcomes to recover our capital investments. In addition, a lower effective tax rate increased earnings by $0.17 per share. Production tax credits lowered the ETR, however, PTCs are flowed back to customers through lower electric margin and are largely earnings neutral. Offsetting these positive drivers were increased depreciation expense, which reduced earnings by $0.24 per share, reflecting our capital investment program.\nLower APDC decreased earnings by $0.10 per share, largely due to placing several large wind farms into service last year. Higher other taxes, primarily property taxes decreased earnings by $0.03 per share and other items combined to reduce earnings by $0.04 per share.\nTurning to sales. Weather-adjusted electric sales increased by 1.7% in 2021 as the economy recovered from the pandemic. We anticipate weather-adjusted sales growth of approximately 1% in 2022. Shifting to expenses. Our O&M spend was flat in 2020 -- 2021. This continues an existing trend as we kept our O&M flat since 2014, while adding significant renewables and capital investment. We expect O&M will increase 1% to 2% in 2022, driven by wind farm additions, increased spending on electric vehicle programs and other customer initiatives.\nTurning to regulatory. We reached an unopposed settlement in our Colorado electric case, which will provide a net rate increase of $177 million based on an ROE of 9.3%, an equity ratio of 55.7% in the 2021 test year. Every settlement is based on compromises, and we feel this is a constructive outcome for all parties. Hearings were completed last week, and we expect the commission decision in March.\nWe also reached a black box settlement principle in our Texas Electric case, which provides a rate increase of approximately $89 million. The agreement also accelerates the depreciation life of the coal plant to 2034. The commission decision is anticipated later this year.\nMoving to Minnesota. In December, the commission approved interim rates of $247 million for electric customers and $25 million for natural gas customers. The commission granted interim rates as requested for our natural gas operations but lowered our electrical request by $41 million due to the lingering impacts of the pandemic on residential customers. They made similar adjustments for CenterPoint and Minnesota Power. The schedules for both cases are included in the earnings release, and we expect commission decisions in mid-2023. Earlier this week, we filed a natural gas case in Colorado, seeking a net rate increase of $107 million in 2022 with incremental step increases of $40 million in 2023 and $41 million in 2024. The request was driven by significant capital investments for customer growth, safety, reliability and resiliency and is based on a 10.25% ROE, an equity ratio of 55.6%, in the 2022 current [test] year.\nOur average Colorado residential customers' natural gas bill was 24% below the national average in 2020, among the lowest in the country. We anticipate a commission decision later this year and final rates to be implemented in November 2022. Shifting to earnings. We've updated our 2022 guidance assumptions largely to reflect 2021 actual results. Details are included in our earnings release. In addition, we are reaffirming our 2022 earnings guidance range of $3.10 to $3.20 per share, which is consistent with our long-term 5% to 7% EPS growth objective.\nWith that, I'll wrap up with a quick summary. We delivered 2021 earnings guidance within our guidance range, the 17th consecutive year and increased our dividend for the 18th consecutive year. We continue to execute on our steel-for-fuel strategy by adding 800-megawatt wind (inaudible) system. We remain on track to achieve 80% carbon reduction by 2030 and plan to be coal-free by 2034.\nWe reached constructive rate case settlements in Colorado, Texas, New Mexico, Wisconsin, North Dakota and Michigan. We also reached constructive settlements and several additional regulatory proceedings in Colorado, including storm Yuri cost recovery, our resource plan and the pathway transmission project. We've kept our O&M expenses flat since 2014. We reaffirmed our 2022 earnings guidance, and we remain confident we can deliver long-term earnings and dividend growth in the upper half of our 5% to 7% objective range to continue leading the clean energy transition and keeping this well for our customers.\nThis concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now take questions."

Earnings Call\n\nXELNASDAQAPR 27, 4:00 PM\n\nOperator\n\nHello, and welcome to the Xcel Energy First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. My name is George, and I'll be a coordinator for today's event. Please note, this conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]\nI'll now hand it over to Mr. Paul Johnson, Vice President, Treasurer, and Investor Relations, to begin this conference. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nPaul Andrew Johnson\n\nVP & IR, Xcel Energy Inc.\n\nThank you. Good morning, and welcome to Xcel Energy's 2023 First Quarter Earnings Call. Joining me today are Bob Frenzel, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Van Abel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In addition, we have other members of the management team in the room to answer your questions if needed. This morning, we will review our '23 first quarter results and highlights and share recent business developments. Slides that accompany today's call are available on our website.\nAs a reminder, some of the comments made during today's call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our SEC filings. Today, we will discuss certain metrics that are non-GAAP measures. Information on the comparable GAAP measures and reconciliations are included in our earnings release.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Bob.\n\nRobert C. Frenzel\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Xcel Energy, Inc.\n\nThanks, Paul, and good morning, everyone. Let's start with our first quarter results. We had another solid financial quarter, recording earnings of $0.76 per share for 2023 compared to $0.70 per share in 2022. The increase in earnings largely reflects new revenue to recover our investments in clean energy and grid systems for the benefit of our customers. Our business plan is on track for the year, and as a result, we are reaffirming our 2023 earnings guidance of $3.30 to $3.40 per share. This quarter, we continue to make progress on our industry-leading clean energy transition plans. We've received and reviewed a significant number of proposals in our pending solicitations for nearly 6,000 megawatts of new electric generation across multiple jurisdictions.\nWe anticipate commission decisions on these various proceedings in the second half of '23 and remain confident in our ability to deliver a beneficial mix of both company-owned and third-party resources across those plans. We also continue to pursue the benefits and opportunities provided by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the Inflation Reduction Act to accelerate the clean energy transition. We recently submitted multiple projects to the Department of Energy for funding consideration, including the multiparty Heartland and Western Interstate Hydrogen Hub and grid resilience investments in Colorado.\nIn addition, we recently applied for DOE and venture capital grants for our long-duration energy storage proposals in Colorado and Minnesota and believe we are well-positioned to receive some or all of our requests. Our country and our company need new technologies, like long-duration storage, like hydrogen and clean fuels to commercialize in order to realize a clean energy future. And at Xcel Energy, we are actively working to do our part for the regions and the customers that we serve. And while the promise of a clean energy future is bright, we are keenly aware of the financial challenges that some of our customers experienced this winter with a significant rise in gas prices that we saw in 2022, driven by macroeconomic and geopolitical issues.\nXcel Energy is proud of our long track record of keeping customer bills amongst the lowest in the country and to transition to a cleaner energy future with bill increases below the rate of inflation. We believe that affordability, reliability and sustainability can be realized concurrently through thoughtful energy policy and excellent operations. We've taken a number of steps in recent years that have saved customers' money and reduced exposure to commodity volatility. In our electric business, Xcel Energy's nearly 4,500 megawatts of owned wind farms continue to be a leader in capacity factor performance and generated $1.1 billion of fuel-related customer benefits in 2022 and more than $3 billion since 2017.\nFuture investments in renewable generation and clean fuels will continue to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and add further benefits to our customers. Since 2014, we've kept our operating and maintenance expenses nearly flat and well below inflation through our continuous improvement programs, which is a benefit that accrues to our customers' bills. Our numerous energy efficiency and demand management programs have saved enough energy to avoid building approximately 25 average-sized power plants. And in 2022, we disbursed a record $216 million in state and federal payment assistance funds to customers across our states, and we expect to exceed that record in 2023.\nAlso, in partnership with Colorado Staff, Colorado Energy Office, Energy Outreach Colorado and the Utility Consumer Advocate, we proposed to the commission to increase funding to support income-qualified customers burdened by high energy costs. We expect to provide those increased benefits to our customers throughout 2023 and beyond. And with recent declines in natural gas prices, we proactively lowered our gas recovery mechanism in Colorado 4x, reducing customers' gas costs by 58%. Our customers in our other states are seeing comparable benefits. In Colorado, we've been working with stakeholders on proposed legislation regarding customer affordability, rate stability and the regulatory process. And finally, in addition to our energy efficiency programs, we are relooking at potential long-term solutions to reduce price volatility that could include physical and financial hedging, additional natural gas storage, long-term natural gas supply contracts, multiyear rate plans, natural gas cost deferrals, energy decoupling and the use of renewable energy to generate clean fuels for blending in the natural gas LDC.\nWe are confident that if implemented, these actions can help reduce natural gas volatility in the future for our customers. As I wrap up, I'm pleased to share some of the company's recent recognition. For the tenth year in a row, we've been honored as one of the world's most admired companies by Fortune Magazine. We ranked first in social responsibility and quality of management, placing second overall amongst the most admired electric and gas companies in the country. In addition, for the fourth year in a row, Xcel Energy has been named one of the world's most ethical companies by Ethisphere, a global leader in defining and advancing the standards of ethical business practices.\nNone of this will be possible without the commitment of our employees, contractors and our partners. And while we're proud of our track record and our accolades, we will never rest on our mission to provide our customers with safe, clean, reliable energy services at a competitive price.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Brian.\n\nBrian J. Van Abel\n\nTreasurer & Vice President, Xcel Energy, Inc.\n\nThanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. We had another solid quarter, reporting earnings of $0.76 per share for the first quarter of 2023 compared with $0.70 per share in 2022. The most significant earnings drivers for the quarter included the following: higher electric and natural gas revenues increased earnings by $0.24 per share, reflecting new revenue to recover investments in our electric and natural gas systems and clean energy infrastructure. A lower effective tax rate increased earnings by $0.02 per share. But keep in mind, production tax credits lowered the ETR.\nHowever, PTCs are flowed back to customers through lower electric margin and are largely earnings-neutral. In addition, other items combined to increase earnings by $0.01 per share. Offsetting these positive drivers were increased depreciation expense, which reduced earnings by $0.08 per share, reflecting our capital investment program, higher O&M expense, which decreased earnings by $0.06 per share and higher interest expense and other taxes which decreased earnings by $0.07 per share. Turning to sales. Weather-adjusted electric sales increased by 0.6% for the first 3 months of 2023. We continue to expect annual electric sales growth of approximately 1% in 2023, driven by C&I sales, while we expect residential sales to be down slightly for the year.\nO&M expenses increased $48 million for the first quarter. The increase was primarily due to timing differences associated with regulatory recovery mechanisms, generation outages and emergent work, inflationary pressures and investments in electric vehicle programs and other customer products. We continue to expect O&M to decrease approximately 2% in 2023 compared with last year. We've also made progress on a number of regulatory proceedings. The commission recently approved our settlement in the Minnesota natural gas rate case, which reflects a rate increase of $21 million, an ROE of 9.57%, an equity ratio of 52.5% in the decoupling mechanism and property tax tracker.\nIn the Minnesota electric case, we received a constructive ALJ recommendation including a 9.87% ROE and a 52.5% equity ratio. We anticipate a commission decision in June and final rates implemented in the fall. During the quarter, we filed a Texas electric rate case seeking a rate increase of $158 million based on an ROE of 10.65%, an equity ratio of 54.6% in the historic test year in the early retirement of the Tolk coal plant. We anticipate a commission decision and implementation of final rates in the first quarter of 2024. Our electric rate case in Colorado is early in the process.\nIntervenor recommendations are due in May, and we'll see if there's a potential to reach a settlement with parties. A commission decision and implementation of final rates are expected in the fall. In our New Mexico electric rate case, intervenors filed an initial testimony. The staff recommended a forward test year with a rate increase of $37 million based on an ROE of 9.35% and an equity ratio of 54.7%. Other intervenors recommended equity ratios in the range of 45% to 54.7% and ROEs between 8.7% to 9.6%. We anticipate a decision later in the year.\nFinally, later this month, we'll file a rate case in Wisconsin, seeking an electric rate increase of approximately $40 million and a natural gas rate increase of approximately $9 million based on a 10.25% ROE, a 52.5% equity ratio and a 2024 future test year. We expect the commission to decide on the case before year-end with new rates in effect in January. Details on these cases are included in our earnings release. We are reaffirming our 2023 earnings guidance range of $3.30 to $3.40 per share, which is consistent with our long-term EPS growth objective of 5% to 7%. We've updated our key assumptions to reflect the latest information, which are detailed in our earnings release.\nWith that, I'll wrap up with a quick summary. Our customers continue to have some of the lowest bills in the country, we remain committed to keeping long-term bill growth below the rate of inflation while leading the clean energy transition and reducing customer exposure to volatility in fossil fuel prices. We continue to achieve constructive regulatory outcomes across our operating companies with progress across multiple rate cases. We have received a significant number of generation bids in response to our RFPs with additional RFPs forthcoming. We are reaffirming our 2023 earnings guidance, and we remain confident, we continue to deliver long-term earnings and dividend growth within the upper half of our 5% to 7% objective range as we lead the clean energy transition.\nThis concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now take questions."

Slides accompany today's call are available on our website. Please note that we've changed our presentation. As a result, we no longer refer to electric and natural gas margin. Instead, we'll discuss changes in revenue and cost of goods sold from the income statement.\nPlease note that these [ multi ] fluctuations in cost of electric fuel and natural gas are recovered through regulatory mechanisms and are generally earnings neutral. As a reminder, some of the comments during today's call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and SEC filings. Today, we'll discuss certain measures that are non-GAAP measures.

Frenzel\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Xcel Energy, Inc.\n\nThank you, Paul, and good morning, and welcome, everyone. It's been 2 months since wildfires impacted our Texas neighbors and before Brian walks through our financial results, I'd like to discuss the actions we're taking to protect the public and to strengthen our systems resiliency in the states that we serve.\nIn February, multiple wildfires were ignited in Texas. And from the outset of those fires, our focus has been on the people, in the communities, and the [ panhandle ] and on the safety and the well-being of our coworkers and their families there. I want to thank all of the first responders, emergency personnel, state and local employees and our own SPS employees who work tirelessly in support of our customers and our communities during and after the event.\nThey provide wildfire response, community assistance, relief services and work tirelessly in the field to restore essential services. [ Be to the panhandle ] and I've witnessed the impacted areas and I can see for the entire Xcel Energy team when I say that we are saddened by the losses, and we will stand with the Panhandle community as we recover, rebuild and renew that area as we have for over 100 years.\nXcel Energy has acknowledged that our distribution poles appear to have been involved in an addition of the Smoke House Creek fire and smaller [ remerfire ], which quickly burned into the smoke fire footprint. We assume claims that Xcel Energy acted negligently in maintaining an operating infrastructure. In addition, we do not believe that our facilities caused the [ way to dose or the Grapevine ] Creek fires and believe that their additions are caused by distribution lines owned by other companies.\nIn an effort to expedite relief and recovery in the community, we've established a claims processes for those who have property or livestock was in the Smokehouse Creek fires, and are actively settling a number of claims. So far, 46 claims have been submitted. And as on April 22, Xcel Energy and SPS have been named as defendants on 15 lawsuits.\nBased on the most current information, we believe it's probable that we incur a loss due to the Smokehouse Creek wildfire and accrued a liability of $215 million which is offset by an insurance receivable since it's lower than our approximately $500 million insurance.\nPlease note that the $215 million loss equivalent preliminary estimate, which reflects the low end of our range and is subject to change based on new information. More information on Smokehouse Creek, please see our disclosures in our earnings release and our Form 10-Q.\nOn all [ utilities ] who are experiencing profound changes in weather and climate related impacts on our operations. As a result, we must continue to evolve our operations for these unparalleled dynamics. Risk mitigation and system resiliency has long been a priority for Xcel Energy and continue into the future.\nOur strategy consists of 3 phases: first immediate near-term response; second, regulatory activities needed to address comprehensive wildfire mitigation and resiliency plans; third, additional state and federal legislation that could be valuable.\nPart of our first phase, we've accelerated risk-reduction initiatives across our system, including accelerating [ portfolio ] inspections and replacements as well as operational actions such as proactive deenergizing the lines and adjusting reclosure settings, known as power saving, power shells and enhanced power line safety setting.\nWe've been operating under approved wildfire plant in Colorado since 2020. As part of our second phase strategy, we will file updated wildfire mitigation plans in our respective states beginning with an updated Colorado WMP later this quarter. The plans incorporate industry learnings that are tailored to our unique geographies and risk profiles.\nNewly expanded actions include increased vegetation management, accelerating pole inspections, hardening and replacements, distribution undergrounding segmentation and covered conductor programs, transition line hardening and ore rebuilds, enhanced enclosure settings and correctively energizing of lines and situational [ alliance ] programs, including weather stations, cameras and other monitoring software.\nLater this year, we intend to file a system resiliency plan that will include wildfire mitigation and SPS contemplated under recent Texas law. And the third component of our strategy is to continue to step up our efforts to innovate and plan for evolving climate wildfire risk.\nWe know that our ability to enable a clean energy transition and to deliver important products to our customers is predicated on maintaining a reasonable cost of capital, and we believe that proactive legislation in a state and federal level is a potential vehicle to ensure that our customers continue to receive affordable, reliable, sustainable and safe power service.\nWe are doing this alone. We're working across the industry with peer utilities, industry groups such as EEI and [ EPRI], partner of Energy, federal, state, global agencies, first responders, our labor partners and countless others. While we need to reduce wildfire risk our core operations remain strong and our investment opportunities robust.\nDuring the first quarter, we made significant progress on our clean energy transition and resource plans. In February, we filed our resource plan for the NSP system, we proposed to add 6,400 megawatts of new resources and extend the lives of our Prairie Island and [ Monticello ] nuclear facilities past 2050.\nThe proposed plan reduces carbon emissions by more than 80% while increasing customer bills by approximately 1% annually. We anticipate a decision on our proposal by the Minister of Commission in 2025. In New Mexico, the commission accepted our resource plan and proposed approximately 5,000 to 10,000 megawatts of new generation by 2030.\nWe anticipate issuing an RFP for the resource needs this summer. And finally, the Minnesota Commission recently approved our updated transportation electrification plan and we filed an updated transportation electrification plan in New Mexico in April. We also made continued progress with several economic and commercial development projects.\nIn February, we announced the working with Microsoft to bring a new data center to our retiring Sherco coal facility. The proposed data center is positioned to be 1 of our largest customers in Minnesota and is projected to bring jobs and investments to the community.\nIn March, Meta broke ground on its previously announced data center that will be powered by NSP Minnesota. Meta will provide funding for new infrastructure upgrades, including transmission lines to support the project, and the facility is slated to open in late summer 2025. Accelerating proactively worked with data center developers, communities and stakeholders across our states to ensure that we can reliably and affordably serve this new demand while providing benefits to our other customers.\nWith several additional opportunities in the pipeline, we expect data centers to drive further growth for the foreseeable future. Our employees are at the heart of these many accomplishments. Our team is composed of dedicated and hard-working and courageous employees are committed to serving our communities with same clean, reliable and affordable energy.\nFor the 11th year in a row, Xcel Energy was honored as one of the world's most admired companies by Fortune Magazine, placing 2nd overall among the most admired gas electric company [indiscernible] country. For the fifth in row, Xcel Energy has been one of the world's most ethical companies by Ethisphere. Xcel is 1 of only 5 energy companies in the United States recognized this year. Xcel Energy also joined the Economic Opportunity Coalition, a public-private partnership with the U.S. government, where we committed to allocating 15% of our U.S.-based contract spending in the areas of energy supply, distribution, transition and clean energy small and underserved businesses by 2025.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Brian.\n\nBrian J. Van Abel\n\nTreasurer & Vice President, Xcel Energy, Inc.\n\nThanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. Turning to our financial results. Excel Energy had earnings of $0.88 per share for the first quarter of 2024 compared to $0.76 per share in 2023. The increase in earnings reflects our investment of approximately $8 billion over the last 5 quarters to improve resiliency and enable clean energy for our customers while delivering economic growth and vitality for our communities.\nThe most significant earnings drivers for the quarter included the following: the impact of electric and natural gas rate reviews to recover our capital investments increased earnings by $0.12 per share. Lower O&M expenses increased earnings by $0.06 per share, reflecting lower labor and benefit costs, lower bad debt expenses and gains from a land sale for a data center.\nNon-[indiscernible] recover capital investment increased earnings by $0.05. Offsetting these positive drivers were higher depreciation and amortization decreased earnings by $0.05 per share, reflecting our capital investment programs. Higher interest charges decreased earnings by $0.05 per share. In addition, other items combined to decrease earnings by $0.01 per share.\n[indiscernible] sales, year-to-date weather and leap year adjusted electric sales decreased by 0.3% and natural gas sales increased by 1.7% as compared to 2023. Please note that we have revised our projected electric sales growth to 1% to 2% for the year, largely due to declining use per customer and timing delays for expansions for some of our large C&I customers. However, we can certainly expect long-term electric sales to grow 3% annually.\nDuring the quarter, we also made progress on a relatively light rate [indiscernible]. In April, the Texas Commission approved our electric [indiscernible] settlement without modification. The settlement reflects a rate increase of $65 million based on the black box settlement which includes an ROE of 9.55% and an equity ratio of 54.5% for [ AADC ] process.\nIn our Minnesota Natural Gas [ rate case ], we received interviewer customary last week. [ Periods ] were scheduled for [ dry ] and expect the commission decision by year-end or in the first quarter of next year. And in our Colorado natural gas rate case, procedural schedule has been established that reflects interviewer testimony in July, hearings in September and a commission decision in the fourth quarter.\nPlease see our earnings release for more details on our regulatory proceedings. We are reaffirming our 2024 earnings guidance range of $3.50 and to $3.60 per share, which is consistent with our long-term EPS growth objective of 5% to 7%. In addition, we've updated our key assumptions to reflect the latest information, which are detailed in our earnings release.\nWith that, I'll wrap up with a [indiscernible] summary. We are proactively enhancing our operational and wildfire mitigation actions, commanded the risk to our systems to protect our customers from extreme weather. We continue to expect to deliver 2024 earnings within our guidance range as of half of the past 19 years.\nWe are executing on our capital investment plan, including clean generation transmission and distribution to support reliability and resiliency and economic development to support our communities. And we remain confident we can deliver long-term earnings growth at or above the top end of our 5% to 7% range starting in 2025 and dividend growth at the low end of our 7% objective range.\nThis concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now take questions."

Joining me today are Bob Frenzel, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Van Abel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In addition, we have other members of the management team in the room to answer questions if needed. This morning, we will review our 2024 Second quarter results and highlights and share recent business developments. Slides that accompany today's call are available on our website.\nAs a reminder, some comments made during today's call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and SEC filings. Today, we'll also discuss certain metrics that are non-GAAP measures. Information on comparable GAAP measures and reconciliations are included in our earnings release.\nWith that, I'll now turn the call over to Bob.\n\nRobert C. Frenzel\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Xcel Energy, Inc.\n\nThank you, Paul, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that the company delivered another quarter of solid operational and financial progress. Our long-term business model remains robust. We continue to deploy capital for the benefit of our customers and communities. We enable a future powered by cleaner fuels and a more resilient and intelligent grid. We partner with stakeholders to encourage economic development, we provide products and services capable of meeting our customers' most important needs.\nIn the most recent quarter, we invested $1.7 billion in resilient and reliable energy infrastructure. We delivered earnings per share of $0.54 for our owners. We provided industry-leading storm response and strong customer reliability despite challenging weather conditions for our customers. We accelerated our wildfire risk reduction measures to enable safer and more resilient communities.\nXcel Energy's commitment to our communities and investors is anchored by our core investment thesis as an integrated pure-play utility and a clean energy leader. For more than two decades, we've been a leading provider of wind energy to our customers, and we were the first U.S. energy company to commit to a carbon-free electric future. We delivered our earnings guidance for 19 straight years, one of the best records in our industry, and we look to make it 20 this year. We have a long-term and transparent growth plan, making investments in clean generation new to and enhanced energy grids and economic development programs to support our communities vitality.\nIn 2020, our continuous improvement programs have saved $400 million in recurring O&M expense, while improving operating outcomes and reducing enterprise risk. Our steel for fuel strategy delivered more than $4 billion in customer fuel-related savings since 2017. This discipline alongside support of state and federal policies enables us to reduce emissions and keep residential electric and natural gas bills 28% and 14% below the industry average and growth well below the rate of inflation. With our 11,000-plus employees commitment to serving customers, we're $0.14 ahead of 2023 year-to-date earnings, and as a result, we are reaffirming our 2024 earnings guidance.\nDuring the quarter, we continued our progress on our clean energy transition through multiple resource planning and RFP processes. We issued an RFP for 1,600 megawatts of wind, solar, storage and hybrid resources in the upper Midwest. [ These are due ] in September, we expect commission decisions in 2025. We now have active RFPs for over 4,000 megawatts of resources in the upper middle [ Midwest ]. In Mexico and Texas, commissions approved 418 megawatts of company-owned solar generation that's expected to be in service between 2026 and 2027. And last week, we issued an RFP and SPS seeking 3,100 megawatts of accredited capacity which could ultimately yield more than 5,000 megawatts of renewables and firm dispatchable generation. Bids are due in January of '25, and we expect commission approval in 2026.\nLast quarter, I discussed a number of initiatives that Xcel Energy is taking to reduce wildfire risk. I'm incredibly proud of what our team has been able to accomplish in a short amount of time. Since March, we've developed the capability to deliver enhanced daily wildfire safety operations across the enterprise as well as the ability to conduct proactive public safety power shutoff as evidenced by recent events in Colorado, Texas and New Mexico during threatening conditions. We've accelerated pole inspections, including replacing Priority 1 and Priority 2 poles across our system. We're expanding visual coverage with our Pano AI-enabled camera system to over 50,000 square miles in Colorado, enabling first responders access to critical information, including precision triangulation and fire locations. And we've accelerated deployment of Technosylva's risk modeling system and expect it to have it operational enterprise-wide by the end of the year.\nWe recently filed an updated Colorado wildfire mitigation plan that integrates industry experience incorporates evolving risk assessment methodologies, adds new technology and expands the scope, pace and scale of our programs to reduce wildfire risk. The plan has four primary programs that include enhanced situational awareness, the improved meteorology, area risk mapping and modeling, artificial intelligence cameras and continuous monitoring. Operational mitigations that include enhanced power line safety settings and public safety, power shutoff capabilities, system resiliency through increased asset assessment and remediation, Pole replacements, line rebuilds, targeted undergrounding and vegetation management and improved coordination, technology and real-time data sharing with customers and other stakeholders as well as PSPS resiliency rebates. We expect to file resiliency plans with SPS that will include wildfire mitigation later this year and are developing former wildfire mitigation plans for the rest of our states. Finally, we're working with stakeholders at both the state and federal level on legislation to enhance the safety of our communities from evolving weather risks while protecting the financial integrity of companies that provide these essential services.\nMoving to economic development. We're seeing a material shift in long-term electric demand on our system after several years of relatively flat sales growth. Our current 5-year electric sales forecast assumes approximately 3% annual growth. Nearly half of that growth is driven by electrification of oil and natural gas production, electric vehicle adoption, and beneficial electrification, economic growth and increasing customer counts. The remainder of that growth is driven by contracted and high-probability data center load, including previously announced deals of Meta and Microsoft in Minnesota and QTS in Colorado as well as others. We believe this forecast is now conservative given a pipeline of data center requests totaling 6,700 megawatts by 2030. If all of the data center requests came to fruition, our data center sales CAGR would be over 9%. We continue working through the request and plan on updating our sales and capital investment forecast on the third quarter call.\nXcel Energy is strategically positioned to secure economic data center load with high-quality partners due to our access to low-cost renewable generation, the availability of water and fiber infrastructure, unencumbered land and our speed to market. At the same time, we'll continue to focus on the impacts to all customers, ensuring we have both economic contracts and system resources to provide safe, clean and reliable power to our communities.\nDuring the quarter, there were two regulatory outcomes that provide for cleaner and more resilient electric and natural gas distribution system, First, Colorado passed a bill that enables qualified electric utilities to make necessary distribution investments with timely recover to achieve state policy goals, including transportation and building electrification and enabling distributed energy resources. This was the result of extensive stakeholder process supported by the Colorado Energy office, our IBW labor partners, environmental advocates, NRDC and WRA as well as the Colorado Solar and Storage Association and others.\nSecond, the Colorado Commission approved the modified clean heat plant, which establishes a starting point for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from our natural gas distribution system. Full year budget of up to $441 million was approved, which sets funding primarily for beneficial electrification and natural gas efficiency. We look forward to working with the stakeholders and regulators to implement these initiatives to meet our long-term sustainability goals in Colorado.\nFinally, we recently released our 19th sustainability report. We're proud of our history at Xcel Energy. And as we look forward, we're committed to delivering the essential energy services our customers value and need while driving positive change that supports the environment and communities. I'm deeply appreciative and thankful for the commitment and hard work of our employees and partners to deliver a clean energy future. We remain relentless in our pursuit of our vision and will continue to deliver long-term value to our shareholders an affordable, reliable and sustainable energy for the communities in which we live and work. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian.\n\nBrian J. Van Abel\n\nTreasurer & Vice President, Xcel Energy, Inc.\n\nThanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. Starting with our financial results. Xcel Energy had earnings of $0.54 per share for the second quarter of 2024 compared to $0.52 per share in 2023. The most significant earnings drivers for the quarter included the following: revenues from electric rate cases and riders to recover capital investments combined to increase earnings by $0.26 per share. Higher AFUDC increased earnings by $0.04 per share, and revenues from natural gas rate cases increased earnings by $0.02 per share. Offsetting these positive drivers were higher depreciation and amortization decreased earnings by $0.18 per share, reflecting our capital investment programs. Higher interest charges decreased earnings by $0.07 per share. Higher O&M expenses decreased earnings by $0.04 per share and other factors combined to reduce earnings by $0.01 per share.\nTurning to our sales discussion. Year-to-date weather and leap year adjusted electric sales decreased by 0.4% and natural gas sales increased by 0.4%. We're updating our 2024 forecast to reflect a 1% increase for electric sales with expected increases in C&I load in the second half of the year. Longer term, we continue to see robust demand in our C&I sector, driven by data center loads in Minnesota and Colorado, along with oil and natural gas electrification and SPS.\nDuring the quarter, we continued to make progress on a relatively light rate case calendar. In June, we reached an uncontested settlement in our Minnesota natural gas case, providing a $46 million rate increase based on a 9.6% ROE and a 52.5% equity ratio. The final commission decision is expected by year-end. In our Colorado natural gas rate case, we received intervener testimony in July. There's a settlement deadline at the end of August with hearing scheduled for September. We expect a commission decision in the fourth quarter. And in July, the Texas Commission approved our $13 million distribution rider request. This represents our first distribution rider requests in Texas, and we expect it will allow us to reduce the frequency of future rate cases.\nWe also continue to make progress on the claims process for the Smokehouse Creek wildfire. We've received 141 claims, of which 43 have been settled, which we view as a positive and constructive outcome. 21 lawsuits have also been filed. In addition, there is no change to our estimate of our accrued liability of $215 million. As a reminder, we have approximately $500 million of excess liability insurance coverage for the fire.\nFinally, we are reaffirming our 2024 earnings guidance range of $3.50 to $3.60 per share, which is consistent with our long-term EPS growth objective of 5% to 7%. In addition, we've updated key assumptions to reflect the latest information, which are detailed in our earnings release.\nWith that, I'll wrap up with a quick summary. We continue to expect to deliver 2024 earnings within our guidance range as we have for the past 19 years. We're executing on our capital investment plan, including clean generation, transmission and distribution to support reliability and resiliency economic development to support our communities. We're proactively enhancing our wildfire mitigation actions to manage the risk to our systems and to protect our customers from extreme weather. We remain confident we can deliver long-term earnings growth at or above the top end of our 5% to 7% range starting in 2025.\nThis concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we'll now take questions."

Today's conference is being recorded. After the presentation, we will open up for questions. Questions will only be taken from institutional investors. Reporters can contact Media Relations with inquiries, and individual investors and others can reach out to Investor Relations. I will now hand the call over to Paul Johnson, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nPaul Andrew Johnson\n\nVP of IR & Treasurer, Xcel Energy Inc.\n\nGood morning, and welcome to Xcel Energy's 2022 Third Quarter Earnings Call. Joining me today are Bob Frenzel, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Van Abel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In addition, we have others in the room available to answer questions if needed. This morning, we will discuss our 2022 results, share recent business and regulatory developments, update our capital and financing plans and provide 2023 guidance. Slides that accompany today's call are available on our website.\nAs a reminder, some of the comments made during today's call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our SEC filings. Today, we will discuss certain measures that are non-GAAP metrics. Information on the comparable GAAP measures and reconciliations are included in our earnings release. I'll now turn the call over to Bob.\n\nRobert C. Frenzel\n\nPresident, CEO & Chairman, Xcel Energy Inc.\n\nThanks, Paul, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter earnings call. Let's start with our financial results. We had another solid quarter, recording earnings of $1.18 per share for 2022 compared to $1.13 per share in 2021. Our earnings are on track, and as a result, we are narrowing our '22 earnings guidance range to $3.14 to $3.19 per share. We're also initiating 2023 earnings guidance of $3.30 to $3.40 per share, which reflects our 5% to 7% long-term EPS growth objective. Consistent with past practices, we've updated our base investment plan, which reflects $29.5 billion of capital expenditures over the next 5 years. This investment plan provides significant benefits to our customers, supports community vitality and resiliency and delivers rate base growth of 6.5%.\nWe're very excited about our investment plans, which support continued execution of our long-term strategy and clean energy leadership. It enhances reliability and resiliency, advances our generation fleet transition, allows for the electrification of transportation, keeps customers' bills low and delivers attractive returns for investors. And while our base plan is robust, it does not include any potential renewable generation assets that are approved in our Minnesota and Colorado resource plans, or additional transmission capital that's needed to integrate new renewable generation in Colorado beyond the Power Pathway Project.\nFor these assets, we expect further regulatory clarification in the second half of 2023, which could result in incremental capital expenditures of $2 billion to $4 billion, which would result in rate base growth of 7.6% at the midpoint. Our updated capital plan, which reflects the benefits of the IRA, extends the growth rate and improves the quality of rate base, reduces financing risk, improves credit metrics, and deliver substantial customer and environmental benefits.\nDuring the quarter, the Inflation Reduction Act was passed into law, which includes new and extended tax credits for wind, solar, hydrogen, storage, carbon sequestration and nuclear. It also includes tax credit transferability. Some of the key takeaways for the IRA include substantial customer benefits and a continuation of our clean energy leadership while keeping customer bills affordable. The inclusion of the new solar production tax credit makes our company-owned projects more affordable for our customers relative to the solar ITC. The hydrogen production tax credit should improve our competitive advantage in delivering low-cost, clean fuels for our combustion turbines for electric reliability and for blending into our local gas distribution systems that will help our customers lower their carbon footprint in the future.\nThe nuclear production tax credit will provide additional customer credits depending on MISO marginal pricing thereby lowering the cost of electricity from our existing nuclear assets. The tax credit transferability will increase liquidity and improve credit metrics. An excellent example of the IRA tax benefits is our 460-megawatt Sherco Solar proposal that was recently approved by the Minnesota Commission with strong stakeholder support. This will be the largest solar facility in the Midwest and a top 5 installation in the United States, which will go into service in 2024 and 2025.\nFollowing the IRA passage, the levelized cost of Sherco Solar is projected to decline by over 30%, even after accounting for inflation and supply chain pressures due to the project qualified for both solar PTCs and community energy bonus as we are reinvesting in the community around our retiring coal facility. This is a substantial benefit to our customers. Earlier this year, the commissions in both Minnesota and Colorado approved resource plans that will add nearly 10,000 megawatts of utility scale renewables to our systems and achieve an 85% carbon reduction by 2030. These resource plans were approved prior to the passage of the IRA, but the final recommended portfolios are expected to capture the benefits of the IRA which will significantly reduce the levelized cost of these renewable projects for our customers.\nWe've issued a request for proposal in Minnesota and plan to issue an RFP in Colorado later this year. After evaluation of proposals, we anticipate submitting our recommended portfolios to our respective commissions by the middle of next year and expect decisions in the second half of next year. We expect the recommended portfolios of generation assets will include a mixture of self-build, build-own-transfer projects as well as some power purchase agreements. Our generation of resource plans are consistent with our steel-for-fuel strategy, which provides a valuable hedge for our customers against rising commodity prices. As an example, our owned wind farms are projected to generate nearly $1 billion of fuel-related customer savings in 2022 alone and almost $3 billion since 2017. While these fuel savings were not included in our investment case, it shows the tremendous customer benefits of being an early leader in the clean energy transition.\nWe also continue to advance our broader ESG leadership as MSCI recently upgraded Xcel Energy's rating from AA to AAA and categorized our company as leader in their nomenclature for managing the most significant ESG risks and opportunities. It's is an outstanding accomplishment and reflects our continued progress, including adopting a water management goal, greater disclosure of human capital management practices and an improved governance score. We were also named to Investor’s Business Daily 100 Best ESG Companies, which is further recognition of our ESG leadership. And with that, I'll turn it over to Brian.\n\nBrian J. Van Abel\n\nExecutive VP, CFO & Principal Accounting Officer, Xcel Energy Inc.\n\nThanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. We had a solid quarter, recording earnings of $1.18 per share for the third quarter of 2022 compared with $1.13 per share in 2021. The most significant earnings drivers for the quarter included the following: higher electric and natural gas margins increased earnings by $0.33 per share, primarily driven by riders and regulatory outcomes to recover our capital investments. In addition, a lower effective tax rate increased earnings by $0.02 per share. Keep in mind, production tax credits lowered the ETR. However, PTCs are flowed back to customers through lower electric margin and largely earnings neutral. Offsetting these positive drivers were increased depreciation expense, which reduced earnings by $0.10 per share, reflecting our capital investment program, higher O&M expense which decreased earnings by $0.06 per share. Higher interest expense and other taxes, primarily property taxes decreased earnings by $0.07 per share and other items combined to reduce earnings by $0.07 per share.\nTurning to our sales. Our year-to-date weather-adjusted electric sales increased by 2.2%, largely due to higher C&I sales driven by strong economic activity in our service territories. The year-to-date results are relatively consistent with our expectations of 2% sales growth for 2022, while we anticipate more modest sales growth of 1% for next year. Shifting to expense. O&M expenses increased $43 million for the third quarter, driven by investments in technology and customer programs, storm costs, vegetation management and inflation. Like other businesses, we are facing inflationary pressures and now expect an annual O&M increase of approximately 4%. This represents a step increase due to cost pressures. However, we anticipate flat O&M in 2023.\nWe made progress on a number of regulatory proceedings. During the quarter, Minnesota Commission approved our Uri storm settlement, including full recovery of all costs with the exception of a $19 million just launched. We have now resolved year cost recovery in all of our states with the exception of Texas. We also have pending electric and natural gas rate cases in Minnesota. And in a natural gas rate case, we reached a comprehensive settlement which reflects a rate increase of $21 million, an ROE of 9.57%, a currently authorized equity ratio of 52.5%, the decoupling mechanism and property tax tracker.\nWe think this is a constructive settlement and anticipate a commission decision next year. In the Minnesota electric rate case, we recently received intervener testimony. The Department of Commerce recommended a 3-year rate increase of $274 million based on an ROE of 9.25% and an equity ratio of 52.5%. In addition, the Department of Commerce recommendation reflects customer credits for the MISO capacity auction revenues and extension of the depreciable lives of the Monticello nuclear plant and wind farms. We are meeting with parties to see if we can reach a constructive settlement. In October, the Colorado Commission approved a rate increase of $64 million for our natural gas case, reflecting a historic test year with the year-end rate base and $16 million of incremental depreciation expense.\nThe commission also approved a weighted average cost of capital of 6.7%, which will reflect as an ROE of 9.2% and an equity ratio of 53.8% based on the ranges they provided. As a result of the Colorado Commission denying the step increases, we are evaluating options of filing another rate case as the natural gas business remains a critical part of the energy infrastructure in Colorado that is valued by our customers.\nAs far as future filings, we plan to file Colorado and New Mexico electric rate cases later this year in the Texas rate case in the first quarter of 2023. As Bob mentioned, we've issued a robust $29.5 billion 5-year base capital forecast with a rate base growth of 6.5% using 2022 as a base. The base plan reflects significant grid and resiliency investment, our Colorado Power Pathway proposal and other transmission system investments to maintain asset health and reliability and enable renewable generation. The plan reflects a modest level of renewables including our Sherco Solar facility. It also includes natural gas peaking plants to ensure reliability as we retire coal plants, along with investments to improve the customer experience.\nWe also anticipate potential incremental capital investment for renewables associated with the Minnesota and Colorado resource plans. Our proposed resource plans include approximately 3,500 megawatts of additions from 2024 to 2027 which would result in capital investment of $1.5 billion to $3 billion, assuming 50% ownership. In addition, we anticipate the need for an incremental $500 million to $1 billion of related transmission for the Colorado IRP. Combined, we could see a potential incremental investment to support the clean energy transition of $2 billion to $4 billion.\nWe've updated our financing plan, which reflects a combination of cash generation, debt and equity to fund the majority of our capital expenditures. The financing plan assumes $1.8 billion of tax credit transfers which improves our credit metrics, maintains a strong balance sheet and lowers the cost of renewable projects for our customers. Compared to our previous 5-year plan, transfer ability to reduce equity needs to $750 million while we've increased CapEx by $3.5 billion. In addition, we anticipate that any incremental capital will be financed at roughly our current capital structure. It is important to recognize that we've always maintained a conservative financing strategy, which reflects a strong balance sheet and credit metrics, a balanced financing plan and minimal levels of variable debt and longer maturities. This approach is critical in the current market of rising rates and will benefit our customers while maintaining our solid credit ratings and favorable access to the capital markets.\nBob discussed IRA customer benefits, but I wanted to add a few more details. Tax credit transferability is projected to provide $1.8 billion of liquidity, which increases cash flow and reduces our equity needs. Our FFO to debt metrics improved by approximately 100 basis points during the forecast time period, even after adding $3.5 billion of capital and reducing equity needs. The solar PTC and tax credit transferability improved the competitiveness of our renewable bids. We project the IRA will drive approximately $500 million of customer savings from our owned renewable projects over the next 5 years and nuclear PTCs could drive additional savings. We anticipate that pricing will decline on solar projects by 25% to 40% and wind projects by 50% to 60% later in this decade due to new and extended tax credits along with potential adders in the IRA. Finally, we don't anticipate any material impact from AMT as a result of makers depreciation and existing tax credits in our balance sheet.\nShifting to earnings. We've updated our 2022 guidance assumptions to reflect the latest information. We're also narrowing our 2022 earnings guidance range to $3.14 to $3.19 per share. We're also initiating our 2023 earnings guidance range of $3.30 to $3.40 per share, which is consistent with our long-term EPS growth objective of 5% to 7%. Key assumptions are detailed in our earnings release. With that, I'll wrap it up with a quick summary. IRA was passed with significant benefits for our customers in the company. The Minnesota Commission approved our Sherco Solar project. We reached a constructive settlement in our Minnesota natural gas rate case.\nThe Colorado Commission approved our natural gas rate case. We're narrowing our 2022 earnings guidance range. We announced our robust updated capital investment program that provides strong, transparent rate base growth and customer value. We initiated 2023 guidance consistent with our long-term earnings growth rate and we remain confident we can continue to deliver long-term earnings and dividend growth within the upper half of our 5% to 7% objective range as we lead the clean energy transition and keep those low for our customers. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now take questions."

For your information, today's conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions) At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to your host today, Paul Johnson, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nPaul Andrew Johnson\n\nVP of IR & Treasurer, Xcel Energy Inc.\n\nGood morning, and welcome to Xcel Energy's 2022 Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. Joining me today are Bob Frenzel, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Brian Van Abel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In addition, we have other members of the management team in the room to answer questions if needed. This morning, we will review our 2022 results and highlights and share recent business developments and regulatory developments.\nSlides that accompany today's call are available on our website. As a reminder, some of our comments during today's call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our SEC filings. Today, we'll also discuss certain metrics that are non-GAAP measures. Information on the comparable GAAP measures and reconciliations are included in our earnings release. I'll now turn the call over to Bob Frenzel.\n\nRobert C. Frenzel\n\nPresident, CEO & Chairman, Xcel Energy Inc.\n\nThanks, Paul, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter call. We had another very successful year at Xcel Energy, continuing to execute on our strategy while delivering strong financial and operational performance. For our investors, we delivered EPS of $3.17, representing the 18th consecutive year of meeting or exceeding our initial earnings guidance.\nIn February, we raised our annual dividend for the 19th straight year, increasing it $0.12 per share or 6.6%. More recently, in November, we extended our long-term investment plan, which features a 10-year capital outlook with an approximate 7% rate base growth. We ranked in the top quartile and customer reliability or CAIDI and our residential electric builds are more than 20% below the national average.\nAnd amidst the backdrop of significant commodity increases this year, Xcel Energy's 4,500 megawatts of owned wind farms continue to be an industry leader in net capacity factor performance and generated approximately $1 billion of fuel-related customer savings in 2022 and almost $3 billion since 2017. Our nuclear fleet remains the top performing fleet in the country and achieved a capacity factor of 96% last year.\nWe had an active regulatory year and resolved multiple rate cases and Uri storm cost recovery proceedings. The commissions in Minnesota and Colorado approved resource plans that will add nearly 10,000 megawatts of utility-scale renewables to our systems through this decade.\nThe Minnesota Commission approved our 460-megawatt Sherco Solar project. The Colorado Commission approved our $2 billion Power Pathway transmission project and MISO awarded us $1.2 billion of transmission projects, and we accelerated our time line for transitioning out of coal and now expect to be coal-free by the end of 2030, all of which contribute to our leadership in clean energy transition for our customers. We continue to lead in carbon reduction as well.\nIn 2022, our estimated carbon emissions were approximately 52% below 2005 levels, and we remain on track to achieve 80% carbon reduction across the company by 2030. The passage of the Inflation Reduction Act will reduce the cost of renewables for our customers, improves cash flow and credit metrics for the company and enhances the competitiveness of our renewable offerings.\nWe continue to execute on our electric vehicle vision, implementing multiple new programs for our customers. We also filed comprehensive transportation plans in Minnesota and Wisconsin that are pending commission approval. We've advanced our ESG leadership and have been recognized by multiple entities, including an upgraded rating by MSCI from AA to AAA. And finally, we were named among the world's most ethical, admired and responsible companies, and we are recognized for being a best veteran employer as well as for our disability inclusion in the workplace. I'm really proud to lead a team that can deliver on operational, financial, environmental and diversity goals all simultaneously.\nLooking ahead, we're well positioned for sustainable organic growth over the next decade, including affordable renewable additions in our resource plans, the transmission needed to enable those carbon-free resources and responsible community transitions as we retire our coal plants.\nWe've recently issued requests for proposals in Minnesota, Colorado, and at SPS seeking approximately 6,000 megawatts of new renewable generation, a portion of the 10,000 megawatts that have been approved in our jurisdiction. We'll submit our recommended portfolios of generation assets to our commissions by the middle of this year and anticipate decisions in the second half of this year.\nWe also expect to issue additional RFPs in Minnesota and Colorado this year and next year for the remainder of our approved needs. As we've discussed in the past, we believe that we have a geographical advantage in the clean energy transition due to the strong wind and solar resources in our service territory. This access to low-cost renewable energy should also give us further advantage in developing green hydrogen and other clean fuel projects, which are becoming more feasible as a result of federal support from the Infrastructure and Jobs Act and the IRA.\nLate last year, we submitted hydrogen hub concept papers for both the Rocky Mountain and the Upper Midwest regions to the Department of Energy to compete for awards from the $8 billion hydrogen hub program. In December, we received favorable notice from the DOE for our concepts, and we're encouraged to submit full applications in April.\nIn addition, our pink hydrogen production pilot at our Prairie Island nuclear generating station is expected to be operational this year. Finally, we expect to bring forward opportunities this year to utilize clean fuels and green hydrogen blending at both our gas-fired generation stations and in our gas networks for home and building heating. As we continue to utilize innovative technologies to decarbonize our business, we are well positioned to take advantage of potentially significant hydrogen capital investment opportunities in the future.\nAs the penetration of renewable assets in our states increases, we're also interested in pursuing advanced storage opportunities to balance our electric system needs.\nToday, we're excited to announce a new partnership with Form Energy to develop 2 long-duration energy storage pilot projects. Form Energy's 100-hour battery technology could be a critical component to our decarbonization strategy, providing the resiliency and reliability that we need on the system to support our significant renewable portfolio.\nWe plan to deploy a 10-megawatt multi-day storage system at a retiring coal plant in both Minnesota and Colorado. These projects are expected to be online as early as 2025. And as we wrap up, I want to thank the thousands of employees who worked in below-zero temperatures and sustained high winds and several feet wet, heavy snow, to keep the lights on and the houses warm during our recent winter storms. Your efforts exemplify our company values of connected, committed, trustworthy and safe. And I believe that our dedicated employees and partners are what distinguishes Xcel Energy with our customers. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian.\n\nBrian J. Van Abel\n\nExecutive VP, CFO & Principal Accounting Officer, Xcel Energy Inc.\n\nThanks, Bob, and good morning all. We had another strong year, recording earnings of $3.17 per share for 2022 compared with $2.96 per share in 2021. This represents EPS growth of 7.1%, slightly above our long-term growth rate target of 5% to 7%. The most significant earnings drivers for the year included the following: higher electric and natural gas margins increased earnings by $1.05 per share, primarily driven by regulatory outcomes and riders to recover capital investments.\nIn addition, a lower effective tax rate increased earnings by $0.15 per share, but keep in mind, production tax credits lowered the ETR. PTCs are flowed back to customers through lower electric margin are largely earnings neutral. Offsetting these positive drivers were increased depreciation expense, which reduced earnings by $0.40 per share, reflecting our capital investment program.\nHigher O&M expense, which decreased earnings by $0.24 per share. Higher interest expense and other taxes, primarily property taxes, decreased earnings by $0.23 per share. And other items combined to reduce earnings by $0.12 per share.\nTurning to sales. Our weather-adjusted electric sales increased by 1.8%, largely due to higher C&I sales driven by strong economic activity in our service territories. We anticipate a modest slowing of our sales with growth of 1% in 2023.\nShifting to expense. O&M expenses increased $170 million for the year driven by costs related to technology and customer programs, storms, vegetation management inflation and additional actions due to weather. We also invested in our employees to ensure we retained our top talent. While we expect inflationary pressures to remain, we continue to focus on our continuous improvement programs, which we expect to drive increased productivity and efficiency. As a result, we anticipate O&M expenses will decline approximately 2% in 2023.\nWe've made progress on a number of regulatory proceedings. In the Minnesota Natural Gas rate case, the ALJ recommended the commission approve our settlement, which reflects a rate increase of $21 million, an ROE of 9.57%, an equity ratio of 52.5%, a decoupling mechanism and a property tax tracker. We anticipate the commission decision later this year.\nIn the Minnesota electric rate case, the commission accepted our proposal to reduce our request for MISO capacity revenue and established a tracker. Hearings were completed in December, and we continue to meet with the parties to see if we can reach a constructive settlement. However, we have a strong case and are comfortable with the fully litigated outcome (inaudible) the settlement. We anticipate a commission decision later in 2023.\nIn November of 2022, we filed an electric rate case in Colorado, seeking a net increase of $262 million based on an ROE of 10.25%, an equity ratio of 55.7% in the 2023 forward test year. We anticipate a commission decision and implementation of final rates in the third quarter.\nWe also filed a New Mexico electric rate case seeking a rate increase of $78 million based on an ROE of 10.75%, equity ratio of 54.7%, a forecast test year in the early retirement of the total coal plant. We anticipate a commission decision and implementation of final rates in the fourth quarter. As far as future filings, we plan to file a Texas rate case later in the quarter and Wisconsin in the second quarter.\nAs we have discussed in the past, the inflation Reduction Act provides significant customer benefits. Key elements include the following: Tax credit transferability will provide $1.8 billion of liquidity, increasing cash flow and reducing equity needs. We've met with companies in our service territory and expect to enter into bilateral tax credit sale contracts later this year. Our FFO to debt metrics improved by 100 basis points during the forecast time period. The solar PTC and tax credit transferability improved the competitiveness of our renewable bids, and we anticipate pricing will decline on solar projects by 25% to 40% and wind projects by 50% to 60% due to the new and extended tax credits which is great for our customers as we embark on this clean energy transition.\nFinally, we don't anticipate any material impact from AMT as a result of makers' depreciation and existing tax credits on our balance sheet. We are reaffirming our 2023 earnings guidance range of $3.30 to $3.40 per share, which is consistent with our long-term EPS growth objective of 5% to 7%. We have updated our key assumptions to reflect actual year-end results, which are detailed in our earnings release.\nWith that, I'll wrap up with a quick summary. We had a strong operational and financial year in 2022. We delivered 2022 earnings within our guidance range, the 18th consecutive year and increased our dividend for the 19th consecutive year. We received approval of our resource plans in Colorado and Minnesota, which will result in approximately 10,000 megawatts of new renewables.\nThe Inflation Reduction Act has passed a significant benefits for our customers in the company. We are reaffirming 2023 guidance consistent with our long-term earnings growth rate. We remain confident we can continue to deliver long-term earnings and dividend growth within the upper half of our 5% to 7% of objective range as we lead the clean energy transition and keep bills low for our customers. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now take questions."

My name is George, I'll be a coordinator for today's events. Please note, this conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]\nI'd now like to hand the call over to your host today, Mr. Paul Johnson, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations to begin today's conference. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nPaul Andrew Johnson\n\nVP & IR, Xcel Energy Inc.\n\nThank you. Good morning, and welcome to Xcel Energy's third quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Bob Frenzel, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Van Abel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In addition, we have other members of the management team in the room to answer questions if needed. This morning, we will review our third quarter results and highlights, share recent business and regulatory developments, update our capital and financing plans and provide 2024 guidance. Slides that accompany today's call are available on our website.\nAs a reminder, some of the comments during today's call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our SEC filings. Today, we'll discuss certain measures that are non-GAAP measures. Information on comparable GAAP measures and reconciliations are included in our earnings release.\nEarly this week, a jury in Denver District Court found Xcel Energy liable and its dispute with core cooperative regarding prior year's lost power damages at our Comanche power plant. We intend to appeal the decision. For the third quarter of 2023, we recorded GAAP earnings of $1.19 per share, which includes a onetime nonrecurring tax charge of $34 million related to the ongoing legal dispute. As a result, we have taken a nonrecurring charge of $0.05 per share, which we don't consider part of ongoing earnings. All for the discussion in our earnings call will focus on earning -- on ongoing earnings. For more information on this matter, please see the disclosure in our earnings release.\nI'll now turn the call over to Bob.\n\nRobert C. Frenzel\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Xcel Energy, Inc.\n\nThanks, Paul, and good morning, everybody. Let's start with the quarter.\nWe had solid results recording ongoing earnings of $1.23 per share for 2023 compared to $1.18 per share in 2022. As a result, we're narrowing our '23 ongoing earnings guidance to $3.32 to $3.37 per share. We're also initiating 2024 ongoing earnings guidance of $3.50 to $3.60 per share, which is consistent with our 5% to 7% long-term EPS growth rate.\nConsistent with [indiscernible] practices, we've reviewed our customer and operational needs and have updated our infrastructure plan for 2024 to 2028. This revised forecast reflects $34 billion of needed capital investment, an increase of $4 billion from our previous plan. This base infrastructure investment plan includes substantial resiliency investments in both transmission and distribution including additional upgrades required to support the Colorado Energy Plan. However, it does not include clean energy generation investments that could result from the resource plans in Colorado, Texas, New Mexico, or in the Upper Midwest. If approved by our commissions, these cost-effective clean energy generation investments could result in an additional capital need totaling $10 billion from 2024 to 2028 and dramatically reduced carbon emissions in various states.\nXcel Energy's resource plans also demonstrate the benefits of the Inflation Reduction Act, our state's geographic advantages that enable high-capacity renewable generation and our operational expertise and commercial acumen can bring to our customers. In September, we filed our recommended plan in Colorado. This plan seeks to double the amount of renewable [indiscernible] in the state, making it the largest clean energy transition effort in Colorado history and demonstrates our strong element with the state's environmental goals.\nOur proposal contemplates the shutdown or conversion of our remaining coal units replaces them with approximately 6,500 megawatts of renewable energy and battery storage and 600 megawatts of dispatchable gas resources to ensure system reliability in times of low wind or solar conditions. These amounts include 4,800 megawatts as proposed to be owned and operated by Xcel Energy for the benefit of our customers. Including the approximately $3 billion in required transmission investments to ensure deliverability and reliability, this Colorado energy plan represents nearly an $11 billion total investment by Xcel Energy.\nIn addition, this portfolio also includes $10 billion in IRA savings to customers. It creates local jobs, promote economic development and provides over $2 billion in tax benefits to local communities in the coming decades. At the same time, it will reduce carbon emissions by over 80% from 2005 levels in Colorado will have an expected annual rate impact of only 2.3%. This competitive portfolio provides our Colorado customers an industry-leading opportunity for a cleaner economy at a fraction of the cost most other states would incur.\nMoving to Minnesota. In September, the commission approved 350 megawatts of new renewable generation, including an additional 250 megawatts at our Sherco facility. This brings the total amount of company built solar at Sherco to over 700 MW making it one of the largest solar facilities in the country. In October, we also issued an RFP seeking 1,200 megawatts of wind that will utilize our transmission interconnect at our retiring Sherco coal facility and we'll be issuing additional RFPs to fulfill the remainder of the approved Upper Midwest Resource Plan in 2024.\nFinally, in October, we filed a resource plan in New Mexico. Based on our filing, SPS could require additional 5,000 to 10,000 megawatts of new generation by the end of the decade to accommodate increasing demand, plant retirements and ensure resiliency and reliability of the grid. We've already proposed [indiscernible] megawatts of company-owned solar and battery projects that are pending commission approval. We anticipate filing another RFP in 2024 and for the additional generation resources.\nShifting to our clean energy innovation projects. The Department of Energy recently announced nearly $1.5 billion in awards to support multiple Xcel Energy affiliated projects. Starting with the Heartland Hydrogen Hub, this estimated $5 billion initiative, which includes multiple projects from Xcel Energy and others received an award of up to $925 million by the DOE. This game-changing funding will serve as a catalyst for clean hydrogen ecosystem in the Upper Midwest and the foundation of our clean fuels efforts at Xcel Energy.\nFortunately, the Western Interstate hydrogen hub in Colorado, New Mexico, Wyoming [indiscernible] was not successful in this round of DOE funding. And that said, we remain committed to working with policymakers and federal offices with the hopes that our projects can progress to advance our shared clean energy goals.\nThe deal we also awarded Xcel Energy up to $70 million to [ support ] [indiscernible] 10-megawatt 100-hour battery pilots with [indiscernible] Energy. Combined with the grants from breakthrough Energy's Catalyst Fund, we secured up to $90 million to support these long-duration energy storage pilots, a critical asset class to ensure cost-effective, reliability in a high renewable grid.\nWith respect to [indiscernible] grid resilience and innovation partnerships program, Xcel Energy was selected as part of 2 different awards. First, the deal we awarded Xcel Energy a $100 million to support projects to mitigate the threat of wildfires and ensure resiliency of the grid through extreme weather. Projects include vegetation management, selective undergrounding, advanced infrastructure technologies, drones and several additional resiliency projects. Xcel Energy also [indiscernible] $464 million grant to expand transmission as part of the MISO and SPP [indiscernible] program to fund high-voltage transmission to improve interregional transfer capability, reliability and resolve grid constraints.\nWe're appreciative of the DOE support as well as many of our partners in these projects, including our state and regional transmission organizations. Funding support helps us accelerate critical carbon-free technologies, enhance safety and resiliency while keeping costs low for customers.\nTurning to our natural gas utility. In August, we filed our Clean Heat program in Colorado. This first-of-a-kind plan provides a framework, reduce greenhouse gas emissions consistent with state goals in our net zero emissions target. The [ Point Fast Track ] solutions such as electrification, demand side management, clean fuels and certified natural gas. The proposed Clean Heat Plus portfolio reduces greenhouse and gas emissions by 28% by 2030, ensures customer reliability and choice while optimizing customer bill impact. We plan to file a natural gas innovation plan, a corresponding framework for our Minnesota gas utility in the fourth quarter.\nIn September, Meta announced construction of a $700 million data center in Minnesota, which eventually could be one of the largest customers in the state. We continue to evaluate a number of additional data center and commercial opportunities that will further support growth and economic development in our committees.\nFinally, there are not many new material developments with the Marshall Wildfire litigation. We currently have 14 complaints with 675 plaintiffs, which have been consolidated into a single case. For the past 4 years, Xcel Energy has been operating under a commission-approved wildfire mitigation program in Colorado. We intend to file an updated wildfire mitigation plan next year, which will include a wide range of options for stakeholder consideration, including the technologies, undergrounding, additional vegetation management, composite poles, selective use of covered conductor and preventative power system shutoffs.\nLet me wrap up with just a few summary comments before I turn it over to Brian. As we look forward across the next 5 years and beyond, we see a future that is bright for our communities, our customers and our investors. Xcel Energy is committed to providing a clean energy economy [indiscernible] regions and it will require meaningful investment to accomplish.\nFor our customers, we have the potential to deploy 15,000 to 20,000 megawatts of new clean generation on our systems by 2030, dramatically lowering our emissions profile, affordably powering our customers' homes and businesses, while ensuring 99.99% reliability that they come to expect from Xcel Energy. And through leveraging the benefits of the IRA and the IIJA, we are able to accelerate deployment of renewable resources in pairing them with affordable energy storage assets and other firm dispatchable clean fuel resources to provide reliability.\nWe continue to invest in and innovate our transmission and distribution systems to ensure reliability and resilience and provide for regional and interregional deliverability. We're laying the framework to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions on our natural gas system. All the while our residential customer electric and natural gas builds are amongst the lowest in the country, 28% and 14% below the national average. And given that the regions where we serve customers are the most resource rich in wind and solar, we believe that we can lead this clean energy transition for our customers more cost-effectively than almost any other company.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Brian.\n\nBrian J. Van Abel\n\nTreasurer & Vice President, Xcel Energy, Inc.\n\nThanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. We had ongoing earnings of $1.23 per share for the third quarter of 2023, compared to $1.18 per share in 2022. The most significant earnings drivers for the quarter included the following: Lower O&M expenses increased earnings by $0.03 share which reflects the impact of cost containment actions, lower effective tax rate and conservation and demand side management expenses, which increased earnings $0.03 per share. Note that these items are apparently offset in lower margins are earnings neutral. In addition, other items combined to increase earnings by $0.04 per share.\nOffsetting these positive drivers, higher interest charges, which decreased earnings by $0.03 per share, driven by rising interest rates and increased debt levels to fund capital investment and higher depreciation and amortization expense, which decreased earnings by $0.02 per share, reflecting our capital investment program.\nTurning to sales. Year-to-date weather-adjusted electric sales increased by 1.1%, largely driven by strong C&I sales. As a result, we now expect annual electric sales growth of 1% to 2% in 2023.\nShifting to expenses. On decreased $25 million for the third quarter, reflecting management actions to lower costs. We now expect our annual O&M expenses to decline by 1% to 2%.\nDuring the third quarter, we also made progress in several regulatory proceedings and we are getting close to wrapping up a busy regulatory year. 2024 will be much lighter from a rate case perspective. In our Colorado electric rate case, the commission approved our settlement that reflects a $95 million rate increase based on an ROE of 9.3% and an equity ratio of 55.7%. Rates were effective in September.\nIn October, the New Mexico Commission approved our electric rate case settlement. That reflects a rate increase of $33 million, [indiscernible] ROE of 9.5%, an equity ratio of 54.7%, a forward test year, an acceleration of total depreciation to 2028. Rates were effective in October.\nIn our pending Texas electric rate case, we reached a settlement in principle on revenue requirements. We're hopeful the parties will reach agreement on class cost allocation and rate design so that we can file the settlement this year. We expect a decision in the implementation rates in the first quarter of 2024. And as a reminder, we have a relate back date to July 13.\nIn New Wisconsin, we continue to work through the regulatory process for our electric and natural gas rate cases and expect the commission decision by year-end.\nWith regards to future rate cases, we plan to file a natural gas rate case for Minnesota in the order and the potential Colorado natural gas rate case in the first quarter of next year.\nUpdating our progress on production tax credit transferability, we recently executed 2 contracts totaling $250 million. We anticipate further PTC sales in the fourth quarter, consistent with our plan totaling $300 million to $400 million for the year. Transferability lowers the cost of our renewable energy projects for our customers and reduces near-term funding needs.\nMoving to our updated capital forecast. We've issued a robust $34 billion 5-year base capital plan with annual rate base growth of 7.6%. The base plan reflects commission approved renewable projects, including over 700 megawatts of new solar at Sherco. The base plan also reflects significant rate and resiliency investments, including our Colorado Power Pathway, transition to support our Colorado preferred plan, MISO [indiscernible] and investments as well as other system investments to maintain asset health and reliability.\nIn addition, we have additional capital investment opportunities for our renewables and firm capacity associated with the Colorado preferred plan, 418 megawatts of proposed self-built solar and [indiscernible] SBS and further RFPs in NSP and SPS. We'll update our base capital plan after our various commissions complete their review and finalize their decisions regarding our proposals.\nThese opportunities, if approved, could to translate to $10 billion of additional investment through 2028, resulting in annual rate base growth of 10.7%.\nWe've updated our base financing plan, which reflects $15 billion of debt and $2.5 billion of equity. We anticipate that any incremental capital investment would be funded by approximately 40% equity and 60% debt. It is important to recognize that we've always maintained a balanced financing strategy which includes a mix of debt and equity to fund accretive growth while maintaining a strong balance sheet and credit metrics. Maintaining solid [indiscernible] favorable access to capital markets are critical to fund our clean energy transition, deliver strong shareholder returns and keep customer bills low, especially with rising interest rates.\nShifting to our earnings. We've updated our 2023 guidance assumptions to [indiscernible] the latest information. We're also narrowing our 2023 ongoing earnings guide range to $3.32 to $3.37 per share. We have a long history of delivering on our financial [indiscernible] and expect to continue that trend in 2023. As a result, we anticipate strong earnings in the fourth quarter that will result in achieving our earnings guidance. Key drivers include incremental revenue from the Colorado and New Mexico electric rate cases, deferral of certain O&M depreciation and interest expenses as part of the Texas electric rate case, strong O&M cost management and better-than-expected sales growth.\nFinally, we are initiating our 2024 ongoing earnings guidance range of $3.50 to $3.60 per share, which is consistent with our long-term EPS growth objective of 5% to 7%. Key assumptions are detailed in our earnings release.\nWith that, I'll wrap up with a quick summary. We continue to execute on our clean energy plans, leveraging the benefits of the IRA to reduce cost for our customers. We proposed a game-changing preferred plan in Colorado, which results in one of the most aggressive renewable [indiscernible] in the country. We secured DOE grants for our Heartland Hydrogen Hub, wildfire mitigation plans, [indiscernible] energy pilots and transmission [indiscernible], which will accelerate breakthrough technology in the [indiscernible] at a lower cost for our customers. We resolved rate cases in Colorado and New Mexico, while reaching a settlement in principle in Texas. We're narrowing our 2023 ongoing earnings guidance and continue to expect to deliver within our guidance range as we have for the past 18 years. We announced a robust updated capital investment program and initiated 2024 guidance that provides strong, transparent rate base growth and customer value. And finally, we remain confident we continue to deliver long-term earnings and dividend growth within the upper half of our 5% to 7% objective range as we lead the clean energy transition and continue to keep bills low for our customers.\nThis concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now take questions."

Questions will only be taken from institutional investors. Reporters can contact Media Relations with inquiries and individual investors and others can reach out to Investor Relations. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Paul Johnson, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nPaul Andrew Johnson\n\nVP of IR & Treasurer, Xcel Energy Inc.\n\nGood morning, and welcome to Xcel Energy's 2022 Second Quarter Earnings Call. Joining me today are Bob Frenzel, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Van Abel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In addition, we have other members of the management team in the room to answer your questions if needed.\nThis morning, we will review our 2022 results, share recent business and regulatory developments. Slides that accompany today's call are available on our website. As a reminder, some comments made during today's call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our SEC filings. Today, we will discuss certain metrics that are non-GAAP measures. Information on the comparable GAAP measures and reconciliations are included in our earnings release. With that, I'll turn it over to Bob.\n\nRobert C. Frenzel\n\nPresident, CEO & Chairman, Xcel Energy Inc.\n\nThanks, Paul. Good morning, everybody. It was certainly an interesting 11th hour twist in legislative news last evening, but we'll get to that in just a minute. Let's start with our financial results. We had another solid quarter, recording earnings of $0.60 per share in 2022 compared with $0.58 per share in '21. Our earnings are on track with expectations, and as a result, we are reaffirming our 2022 earnings guidance of $3.10 to $3.20 per share.\nDuring the quarter, we made good progress on our clean energy plan, achieving constructive regulatory outcomes. In June, the Colorado Commission approved our resource plan settlement, which includes approximately 4,000 megawatts of utility scale renewable additions. The conversion of our Pawnee coal plant to natural gas by the end of 2025, and the early retirement of our Comanche 3 coal unit by the end of 2030, which will be the final coal plant retirement in Colorado.\nWe now have the approval of both our Minnesota and our Colorado resource plans, which together will add 10,000 megawatts of utility-scale renewables to our system and achieve an 85% carbon reduction by 2030. We anticipate issuing RFPs later this year, submitting our recommended portfolios by mid-2023 and receiving commission decisions in the second half of 2023.\nWe expect the recommended portfolio of generation assets will include self-build, build-own transfers and power purchase agreements. Our plans are consistent with our steel-for-fuel strategy, which provides a valuable hedge for our customers against rising commodity prices. Our owned wind farms are projected to generate nearly $1 billion of fuel-related customer savings in 2022 alone in a total of $2.7 billion since 2017.\nWe're excited about our transmission expansion opportunity. MISO's long-term planning approach identified projects in Futures 1 with an estimated investment of $30 billion that will be awarded in 4 discrete tranches. Earlier this week, the MISO board approved Tranche 1, which includes $10 billion in projects. Based on the most recent information from MISO, we anticipate a $1.2 billion investment opportunity for Xcel Energy within Tranche 1.\nTurning to electric vehicles. We're making progress on our goal to power 1.5 million EVs by 2030, supporting our states in achieving their electrification goals. We are excited to be the first U.S. energy company to introduce all electric bucket trucks to our fleet, and we expect to file comprehensive transportation plans in Minnesota and Wisconsin in early August. These state proposals include single and multifamily residential offerings, commercial customer programs as well as a school bus pilot.\nIn addition, we're looking to accelerate EV adoption through the development of high-speed public charging infrastructure, by partnering with our states and other organizations. The proposed programs will also foster customer affordability, providing significant fuel savings for EV drivers and helping to keep bills affordable for all customers through load growth and enabling more efficient utilization of distribution grid infrastructure.\nThe Minnesota, Wisconsin proposals reflect capital investment of approximately $325 million from 2024 to 2026, which does not include distribution investment needed to upgrade the grid. Xcel Energy's clean energy leadership, including our long-standing track record of carbon reduction is a direct result of the passion that our dedicated employees bring to serve our customers and our communities.\nEarlier this month, we received another exemplary rating from the Institute of Nuclear Power Operators for our Prairie Island Nuclear Power Plant. We've continued to improve performance and cost efficiencies, demonstrating sustainable excellence in operations. I want to congratulate and thank all of our nuclear employees, support teams, contractors and suppliers for their commitment and impact. Nuclear remains a very important source of reliable carbon-free energy. We're proud to be one of the top operators in the nation.\nYesterday, it was announced, Senator, Schumer and Manchin had reached agreement on the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. While we still need to analyze the details to understand all of the nuances of the act, it appears to include nearly all the broader clean energy tax credits, including new and extended tax credits for wind, solar, hydrogen storage and nuclear. While it doesn't include direct pay for all taxpayers for all tax credits, it does include tax credit transferability as an option when direct pay is unavailable.\nAs we previously discussed, our capital investment plan is not dependent on changes in federal policy. However, the energy provisions included in the act would provide substantial customer benefits and help enable our clean energy transition while keeping our customer bills affordable. There's still a lot of twists and turns that can happen in Washington, but we're optimistic that the bill could become long.\nThis past quarter, we were honored to be among the first companies inducted into the Climate Leadership Hall of Fame, which recognizes different organizations across the country for exemplary leadership in response to climate change. We're also recognized with the Hubert H. Humphrey Public Leadership Award for our groundbreaking sustainability goals in Minnesota. And finally, we received the EEI National Key Accounts Award for outstanding customer engagement, which recognizes companies and their account executives for providing excellent support and offerings to corporate customers.\nOur customers are at the heart of everything we do. And it's great to be recognized for our work and helping them achieve their goals. I want to thank these organizations for the recognition, along with our employees, partners and stakeholders who make it possible. And with that, I'll turn it over to Brian.\n\nBrian J. Van Abel\n\nExecutive VP, CFO & Principal Accounting Officer, Xcel Energy Inc.\n\nThanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. We had another solid quarter, recording earnings of $0.60 per share for the second quarter of 2022, compared with $0.58 per share in 2021. The most significant earnings drivers for the quarter included the following: higher electric and natural gas margins increased earnings by $0.25 per share, primarily driven by riders and regulatory outcomes to recover our capital investments. In addition, a lower effective tax rate increased earnings by $0.06 per share. But keep in mind, production tax credits lowered the ETR. However, PTCs are flowed back to customers through lower electric margin and are largely earnings neutral.\nOffsetting these positive drivers were increased depreciation expense, which reduced earnings by $0.15 per share, reflecting our capital investment program and the recognition of previously deferred costs related to the Texas electric Rate Case, higher O&M expense which decreased earnings by $0.02 per share, higher interest expense and other taxes, primarily property taxes, decreased earnings by $0.08 per share. And other items combined to reduce earnings by $0.04 per share.\nTurning to sales. Weather-adjusted electric sales increased by 3.1% for the first 6 months of 2022, largely due to higher C&I sales, driven by strong economic activity in our service territories. In addition, our unemployment rate is 80 basis points below the national average. As a result, we have revised our assumption for 2022 sales growth to 2%.\nO&M expenses increased $14 million for the second quarter, primarily driven by the recognition of previously deferred expenses related to the Texas Electric Rate Case, additional investments in technology and customer programs and increased costs for storms and vegetation management. Like other businesses, we are facing inflationary pressures and now expect an annual O&M increase of approximately 2%.\nIn addition to the Colorado resource plan approval, we also made strong progress on a number of other regulatory proceedings. The Colorado Commission approved our Uri Storm settlement, including full recovery of all costs with the exception of an $8 million disallowance, primarily related to conservation messaging. In Minnesota, an ALJ recommended full recovery of all Uri-related fuel costs. We anticipate a commission decision later this summer.\nIn Texas, the commission approved our electric rate case settlement, which provides a rate increase of $89 million. Rates were effective back to March 2021, which is why you see some year-to-date true-ups in revenue and various expense lines of the income statement. The agreement also accelerates the depreciation lives of the Tolk coal plant to 2034. We have a pending natural gas case in Colorado, seeking a rate increase of approximately $175 million over 3 years, based on ROE of 10.25% and an equity ratio of 55.7%.\nIn June, intervener testimony was filed. The staff recommended an ROE of 9%, an equity ratio of 55% in a historic test year. While the UCA recommended a 9% ROE, an equity ratio of 51.5% in the historic test year. In July, we filed rebuttal testimony providing additional support for our filed position. Hearings are scheduled for late August. We anticipate a commission decision later this year with final rates implemented in November of this year.\nWe recently filed our first electric rate case in South Dakota since 2014. We are seeking a $44 million revenue increase based on an ROE of 10.75% and equity ratio of 53% in the historic test year. We expect a decision in final rates implemented in the first quarter of 2023. We also have pending electric and natural gas rate cases in Minnesota. We are in the discovery phase and expect intervener testimony this fall, followed by commission decisions in 2023. Details on these cases and schedules are included in our earnings release.\nShifting to earnings. We've updated our 2022 guidance assumptions to reflect the latest information. Details are included in our earnings release. We are reaffirming our 2022 earnings guidance range of $3.10 to $3.20 per share, which is consistent with our long-term 5% to 7% EPS growth objective. With that, I'll wrap up with a quick summary.\nThe Colorado Commission approved our resource plan and Storm Uri costs recovery settlement. We received an ALJ recommendation in Minnesota for full recovery of fuel costs related to Winter Storm Uri. We will be filing our Midwest EV plan shortly. The Texas Commission approved our rate case settlement. We are reaffirming our 2022 earnings guidance, and we remain confident we can continue to deliver long-term earnings and dividend growth within the upper half of our 5% to 7% objective range as we lead the clean energy transition and keep bills well for our customers. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now take questions."

At Xcel, we had another strong quarter, recording earnings of $0.70 per share for 2022 compared with $0.67 per share in 2021. And as a result, we're reaffirming our 2022 earnings guidance of $3.10 to $3.20 per share. During the quarter, we made strong progress on our clean energy plan, achieving significant and constructive regulatory outcomes.\nIn February, the Minnesota Commission approved our resource plan, which achieved an 85% carbon reduction in a full coal exit by 2030. Other key components include an early retirement of the King coal plant in 2028 in the Sherco Unit 3 in 2030. 10-year extension of our Monticello nuclear facility, in the addition of approximately 6,000 megawatts of new wind and solar resources.\nThe ownership of 2 new generation time lines associated with the retiring coal plants as well as the associated 2,600 megawatts of renewable resources on those lines. And finally, the commission recognized the need for approximately 800 megawatts of firm dispatchable resources, which will go through a separate certificate of need process. As you can tell that based on the latest MISO capacity auction results, it's critical that we add these firm dispatchable resources to ensure the reliability and affordability of the transition for our customers.\nShifting to Colorado earlier this week, we reached a revised settlement on our electric resource plan. As a result, additional parties joined that settlement. The revised agreement further accelerates the retirement of our Comanche 3 coal unit to no later than January 1, 2031, which we believe addresses the concerns expressed by the commission during previous deliberations, settlement includes approximately 4,000 megawatts of renewable additions and the conversion of our Pawnee coal plant to natural gas no later than January 1, 2026.\nThis resource plan is expected to reduce carbon by at least 85% by 2030. We believe the revised settlement will enable the commission to rule on the resource plan in June. Together, our Minnesota and Colorado Resource Plan will add nearly 10,000 megawatts of renewables to our system and achieve an 85% carbon reduction by 2030. This is consistent with our steel-for-fuel strategy which provides a significant hedge against rising commodity prices and is projected to generate over $1 billion of fuel-related customer savings in 2022 alone.\nIn terms of next steps, we anticipate issuing RFPs in the second half of this year with insight into the preferred portfolio early next year and commission decisions in the first half of 2023. We expect the recommended portfolio of generation assets will include self-build, build-own transfers as well as some power purchase agreements. This time line represents a modest delay in our original plans, but provides additional time for more clarity given the solar supply chain considerations.\nLast quarter, the Colorado Commission approved our $1.7 billion Pathway transmission project to enable access to 5,500 megawatts of new renewables in some of the richest wind and solar resources in the region. The commission also conditionally approved the 90-mile May Valley to Longhorn line extension with an additional investment opportunity of approximately $250 million. These constructive regulatory outcomes reflect our alignment with our commissions on our clean energy transition, which is critical as we work to deliver reliable, affordable and sustainable energy to the states, the communities and the customers that we serve.\nWe also remain excited about the transmission expansion opportunities in our Midwest region. MISO's future 1 scenario, which reflects an estimated $30 billion of investment opportunities expected to be awarded in 4 discrete tranches. Tranche 1 includes roughly $10 billion of projects and MISO decision on that tranche is anticipated this July. Our preliminary estimates suggest a $1 billion to $2 billion investment opportunity for Xcel Energy within Tranche 1, and we expect to have more clarity this summer after MISO provides more detail on the recommended portfolio. Longer term, we expect to be awarded approximately $5 billion to $6 billion in total Future 1 investments.\nAnd as we've previously discussed, our capital investment plan is not dependent on changes in federal policy. However, the energy provisions that were included in the Build Back Better legislation would provide substantial customer benefits and help enable our clean energy transition while keeping our customer bills affordable.\nWhile that legislation has stalled, there is ongoing discussion of a more modest version potentially moving forward this year. We would expect it to include new and extended tax credits for wind, solar, hydrogen, storage, nuclear and even transmission along with a direct pay option for those tax credits. We continue to work with our federal delegation as well as the EEI to advocate for these provisions, which we believe would benefit our customers and accelerate a clean energy transition nationally.\nShifting to electric vehicles. We are executing well on our approved Colorado and New Mexico plans, and we recently received approval of our transportation plan in Minnesota, which outline future program focus areas and allows for implementation of new, fast chargers in our service territory in Minnesota.\nWe're also supporting comprehensive transportation legislation in Minnesota that includes the potential for customer rebates similar to what we're implementing in Colorado. We're planning a more substantial update around these programs this summer to coincide with potential federal funding from the IIJA, and these are important steps in helping drive electric vehicle adoption as we support the goals of our states.\nGiven strong alignment with our states on EV goals and our progress to date, we continue to anticipate significant long-term investment opportunities and load growth from electric vehicles. We've made significant progress this quarter, and I'm proud of the way our teams delivered those results. Our regulatory settlements and outcomes reflect our diligent efforts to listen, engage and collaborate with our many stakeholders, not just through regulatory processes, but also through our sustainability priorities and our core values. We have a history of strong storm restoration, and earlier this month had another opportunity to showcase our operational excellence when we experienced 2 feet of snow in North Dakota. Our teams were prepared and restore power to customers quickly despite battling frigid conditions.\nOur system resilience and storm preparatives are great examples of our continued discipline and proactive planning, strong execution and our employees' commitment to customer service. We strive to deliver our company values every day. And as a result, we were again named as one of the World's Most Ethical Companies by Ethisphere. And the World's Most Admired Companies by Fortune. We're also recognized by Military Times and GI Jobs for our continued commitment to veteran hiring.\nAnd finally, I want to pause and remember that today, April 28 is Workers' Memorial Day, which for more than 50 years has been a day of remembrance for workers who've been injured or killed in the line of work. I want to acknowledge that all the women and men of Xcel Energy, our contractor partners and all utility workers across the country sacrifice to provide the critical energy needs of our customers and our communities.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to Brian.\n\nBrian J. Van Abel\n\nExecutive VP, CFO & Principal Accounting Officer, Xcel Energy Inc.\n\nThanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. We had another solid quarter, recording earnings of $0.70 per share for the first quarter of 2022 and compared with $0.67 per share in 2021. The most significant earnings drivers for the quarter included the following: higher electric and natural gas margins increased earnings by $0.12 per share, primarily driven by riders and regulatory outcomes to recover our capital investments.\nIn addition, a lower effective tax rate increased earnings by $0.05 per share. But keep in mind, production tax credits lowered the ETR. However, PTCs are flowed back to customers through lower electric margin and are largely earnings neutral. Offsetting these positive drivers were increased depreciation expense, which reduced earnings by $0.06 per share, reflecting our capital investment program; higher O&M expense, which decreased earnings by $0.02 per share; higher interest expense and other taxes, primarily property taxes decreased earnings by $0.02 per share; and other items combined to reduce earnings by $0.04 per share.\nTurning to sales. Weather-adjusted electric sales increased by 3.9% for the first quarter of 2022, largely due to higher C&I sales driven by improved economic activity as COVID impacts lessen. Our unemployment rate is 60 basis points below the national average, and our economies are growing faster than the average of the country. As a result, we've increased our 2022 electric sales growth assumption of 1% to 2%. Our O&M expenses increased $18 million for the first quarter, primarily driven by higher insurance costs and additional investments in technology and our customer programs.\nWe now project an annual O&M increase of approximately 1%. While Bob touched on the resource plan and transmission regulatory approvals this past quarter, we also made strong progress on various rate cases. In March, the Colorado Commission approved our electric rate case settlement, which will provide a net rate increase of $177 million based on an ROE of 9.3% and an equity ratio of 55.7%. New rates were effective in April.\nIn February, New Mexico Commission approved our electric rate case settlement, which will provide a net rate increase of $62 million and includes an ROE of 9.35% and an equity ratio of 54.7% for determining the revenue requirements for our wind projects. Rates were effective at the end of February.\nNow every settlement is based on compromises, and we feel these are constructive outcomes for all parties. We also have pending rate cases in all the jurisdictions. In Texas, we have a blackbox settlement in our electric rate case, which provides a rate increase of approximately $89 million. The agreement also accelerates the depreciation life of the Tolk coal plant to 2034. The commission decision is anticipated later this year.\nWe also have pending electric and natural gas rate cases in Minnesota and are early in the process. We're in the discovery phase and expecting intervenor testimony this fall, followed by commission decisions in 2023. In addition, we'll look for opportunities to resettlements on both these cases after intervenor testimony has been filed.\nEarlier this year, we filed a natural gas case in Colorado, the request is driven by significant capital investment to support continued customer growth, safety, reliability and resiliency. We anticipate a commission decision later this year and final rates to be implemented in November 2022. Details on these cases and schedules are included in our earnings release. Shifting to earnings. We've updated our 2022 guidance assumptions to reflect our latest information. Details are included in our earnings release.\nPlease note, our depreciation expense assumption has increased to reflect regulatory recovery in Colorado and New Mexico. In addition, the decreasing capital riders in the lower ETR reflect an IRS increase in the value of the PTC. These assumption changes are largely earnings neutral.\nFinally, the combination of increased sales growth, favorable weather and lower O&M costs are expected to mitigate the headwind associated with replacement power costs related to Comanche 3 and increased interest expense due to rising rates. As a result, we are reaffirming our 2022 earnings guidance range of $3.10 to $3.20 per share, which is consistent with our long-term 5% to 7% EPS growth objective.\nWith that, I'll wrap up with a quick summary. The Minnesota Commission approved our research plan. The Colorado Commission approved our electric rate case settlement and Pathway transmission project. We reached a revised settlement on the Colorado Resource Plan, which has the support of additional parties and accelerated retirement of Comanche 3 to no later than January 1, 2021.\nWe are reaffirming our 2022 earnings guidance. And we remain confident, we can continue to deliver long-term earnings and dividend growth within the upper half of our 5% to 7% objective range as we lead the clean energy transition and keep bills low for our customers. This concludes our prepared remarks. And operator, we will now take questions."

My name is Melissa, and I will be your coordinator for today's event. Please note, this conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]. I'll now turn the call over to Paul Johnson, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nPaul Andrew Johnson\n\nVP & IR, Xcel Energy Inc.\n\nGood morning, welcome to Xcel Energy's 2023 Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. Joining me today are Bob Frenzel, Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Van Abel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In addition, we have other members of the management team in the room to answer your questions if needed.\nThis morning, we will review our 23 results and highlights, share recent business and regulatory updates and provide updates on our long-term growth plans.\nSlides accompany today's call are available on our website. As a reminder, some of the comments during today's call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ both anticipated are described in our earnings release and our SEC filings.\nToday, we'll discuss certain metrics that are non-GAAP measures. Information on the comparable GAAP measures and reconciliations are included in our earnings release.\nIn the fourth quarter, Xcel implemented several workforce actions to streamline the organization, ensure resources are aligned with business and customer needs to ensure our long-term success.\nXcel initiated a voluntary retirement program under which 400 nonbargaining employees retired. In addition, we eliminated 159 bargaining positions. As a result, we recorded a workforce reduction expense of $72 million or $0.09 per share in the fourth quarter of '23.\nAlso in '23, we recorded a charge of $35 million or $0.05 per share related to a legal dispute between core and Xcel Energy regarding prior year operations at the Comanche 3 coal plant. Given the nonrecurring nature of these items, both have been excluded from ongoing earnings. As a result, our GAAP earnings were $3.21 per share, while ongoing earnings, which exclude these nonrecurring charges were $3.35 per share.\nAll further discussions in this earnings call will focus on ongoing earnings. For more information on this, please see the disclosures in our earnings release.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Bob.\n\nRobert C. Frenzel\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Xcel Energy, Inc.\n\nThanks, Paul, and good morning, everybody. We had another successful year at Xcel Energy continuing to provide our customers with safe, clean, reliable and affordable energy while delivering an operational and financial performance.\nIn 2023, we executed on the largest capital program in Xcel Energy history, investing approximately $6 billion to improve resiliency and enabling clean energy for our customers while delivering economic growth and vitality for our communities.\nOur investments in operations enabled ongoing earnings of $3.35 per share representing the 19th consecutive year of meeting or exceeding our earnings guidance. Meeting our financial commitments is critical to maintaining a competitive cost of capital, which benefits our customers as we access the capital markets to fund our operations.\nIn December, we received approval for our ground breaking clean energy portfolio with over 5,800 megawatts of new generation resources. This $4.8 billion of new generation investment, which when coupled with the necessary transmission represents almost an $8 billion worth of commitments in Colorado to deliver a cleaner energy economy.\nI'm proud of how our teams partnered with so many stakeholders to deliver on these achievements. And as I look back on the year, we accomplished so many other great outcomes.\nWhile the final values aren't in yet, our SADIS scores improved and we believe we'll be in the top quartile of U.S. utilities for delivering reliable electricity to our customers. Across our wind fleet, we continue to deliver strong net capacity performance and exceeded our corporate availability target for the third consecutive year.\nWe navigated a very busy regulatory calendar resolving multiple rate cases and reached a pending settlement in our Texas electric rate case. We filed our clean heat plan in Colorado and our natural gas innovation plan in Minnesota, providing a framework in both of those states to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions for our natural gas customers.\nWe've approved transportation electrification programs in New Mexico and in Wisconsin, along with updated transportation plans pending commission approval in both Minnesota and Colorado.\nWe were partners in over $1.5 billion of awards by the Department of Energy to support the Heartland Hydrogen hub, while all fire and extreme weather resiliency, form energy long-duration energy storage pilots, and additional transmission as part of the MISO SPPC's projects. These grants will lower the cost of these clean energy and resiliency projects for our customers.\nIn 2023, we signed agreements for data centers with Meta in Minnesota and QTS in Colorado. Data center and AI-driven demand continued to be a low driver on our system with several gigawatts in the pipeline across our footprint.\nIn Minnesota, we received approvals for an additional 250 megawatts of solar in our 10-megawatt 100-hour Form Energy battery pilot both at our retiring Sherco coal facility.\nWe have active RFPs for over 2,000 megawatts of renewable resources across our operating companies, which we expect resolution on later this year. We also filed our resource plans in our SPS company, which could add an additional 5,000 to 10,000 megawatts to our system by 2030.\nIn December, we retired Unit 2 at our Sherco coal facility while continuing the trend of no personnel layoffs at our retiring coal facilities over the past 15 years. We reduced carbon emissions for the electric utility by 53% as compared to a 2005 baseline, on track with our goals for 2030 and 2050.\nAll the while, our customer bills remain amongst the lowest in the country. Over the past 5 years, the average Xcel Energy residential, electric and natural gas bills are 28% and 14% below the national average, respectively. And over the last 10 years, we kept our annual residential electric and natural gas bill increases to 1.8% and 1.1%, respectively, well below the rate of inflation.\nWe're actively involved in our communities. As our employees, contractors and retirees provided more than $11 million and volunteered over 40,000 hours to support charitable organizations across our footprint.\nWe initiated 18 economic development projects for our communities, which are projected to create more than $2.4 billion in capital investments and 1,400 jobs.\nFor the seventh consecutive year, we received the top score from Human Rights Campaign Foundation's Corporate Equality Index, the nation's foremost benchmarking survey measuring corporate policies and practices related to LGBTQ+ workplace equality.\nAnd finally, we received several other recognitions, including being named a top military employer by multiple organizations in one of the world's most admired companies by Fortune Magazine.\nWe're proud of these achievements, which reflect operational excellence and strong policy alignment, allowing Xcel Energy to provide a valuable product with significant benefits to our customers, our communities, our employees and our shareholders.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Brian.\n\nBrian J. Van Abel\n\nTreasurer & Vice President, Xcel Energy, Inc.\n\nThanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. For the full year 2023, we had ongoing earnings of $3.35 per share compared to $3.17 per share in 2022. The most significant earnings drivers for the year include the following: higher electric and natural gas margins, increased earnings by $0.10 per share. This reflects $0.10 of unfavorable weather as compared to last year.\nLower O&M expenses increased earnings by $0.06 per share which reflects the impact of cost containment actions. Lower conservation and DSM expense increased earnings by $0.06 per share, which is largely offset in lower margins.\nHigher other income increased earnings by $0.05 per share, primarily due to Rabi Trust performance, which is largely offset in O&M expenses.\nLower other taxes, primarily property taxes, increased earnings by $0.04 per share. And in addition, other items combined to increase earnings by $0.06 per share. Offsetting these positive drivers, higher interest charges, which decreased earnings by $0.14 per share driven by rising interest rates and increased debt levels to fund capital investment. And higher depreciation and amortization expense, which decreased earnings by $0.05 per share, reflecting our capital investment program.\nTurning to sales. Full year weather adjusted electric sales increased by 1%, consistent with our guidance assumptions. For 2024, we expect electric sales to increase by 2% to 3%.\nShifting to expenses. O&M expenses decreased $47 million or approximately 2% for the year. This is consistent with our annual guidance and reflects management action to offset inflation and other challenges we faced during the year.\nDuring the fourth quarter, we also made constructive progress on several rate case proceedings. In December, we filed a settlement in our Texas electric rate case, which reflects a rate increase of $65 million an acceleration of the top depreciation life to 2028 and the ROE of 9.55% and equity ratio of 54.5% for AFUDC purposes. The commission decision is anticipated in the first quarter of 2024.\nIn November, Wisconsin Commission approved an electric rate increase of $1 million and a natural gas increase of $5 million based on an ROE of 9.8% and an equity ratio of 52.5%. The decision reflects adjustments for our residential affordability program, updated fuel and purchase power costs and other items, which are earnings neutral. Rates were effective January 2024.\nIn November, we filed a Minnesota natural gas rate case requesting a $59 million rate increase based on an ROE of 10.2%, an equity ratio of 52.5% in the 4 test year. In December, the commission approved our request for interim rates of $51 million, subject to refund starting this January. Final decision is expected later this year.\nAs far as future filings, we plan to file a Colorado natural gas case in the next week or so. In addition, we also anticipate filing a revised wildfire mitigation plan in Colorado in the first half of 2024.\nUpdating our progress on production tax credit transferability. We executed multiple contracts in 2023 totaling $400 million. We anticipate executing $500 million of PPC sales in 2024. Transferability reduces near-term funding needs, and most importantly, lowers the cost of our renewable energy projects for our customers.\nMoving to our capital forecast. We've updated our 5-year capital plan for the decision in the Colorado resource plan, which now reflects an investment of $39 billion. This base capital plan supports investment in renewable generation, transmission to deliver the clean energy and customer-facing investments for a reliable and resilient advanced grid. The baseline results in an annual rate base growth of approximately 9%.\nNot included in our base plan is approximately $5 billion for renewables and firm capacity associated with RFPs at NSP and SPS and future filings in Colorado.\nWe've updated our base financing plan, which reflects the incremental debt and equity financing needs for these investments. Please note that the guidance assumptions in our earnings release have also been updated to reflect changes to the capital forecast for this year. As a reminder, we anticipate any incremental capital investment to be funded by approximately 40% equity.\nIt is important to recognize that we've always maintained a balanced financing strategy which includes a mix of debt and equity to fund accretive growth while maintaining a strong balance sheet and credit metrics.\nMaintaining solid credit metrics and favorable access to capital markets are critical to fund our clean energy transition maintain a competitive cost of capital and keep customer bills low, especially in a higher interest rate environment.\nFinally, we remain committed to our long-term EPS growth objective of 5% to 7%, which we believe is conservative. We now expect to deliver earnings at or above the top end of the range in 2025 -- starting in 2025.\nIn addition, we will rebase future annual guidance of actual results. As a result of the significant capital investment opportunities and equity funding needs, we now expect to grow the dividend at the low end of our current 5% to 7% dividend growth range with a target payout ratio of 50% to 60%. This will reduce our equity financing needs over time, lower financing risk and give us even more dry powder and financial flexibility in the future.\nNow I'll conclude with a brief update on the Marshall Law of our litigation. The statute of implementations ended in December, and as expected, we saw a significant increase in the number of claims. As of now, we are aware of 298 lawsuits with approximately 4,000 claims.\nIn early February, there will be a hearing at which time the schedule may be determined. We believe the trial will likely begin in 2025.\nWith that, I'll wrap up with a quick summary. We're executing on an ambitious investment plan for our customers to deliver clean, reliable energy. That investment enabled Xcel Energy to deliver 2023 ongoing earnings within our guidance range for the 19th year in a row. For the 20th consecutive year, we increased our dividend to investors.\nWe resolved multiple rate cases and foundational plans for our natural gas utility to reach its net zero goals. We retired our Sherco Unit 2 coal plant early and reduced carbon emissions by 53% from 2005 levels.\nWe received approval for our groundbreaking portfolio of clean energy resources in Colorado. We updated our base 5-year capital plan to $39 billion, which reflects 9% rate base growth. We have additional capital backlog in all of our jurisdictions.\nWe have a strong line of sight to achieving -- to achieve earnings at or above the top end of our 5% to 7% long-term EPS growth rate.\nAnd finally, our electric and natural gas customers have some of the lowest bills in the country while continuing the safe and reliable service they expect from Excel Energy.\nThis concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now take questions."

(Operator Instructions)\nI would now like to turn the call over to Matt Latino, Vice President of Investor Relations.\n\nMatthew Latino\n\nDirector of IR, Xylem Inc.\n\nThank you, Ashley. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Xylem's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2021 Earnings Conference Call. With me today are Chief Executive Officer, Patrick Decker; and Chief Financial Officer, Sandy Rowland. They will provide their perspective on Xylem's fourth quarter and full year 2021 results and discuss the first quarter and full year outlook for 2022. Following our prepared remarks, we will address questions related to the information covered on the call. I'll ask that you please keep to one question and a follow-up and then return to the queue.\nAs a reminder, this call and our webcast are accompanied by a slide presentation available in the Investors section of our website at www.xylem.com.\nA replay of today's call will be available until midnight on February 10.

We have provided you with a summary of our key performance metrics, including both GAAP and non-GAAP metrics in the appendix.\nFor purposes of today's call, all references will be on an adjusted basis, unless otherwise indicated and non-GAAP financials have been reconciled for you and are also included in the appendix section of the presentation.\nNow please turn to Slide 3, and I will turn the call over to our CEO, Patrick Decker.\n\nPatrick K. Decker\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Xylem Inc.\n\nThanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. As we indicated in our release this morning, the team delivered a strong operational performance in the fourth quarter, meeting or exceeding our expectations across all major metrics. Despite the challenges that 2021 presented us, especially in the second half, I'm very proud of the team for what they did to deliver on our commitments.\nAnd as a team, they delivered a very strong full year performance. This was reflected by mid-single-digit organic revenue growth, solid EBITDA margin expansion of 80 basis points and adjusted earnings per share growth of 21%. And orders grew 23% for the year and in the fourth quarter, giving us very strong momentum coming into 2022.\nWe posted our strongest orders growth in our M&CS segment. And it reflects the need and desire of our customers for digital solutions to address their growing needs around water affordability and infrastructure resilience.\nOur Water Infrastructure and Applied Water segment also posted very strong orders growth for the year and the fourth quarter, demonstrating the healthy demand across our portfolio. We continue to experience very strong underlying demand globally, with double-digit orders growth across all regions, and we expect that momentum to continue throughout 2022 and beyond. And our investments in R&D are clearly paying off, enabling us to win market share due to the customer value we're creating. And our investments in geographic coverage have made significant contributions to our overall growth, especially in emerging markets where we posted double-digit revenue growth in 2021. Of course, the other side of the story in 2021 was the constrained supply chain challenges of the second half, along with inflation that really accelerated in the last quarter.\nAs we anticipated in our last conference call, the severe chip shortage affecting the entire tech sector held back our ability to convert such strong orders into revenue, especially in our M&CS segment.\nAgainst that backdrop, the team did an excellent job managing what we can control, bringing discretionary costs down below 2020 levels, and taking aggressive pricing actions to mitigate inflationary pressures. In fact, price realization in the fourth quarter was modestly higher than our expectations and we expect to offset inflation further as we deliver accretive margins in our backlogs.\nSo despite all of the year's headwinds, the team not only delivered solid operational results, but they did it with heart and purpose.\nAlong the way, we made significant progress towards our 2025 signature sustainability goals. One example of that is that the team set a Xylem record for hours volunteered to solve water challenges in our communities around the world. It's a privilege to be a part of a team with that level of commitment to our mission.\nNow looking ahead to 2022, we see continued strong demand for our products and solutions strong fundamentals across our business in terms of productivity and free cash flow conversion and continued ability to drive price as a market leader to offset inflationary pressures.\nNevertheless, our outlook is tempered by the reality of a prolonged chip shortage, limiting the speed at which we can convert orders to revenue. So we are being balanced in our guidance based upon the visibility we have. Our guidance assumes modest and gradual increases in chip supply in the second half and into 2023.\nAnd as volumes return, we expect to realize significant margin expansion consistent with the first half of this past year when we operate in a less chip constrained environment in M&CS, and we see this in the backlog margins we have coming into 2022.\nIn the second half of this year, growth in margin expansion, both gross margin and EBITDA are expected to return to levels that put us on track to deliver on the 2025 strategic and financial framework that we outlined last September at our Investor Day. In a moment, we'll discuss the assumptions in our 2022 outlook and speak to our intentions for capital deployment, given the strength of our financial and competitive position.\nBut first, I'm going to hand it over to Sandy to dig in briefly on the quarter's results before we turn back to 2022.\n\nSandra E. Rowland\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Xylem Inc.\n\nThanks, Patrick. Please turn to Slide 4, and I'll cover our fourth quarter results. As Patrick indicated, significant chip shortages impacting the utilities end market in the U.S. more than offset utilities growth in Europe and strong growth in the industrial segment globally. Given the quarter's challenges, the team did an outstanding job delivering on our commitments and increasingly tough circumstances, with particularly strong performance on price, and discipline on costs.\nIn a moment, I'll give you a detailed performance by segment. But in short, utilities was down 9%, a result of supply chain constraints acutely impacting our smart metering business in the U.S. Industrial grew 7% on sustained strength in China and healtivity in the U.S. Commercial was up modestly at 1% and residential was down 4% on challenging comparisons in the prior year when we grew mid-teens.\nOrganic orders were up 23% in the quarter as demand for our technologies continues to be healthy across all segments. EBITDA margin was 16.2%, which was within our guided range. Year-over-year EBITDA margin contracted 260 basis points as productivity savings and strong price realization benefits were more than offset by inflation, mix and strategic investments.\nWe continue to invest, for example, in geographic market coverage to serve increasing demand and enhanced digital capabilities across the portfolio. Our EPS in the quarter was $0.63. And please turn to Slide 5, and I'll review the quarter's segment performance in a bit more detail. Water Infrastructure orders in the fourth quarter were up 30% organically versus last year. That includes a project cancellation last year in India, which we discussed on a previous call. Otherwise, orders were up mid-single digits.\nThis order's pace reflects resilient demand in our wastewater utility business in the U.S. and Europe as well as increasing demand for dewatering, particularly in emerging markets. Water Infrastructure revenue was up modestly in the quarter. Healthy growth in Industrial was partly offset by a small decline in our wastewater utility business in the U.S. where order to revenue conversion was challenged by long ocean transit times.\nGeographically, results were mixed for the segment. The U.S. and Western Europe were up low single digits and mid-single digits, respectively. Healthy treatment deliveries in both geographies were offset by the delays I just mentioned.\nEmerging markets was down low single digits, largely due to an especially strong performance in China last year. EBITDA margin for the segment was down 50 basis points as significant savings from productivity and cost reductions were offset by inflation and strategic investments.\nPlease turn to Page 6. In the Applied Water segment, orders were up 10% organically in the quarter, driven by healthy demand in all geographies. Revenues increased 3% with high single-digit growth in Industrial and a modest increase in commercial, partially offset by sales down mid-single digits in residential.\nGeographically, the U.S. was up high single digits. Growth in all end markets was led by ongoing industrial recovery. Emerging markets was up mid-single digits on continuing industrial strength in China and momentum in Eastern Europe. Western Europe delivered low single-digit growth with moderate gains balanced across all end markets.\nSegment EBITDA margin declined 340 basis points in the quarter. Material and freight inflation more than offset solid productivity gains and accelerating price realization.\nAnd now let's turn to Slide 7, and I'll cover our Measurement & Control Solutions business. M&CS orders grew 28% organically in the quarter, reflecting strong demand for our metrology solutions as well as healthy demand across all other applications in this segment, including test and pipeline assessment services. This puts our M&CS backlog up 63% versus the prior year.\nAs we anticipated, revenue declined 17% due to constrained chip supply. It's worth noting that the growing metrology backlog is both resilient and margin accretive. There have been no cancellations of AMI contracts and we expect large project deployments will resume in the back half of the year as component supply becomes available.\nGeographically, U.S. revenues were down 21%. Western Europe and emerging markets declined more modestly at 10% and 2%, respectively, from pockets of growth in our water quality test business.\nSegment EBITDA margin in the quarter was down 750 basis points. Volume was the biggest factor as this business gets very strong operating leverage from higher revenues, which were constrained by the lower conversion of orders. Those volume effects, along with higher inflation were partially offset by productivity gains and cost discipline.\nAnd now let's turn to Slide 8 for an overview of cash flows and the company's financial position. Our financial position remains robust as we exit the year with $1.3 billion in cash and available liquidity of more than $2 billion. Net debt-to-EBITDA leverage is 1.2x.\nAfter delivering free cash flow conversion of 181% last year, our free cash flow conversion was 77% in 2021, slightly below our target for the year. While our team made continued progress driving collections, we consciously increased our inventory safety stocks in the second half of the year to mitigate supply chain volatility but we remain committed to at least 100% conversion over the cycle.\nA further item of note. As we previously advised, we are derisking our balance sheet with the buyout of our largest defined pension plan in the U.K. We expect to finalize this transfer in 2022 at which point we'll recognize a noncash charge of approximately $150 million, primarily consisting of unrecognized actuarial losses, which are reflected in equity today.\nLastly, in line with our capital allocation framework. Today, we announced an increase in our annual dividend of 7%, and that is our 11th consecutive annual increase. Please turn to Slide 9, and I'll hand back to Patrick to look forward at 2022.\n\nPatrick K. Decker\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Xylem Inc.\n\nThanks, Andy. We see strong demand continuing through 2022. And strong fundamentals in all our businesses. On the other hand, the reality is that supply constraints will continue to be an important and not entirely predictable variable. So we are reflecting a responsible set of assumptions in our guidance while working aggressively to improve the situation. We anticipate chip availability will improve for the year, but not linearly and not all at once.\nIn the first half, shortages are still likely to hold back conversion of orders to revenue with disproportionate impact on our higher-margin solutions. So we'll be focused on operating with discipline, driving price, productivity and cost during what we foresee being a transitory period.\nIn the second half of the year, supply should begin to improve modestly, and the pace of chip shipments will have a determining effect on our growth rate and margin expansion.\nAs components begin to come through, the margin upside is highly accretive to our margin profile. The positive side of this dynamic was apparent in the first half of 2021 when chip supply did not limit M&CS growth, and we saw margin expansion of more than 500 points in the portfolio.\nGiven the size and growth of our metrology backlogs, it's worth expanding on a point Sandy made a moment ago about the resilience of those backlogs. Large AMI projects are not easily substituted and they offer a compelling business case for our customers, particularly as they are addressing issues of affordability and regulatory commitments. Our utility customers often spend years in pilot testing, approval and procurement to determine these solutions.\nSo despite these near-term delays, we do not anticipate backlog erosion.\nTurning to Slide 10. You can see our focus areas for 2022, which will keep us aligned to our long-term financial framework. The team is managing through the current challenges with great discipline, working with both suppliers and customers. Even though we expect chip supply will gradually improve in the second half, we don't anticipate suppliers will be able to serve 100% of our requirements given the sheer size of our order books. So we're working with our most critical supply partner to accelerate redesign options, and we're staying close to our customers to prioritize serving their most mission-critical needs.\nSince visibility about the likely rate of improvement is imperfect we're also phasing our ongoing strategic investments with an eye on leading indicators of supply recovery.\nNow before I turn to Sandy for more detail on our outlook, I want to comment briefly on capital deployment. We're coming into the year with a strong balance sheet and more than $2 billion in liquidity. So M&A naturally comes to mind as a strategic accelerator for sustained growth and margin expansion.\nAnd those of you who've been with us a while, you know that we're not hesitant to do a deal when there's a good deal to be done in service of advancing the company's overall strategy. And our view is that there are opportunities for strategic value creation in the marketplace for a company like us with our financial strength and sector leadership. But we will continue to be disciplined and selective with an eye towards significant value creation.\nNow I'll turn it back over to Sandy for more on our outlook.\n\nSandra E. Rowland\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Xylem Inc.\n\nThanks, Patrick. We expect underlying demand will continue to be healthy through 2022. However, as Patrick just described, business conditions aren't likely to normalize on an entirely predictable path. So we've taken a view of the year that reflects those dynamics, balancing external constraints and potential upside. We anticipate our utility business overall, which is just north of 50% of Xylem revenues will grow low single digits in 2022.\nOn the wastewater side, we expect low single-digit to mid-single-digit growth as we see a continuation of resilient global demand. We anticipate strong demand in emerging markets driven by considerable investment in public utilities, increasing OpEx activity as well as the benefit of our localization strategy.\nThe outlook for longer-term capital project spending and bid activity is very solid globally. On the clean water side, we anticipate revenues will be flat. Demand remains robust, but deliveries will be constrained by chip shortages mentioned earlier. We foresee healthy momentum in our test and assessment services businesses due to increased focus on infrastructure and climate challenges.\nAnd now please turn to Slide 12. Looking at the industrial end market, we expect to grow mid-single digits on steady demand for our solutions globally. We continue to see healthy growth in dewatering especially in emerging markets from increasing mining demand and benefiting from our localization strategies.\nIn the U.S. and Western Europe, we expect solid order rates and backlog expansion as activity ramps in light industrial applications.\nThe commercial end market should deliver mid-single-digit growth on solid replacement business in the U.S. as well as acceleration of institutional construction.\nIn Europe, we see increased construction activity driven by the rise in funding for green buildings, driving demand for our new eco-friendly product offerings in that space.\nIn residential, our smallest end market, we are expecting low single-digit to mid-single-digit growth with healthy demand.\nAnd now let's turn to Slide 13, and I'll walk you through our updated guidance. For Xylem overall, we foresee full year 2022 organic revenue growth in the range of 3% to 5%, with flat revenues in the first half and high single-digit growth in the second half. This breaks down by segment as follows: Mid-single-digit growth in water infrastructure with solid growth in both wastewater utilities and industrial. Mid-single-digit growth in Applied Water from solid mid-single-digit growth in industrial and commercial applications and low to mid-single-digit growth in residential.\nWe expect Measurement & Control Solutions to be flattish. As Patrick mentioned earlier, this assumes down double digits in this half of the year and up double digits in the second half. Although growth is still likely to be partially constrained by the gradual return of chip supply as the second half progresses.\nDespite that partial recoverability and the availability of chips, volumes and margins will remain supply constrained. The constraint will have an unfavorable impact on volume and mix, more than offsetting the benefits of price realization and productivity savings through the year.\nFor 2022, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of 16% to 17%. In the first half of the year, we anticipate EBITDA will be approximately 14% to 15% and bouncing back to 18% to 19% in the second half. And this puts EBITDA in the second half in line with the long-term targets we laid out at Investor Day.\nThis yields an adjusted EPS range of $2.35 to $2.70. Free cash flow conversion is expected to be at least 100% of net income. We have provided you with other full year assumptions on this slide to supplement your models.\nWe're assuming a euro to dollar conversion rate of 1.13 and as foreign exchange can be volatile, FX sensitivity table is included in the appendix.\nAnd now drilling down in the first quarter, we anticipate total company organic revenues will be in the range of flat to up 2%. This includes mid-single-digit growth in Water Infrastructure and Applied Water and M&CS is expected to decline low double digits.\nWe expect first quarter adjusted EBITDA margin to be in the range of 13.5% to 14%, impacted by higher inflation and supply chain challenges. We expect this will be the low point in adjusted EBITDA in the year with accelerating sequential quarterly improvement.\nAnd with that, please turn to Slide 14, and I'll turn the call back over to Patrick for closing comments.\n\nPatrick K. Decker\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Xylem Inc.\n\nThanks, Sandy. We're coming into 2022 in a strong and enviable position. The market demand for our solutions and technologies has never been greater. We have strong commercial momentum with very strong orders growth and high-margin backlogs that prove our conviction about the investments we've been making and our customers need and appetite and the foundation and flexibility of a powerful balance sheet, giving us strategic options in a dynamic marketplace.\nIn the short term, of course, no one likes being constrained by externalities. But we have strong resolve and operating discipline and fully expect to deliver a year of results on track with our 2025 strategic and financial goals and that are aligned to our overall investment thesis, that being a technology leader with a durable business model, bringing differentiated offerings to a market of rising demand for sustainable water solutions, committed to driving above-market growth and margin expansion as our portfolio continues to digitize and to accelerating value creation with disciplined active capital allocation.\nSo now operator, I'll turn the call over to you for questions."

[Operator Instructions] I would like to now turn the call over to Andrea van der Berg, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nAndrea van der Berg\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Xylem's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. With me today are Chief Executive Officer, Patrick Decker; Chief Operating Officer, Matthew Pine; Senior Adviser and former Chief Financial Officer, Sandy Rowland; and Chief Financial Officer, Bill Grogan. Bill will provide their perspective on Xylem's third quarter 2023 results and discuss the fourth quarter and full year outlook.\nFollowing our prepared remarks, we will address questions related to the information covered on the call. I'll ask you please keep to one question and a follow-up and then return to the queue.\nAs a reminder, this call and our webcast are accompanied by a slide presentation available in the Investors section of our website. A replay of today's call will be available until midnight, November 7. Additionally, the call will be available for playback via the Investors section of our website under the heading Investor Events. Please turn to Slide 2.\nWe will make some forward-looking statements on today's call, including references to future events or developments that we anticipate will or may occur in the future. These statements are subject to future risks and uncertainties such as those factors described in Xylem's most recent annual report on Form 10-K and in subsequent reports filed with the SEC. Please note that the company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements publicly to reflect subsequent events or circumstances, and actual events or results could differ materially from those anticipated. Please turn to Slide 3.\nWe've provided you with a summary of our key performance metrics, including both GAAP and non-GAAP metrics. For purposes of today's call, all references will be on an organic and/or adjusted basis, unless otherwise indicated, and non-GAAP financials have been reconciled for you and are included in the Appendix section of the presentation.\nNow please turn to Slide 4, and I'll turn the call over to our CEO, Patrick Decker.\n\nPatrick K. Decker\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Xylem, Inc.\n\nThanks, Andrea. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. By now, you'll see that our first full quarter as a combined company with Xylem and Evoqua together. The team delivered very strong performance across each of our segments. We significantly exceeded expectations on organic revenue growth, EBITDA margin and earnings per share. And revenue grew 10% organically. We expanded EBITDA margin well above prior year, and we delivered EPS of $0.99 for the quarter, which represents 14% growth year-over-year. Orders were up 3% and more importantly, our backlogs continue to grow, especially in our M&CS and ISS segments. Total backlog is now $5.2 billion. And this sets us up for continued growth momentum and demonstrates the health of our key end markets. So on the strength of this performance, we are raising our full year guidance.\nI want to personally give a big shout out to the team for their strong operational performance during a period of integrating 2 large enterprises. Instead of getting distracted, the team continued to focus on serving our customers and delivering on our commitments. The integration of Evoqua is well on track to deliver the cost synergies we promised. It's those synergies that underwrote the transaction. But more importantly, it's the growth synergies that excite us the most. And our customers have already begun to experience the advantages of our combined capabilities.\nOverall, the quarter's strong result, it reflects our continued momentum, and that puts me in a very privileged position on my last earnings call as CEO of Xylem. In September, we announced a planned succession of both me as CEO and Sandy as CFO. Matthew Pine is going to lead Xylem as CEO beginning January 1. I'll remain on as an adviser through the end of March. I'd also like to formally welcome our new CFO, Bill Grogan, who is on the call with us today. He's alongside Sandy Rowland. Bill took on the role of CFO on October 1, and it's been a real pleasure to welcome him to the team. Now as Sandy was in the chair through beginning of September, she is going to cover the third quarter results. But that's not going to happen before I take the opportunity to thank her for her many significant contributions to Xylem. She's been a great partner and a great leader over the last few years with me and the team we simply would not be where we are today without her many contributions.\nSo now over to you, Sandy.\n\nSandra E. Rowland\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Xylem Inc.\n\nThank you, Patrick. Before I go over the quarter's performance, I'd like to take a moment to congratulate Bill. In the short time since he stepped into the CFO role, I've been impressed with how quickly he has immersed himself in the business and taken on financial leadership of the company. Like Patrick, I will continue to stay on this as an adviser through March to ensure a smooth transition, but the company will be in great hands with Bill working alongside Matthew next year, and I couldn't be more confident in Xylem's future. And now let's look at the quarter. Please turn to Slide 5.\nAs Patrick mentioned, the team has continued to deliver strong performance in Q3, exceeding expectations on growth margin expansion and earnings per share. Each segment outperformed, including integrated solutions and services. As a reminder, since the combination with Evoqua, we began including ISS as our fourth reporting segment. For Xylem overall, total revenues grew 50%, while organic revenue rose 10%, led by particularly robust double-digit growth in the U.S. Western Europe grew a healthy 6% and emerging markets was down largely due to China despite strength in other parts of Asia and all [indiscernible] in Africa. From an end market perspective, utilities grew 16%, mainly driven by robust demand and price realization in both M&CS and water infrastructure. Industrial grew 5%, driven by strong demand in the U.S. and healthy demand in Western Europe. Lastly, Building Solutions grew 3%, with strength in developed markets, more than offsetting moderation in emerging markets.\nOverall, demand remains resilient. Our backlog is now $5.2 billion, up 5% organically, and this includes a $1.3 billion contribution from Evoqua. Orders were up 3% in the quarter, and book-to-bill for the company was approximately 1. EBITDA margin was 19.8%, up 150 basis points from the prior year on higher volumes, productivity savings and favorable price cost dynamics. Our EPS in the quarter was $0.99, up 14% year-over-year. Please turn to Slide 6, and I'll review each segment's third quarter performance in a bit more detail.\nM&CS revenue was up 25%, driven primarily by improved chip supply and backlog execution as well as strength in test and measurement. All regions saw double-digit growth led by an impressive 31% in the U.S. Orders were down in the quarter due to the timing of metrology orders, while Assessment Services saw strong growth. Year-to-date, book-to-bill remains above 1 for this segment. Our M&C backlog of $2.3 billion is up 11% organically versus the prior year a reflection of strong continuing demand for our AMI offerings and the accelerating trend towards digitization. EBITDA margin for the segment was up 190 basis points versus the prior year, driven by volume conversion price realization and productivity, more than offsetting inflation. And now let's turn to Slide 7, and I'll cover our Water Infrastructure business.\nWater Infrastructure outperformed due to stronger-than-expected price realization and backlog execution with reported growth of 40% and organic growth of 7%. As a reminder, we have integrated Evoqua's applied products technology business into the Water Infrastructure segment, further building out our treatment portfolio. This business outperformed expectations driven by stronger backlog execution. For both utilities and industrials, the U.S. saw robust growth, while Western Europe proved resilient, offsetting some weakness in emerging markets. Organic orders in the quarter were up 14% year-over-year, and each region saw double-digit growth, with particular strength in developed markets. EBITDA margin for the segment was up 50 basis points and 80 basis points when excluding the contribution of Evoqua. Please turn to Slide 8 for an overview of Applied Water.\nApplied Water revenues grew 1% on continued backlog execution, modestly better than expectations of flat revenue growth. Growth in Building Solutions was driven by continued strength in commercial, particularly in the U.S. While Industrial was down modestly, there was resilient growth in developed markets, offset by moderation in emerging markets. Orders were up 2% in the quarter on strength in the U.S. and segment EBITDA margin expanded 20 basis points with continued strong price cost dynamics and productivity more than offsetting volume declines. Please turn to Slide 9.\nLast quarter, we introduced Integrated Solutions and Services as our fourth segment. ISS brings a durable recurring news from businesses, including outsourced water, which provide outcome-based treatment services to customers. In its first full quarter with Xylem, ISS revenue exceeded our expectations as implied in our reported guidance. On a pro forma basis, ISS revenue grew 10% year-over-year driven by strong price realization and backlog execution. Orders grew on a pro forma basis by 12% year-over-year with broad-based demand across industrials and utilities. Book-to-bill was greater than 1 and backlog exceeded $1 billion to end the quarter, up 14% year-over-year on a pro forma basis. Adjusted EBITDA margin was strong at 22.6%, driven by price realization and productivity. And now let's turn to Slide 10 for an overview of cash flows and the company's financial position.\nOur position remains robust as we exit the quarter with over $700 million in cash and available liquidity of $1.7 billion. Net debt-to-EBITDA leverage is 1.2x and year-to-date, we had adjusted free cash flow conversion of 94%. Please turn to Slide 11, and I'll hand it back over to Patrick.\n\nPatrick K. Decker\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Xylem, Inc.\n\nThanks, Sandy. Today is the 12th anniversary of Xylem's listing on the New York Stock Exchange. And I think it's pretty fair to say that 12 years ago, water wasn't very widely recognized as an investable thesis. But since then, intensifying secular trends have made absolutely clear the value of a platform of solutions to meet the global order challenges. In that time, Xylem has evolved in our composition, our scale and our impact, but our investment thesis has remained constant.\nIt's one that's focused on a multiyear runway of attractive organic growth with sustainable margin expansion, and strong free cash flow conversion. And it's that financial strength and confidence that allows us to effectively deploy capital as we continue building a differentiated market-leading water solutions platform. Under that thesis, we built a very durable business model and Xylem colleagues and partners around the world are creating significant economic and social value as we serve our customers and communities around the world. I am both proud of what we built for, but also excited to see what Xylem is capable of becoming under Matthew's leadership.\nMatthew and I have worked side-by-side for the past 3.5 years. So this handover is progressing very smoothly. And I have total confidence he will lead this team to realize the full promise of our strategy and created an even greater impact in value in the years to come. So now over to you, Matthew.\n\nMatthew Francis Pine\n\nSVP and President of Applied Water Systems & Americas Commercial Team, Xylem Inc.\n\nThank you, Patrick. I am grateful and energized the prospect of building on Xylem's momentum in creating our next phase of growth and impact. I'm also deeply grateful for Patrick's passionate visionary leadership. His legacy is Xylem's bright future, having put Xylem firmly on a path of continuing profitable growth. The strength of our partnership is making it easy to deliver the continuity essential to all stakeholders in this handover as we approach the turn of the year. And as Patrick said, our thesis is constant, our strategy is sound, and we are committed to our long-range plan, as team is solving customers' greatest water challenges with the most advanced platform of solutions in the world. A fragmented complex market, that integrated offering is a distinctive competitive advantage. The opportunity ahead of us is to make it easier for even more customers to access the full range of capabilities they need to solve their most critical water challenges.\nIn the process, we'll grow our penetration, our profitability, our durability and our impact. The team and I look forward sharing more color about the next phase of our growth at an Investor Day in May next year. We'll provide a further update on our combined company opportunity and long-range plan then. In the meantime, I'm pleased to share our near-term outlook I'll provide a brief update on our Evoqua integration and then a picture of what we expect in our end markets over the next period. And then finally, I'll ask Bill to provide guidance for the remainder of the year. Moving to Slide 12.\nAs you can see, the integration of Evoqua has gained quick momentum, and the team has come together remarkably fast. There's great collaboration, and we have the benefit of bringing 2 highly complemented cultures with assembly-strong sense of purpose together. We committed $140 million of cost synergies within 3 years as well as exiting 2023 with a [ $40 million ] run rate. And as Patrick mentioned, that's well on track. But the rationale for the combination has always been about growth. the opportunity to create more value serving customers with our combined capabilities. In utilities, we'll deepen our penetration, especially with the addition of Evoqua's applied product technology offerings through our Water Infrastructure segment. The combination allows us to provide even more comprehensive treatment solutions in both clean water and wastewater.\nIn Industrial, we will scale our presence in attractive verticals with services offerings of ISS. We see long-term market expansion in growing verticals such as microelectronics, power, life sciences and food and beverage. And geographically, we will scale Evoqua's products and solutions internationally, including the service business by leveraging Xylem's global distribution platform. Both Xylem and Evoqua were market leaders on their own. But together, we're in even a stronger position. We are already seeing the benefits of scale, reach and integrated offerings and a robust pipeline of global opportunities as well as the combined wins both teams are posting.\nAnd as we integrate our 2 businesses even more deeply, we'll take advantage of the opportunity to optimize our portfolio for growth. That will include structuring our offerings in ways that are matched to how our end markets address water management. The job is to make it even simpler for them to access solutions they need and we're already hearing how customers appreciate having fewer vendors to coordinate across multiple domains. Now let's turn to Slide 13, and I'll cover the outlook for our end markets.\nOur outperformance in the first three quarters of the year provides great momentum to build on. I especially want to echo Patrick shout out to all of our teams for delivering such a standout performance this year and in the third quarter. It's that kind of commitment and discipline that demonstrates the team's ability to execute through a dynamic macroeconomic environment. That said, we continue to take a balanced outlook and are monitoring signs of softness on a regional level particularly in China and some end markets addressed by our Applied Water segment.\nAs a reminder, our 2023 outlook is expressed on an organic basis. At a high level, we anticipate that utilities demand will continue to be resilient and industrial demand will provide steady growth. Utilities compromise approximately 45% of revenue, they continue to show healthy demand, and we continue to expect growth of mid-teens. On the clean water side, we continue to see robust demand for our AMI solutions. On top of that, we're driving backlog execution on improved chip supply, and we're seeing even more traction on solution selling with our digital platform as customers increasingly value bundled offerings. We now anticipate growth of mid-20s, up from low 20s previously. On the wastewater side, OpEx is expected to remain resilient in developed markets alongside steady CapEx spend across regions, underpinning demand. We expect to see high single-digit growth in wastewater overall.\nTurning to industrial end market, which is about 45% of our revenue, we now expect global growth of high single digits, up from mid-single digits. Developed markets continue to be resilient, although there are pockets of moderation in emerging markets. Lastly, in Building Solutions, which is about 10% of our revenue, we continue to expect growth of mid-single digits, driven by steady replacement business, particularly in commercial applications. Overall, the demand outlook continues to be positive despite some variability in macro indicators. While the organic view does not include Evoqua, the demand profile in ISS is resilient on the foundation of recurring revenues further increasing the durability of our business.\nNow I have the pleasure of turning the call over to Bill for the first time to walk through our Q4 guidance.\n\nWilliam K. Grogan\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, IDEX Corp.\n\nThanks, Matthew, and thanks Patrick and Sandy, for your kind words. I'm incredibly grateful to Sandy for being so generous for their insight about the business during this handover. She has built a strong team and culture, and I wish her well in her new endeavors. I want to start by saying how excited I am to join the Xylem team. I've long admired the company, both because of its rise to sector leadership and also because of its distinctive commitment to both social and economic value creation. And now a month in, I'm even more compelled by the opportunities ahead of us. It is a privilege to be part of the team that will take Xylem forward, building on this extraordinary platform and performance.\nAs Patrick mentioned, we are increasing our full year revenue, EBITDA margin and EPS guidance. Full year revenue will now be approximately $7.3 billion. This translates to total revenue growth of about [ 32% ] and organic revenue growth of about 11%, up from 9% to 10% previously. We are raising EBITDA margin of approximately 19%, up from 18%, driven by higher volume, stronger price realization and productivity initiatives. This reflects about 200 basis points of margin expansion versus the prior year. In addition, we are lifting full year adjusted EPS guidance to $3.71 to $3.73, up from $3.60 at the midpoint. The revised guidance breaks down by segment as follows: low 20s growth in M&CS, up from approximately 20% previously, high single-digit growth in water infrastructure and mid-single-digit growth in Applied Water. And we remain committed to achieving free cash flow conversion of above 100% of net income. We have also provided you with a number of full year assumptions in the appendix on Slide 19.\nAnd now drilling down in the fourth quarter. We anticipate total revenue growth will be in the 35% to 36% range on a reported basis and [ 4% to 5% ] organically. By segment, we expect revenue growth to be mid-teens in M&CS, low single digits in water infrastructure and remained flat in Applied Water. We expect fourth quarter EBITDA margin to be approximately 19.5% driven by higher volumes, continued price realization and productivity gains. This yields fourth quarter EPS of $0.94 to $0.96. Our operational discipline, commercial momentum and backlog strength give us confidence in the remainder of the year and delivering our long-term plan.\nWith that, please turn to Slide 15, and I'll turn the call back over to Patrick for closing comments.\n\nPatrick K. Decker\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Xylem, Inc.\n\nThanks, Bill, and thank you, Matthew and Sandy. This is a bittersweet moment for me. I'm wrapping up my last earnings call with Xylem. Leading in helping build this enterprise has been absolutely the greatest privilege of my career. I'm so proud of what the team has achieved in the past 10 years. Of the work that we've done alongside our partners, serving our customers and communities and of the value we've created together. That said, it's clear to me personally, we are only just beginning to realize our full potential. Xylem is strongly positioned, our momentum is accelerating and there has never been a greater need for solutions to the world's water challenges. It's incredibly gratifying to note that me, that my more than 22,000 Xylem colleagues and our partners are going to take the work of solving water forward under an exceptionally strong leadership team. We are poised to have an even greater impact and to create even more value in the many years to come.\nOn a final personal note to the many of you whose jobs include closely tracking and analyzing our business, I've come to know you quite well as you followed Xylem's growth. I admire and respect the work that you do, all the very best to each of you and simply go keep making a difference.\nNow, we're going to take your questions. And so operator, let's open it up for Q&A."

[Operator Instructions] Please note that this event is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Andrea van der Berg, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nAndrea van der Berg\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Xylem's second quarter 2024 earnings call.\nWith me today are Chief Executive Officer, Matthew Pine; and Chief Financial Officer, Bill Grogan. They will provide their perspective on Xylem's second quarter 2024 results and discuss the third quarter and full year outlook. Following our prepared remarks, we will address questions related to the information covered on the call. Please keep to 1 question and a follow-up and then return to the queue. As a reminder, this call and our webcast are accompanied by a slide presentation available in the Investor section of our website. A replay of today's call will be available until midnight, August 6th. Additionally, the call will be available for playback via the Investors section of our website under the heading Investor Events.\nPlease turn to Slide 2. We will make some forward-looking statements on today's call, including references to future events or developments that we anticipate will or may occur in the future. These statements are subject to future risks and uncertainties, such as those factors described in Xylem's most recent annual report on Form 10-K and in subsequent reports filed with the SEC. Please note that the company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements publicly to reflect subsequent events or circumstances, and actual events or results could differ materially from those anticipated.\nPlease turn to Slide 3. We've provided you with a summary of our key performance metrics, including both GAAP and non-GAAP metrics with references to segment metrics being made on a comparative basis, reflecting the changes in the second quarter and full-year outlook. Following the prepared remarks, all references will be on an organic and/or adjusted basis, unless otherwise indicated, and non-GAAP financials have been reconciled for you and are included in the Appendix section of the presentation.\nPlease turn to Slide 4, and we'll turn the call over to our CEO, Matthew Pine.\n\nMatthew Francis Pine\n\nSVP and President of Applied Water Systems & Americas Commercial Team, Xylem Inc.\n\nThanks, Andrew. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today.\nIt's a pleasure to report the achievements of the Xylem team in the second quarter. In this morning's release, the team delivered another very strong quarter, outperforming expectations on all metrics, with high single-digit organic revenue growth, reflecting gains in both volume and price. The team also expanded adjusted EBITDA margin 170 basis points. And without outperformance, we delivered adjusted EPS growth of 11%. The story of the second quarter is similar to Q1. On the demand side, our largest markets continue to be resilient. Internally, our outperformance is driven by increasingly disciplined operational execution by the team. This kind of performance momentum is only possible when the whole team is engaged and aligned to make a difference. And I want to say a big thank you to the whole Xylem's team for the dedication and drive they've demonstrated through the first half of the year. While there were a lot of highlights across the team, I particularly want to mention the standout performance and measurement and control solutions. MCS segment revenue was up 26% and EBITDA margins are up 700 basis points versus this time last year. The team is doing an outstanding job. Our first half performance is a reflection of the value creation duration we set early in the year and discussed at Xylem's Investor Day in May. That direction includes both resilient above-market growth and accelerated margin expansion. It's gratifying to see the kind of momentum reflected in our quarterly performance. In addition, our simplification initiatives and our work on 80/20 are progressing well and are set to pay off beginning in 2025.\nTurning to the integration of Evoqua in late May, we passed the 1-year anniversary of our combination with Evoqua. The combination continues to reveal its value. Cost synergies are well on track and the team is looking to accelerate our pace wherever possible. And our commercial teams are successfully taking Xylem's combined capabilities to the many customers who will benefit from our integrated solutions, both in utility and industrial end markets. With Evoqua integration on track, strong momentum from the first half, resilient demand and the team's increasing operational commercial discipline, we're raising our full year guide for both revenue and margin increasing our EPS guidance $0.06 from the prior midpoint.\nIn a moment, I'll provide an update on our high-impact culture and our leadership alignment and also on our industry-leading 2030 sustainability goals. But first, I'm going to turn it over to Bill to double-click on the quarter's results, our financial position and our outlook. Bill?\n\nWilliam K. Grogan\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, IDEX Corp.\n\nThanks, Matthew.\nPlease turn to Slide 5. Q2 was another great quarter, and I want to thank our entire organization for their amazing work. We outperformed against our guide across revenue, margin and earnings per share. We continue to see resilient demand and our backlog is at $5.2 billion, a modest decline from prior year as we execute on MCS pass-through backlog book-to-bill was approximately 1, supported by strength in water infrastructure, while organic orders were down 1% in the quarter, driven by project timing within MCS and WSS.\nTotal revenues grew 26% and organic revenue rose 9%, exceeding our guidance on a healthy combination of volume and price. Our performance was led by MCS and WSS as we saw growth in all regions led by double-digit growth in the U.S.\nEBITDA margin was 20.8%, up 170 basis points from the prior year. With productivity savings, strong volume and price more than offsetting inflation, investments in mix. This reflects incrementals of 28% on a consolidated basis and 50% on a pro forma basis. Our EPS in the quarter was $1.09, above the high end of our guidance by $0.04 and up 11% over the prior year. Our balance sheet is strong with net debt to adjusted EBITDA at 0.7x. Year-to-date, free cash flow was up 200% versus the prior year and conversion of 62% is strong given seasonality. This year-over-year improvement was driven by higher net income, offset slightly by increased CapEx, and we continue to benefit from improved working capital efficiency.\nPlease turn to Slide 6. Measurement & Control Solutions had another great quarter and again exceeded our expectations. MCS revenue was up 26%, driven by smart metering demand and backlog execution. However, due to project timing, orders were down 18% and book-to-bill came in under 1. We worked down past due backlog and total backlog for MCS now sits at roughly $2 billion, a 12% organic decrease from prior year. We finished the quarter with impressive EBITDA margins of 23.4%, up 700 basis points versus the prior year and up 70 bps sequentially.\nMargin expansion was driven by volume, price, productivity and favorable mix more than offsetting inflation. As a reminder, we continue to expect a margin headwind from mix in the second half as energy meters account for a larger portion of our sales.\nIn Water Infrastructure, orders were up strong 8% in the quarter, led by robust treatment demand. Revenue exceeded our expectations with total growth of 22% and organic growth of 7%, driven by healthy demand across all regions and applications. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the segment was down 60 basis points, with roughly 40% pro forma incrementals. This decline was driven by inflation and acquisition, but was offset partially by productivity, volume and price. Without the impact of acquisitions, adjusted EBITDA margin improved 40 basis points for the quarter.\nIn Applied Water, orders were up 5% and book-to-bill was greater than 1, reflective of a few large project wins, which will ship next year. Revenues were down 4%, in line with our expectations, lapping strong comps on 12% growth in the second quarter of last year. The decline was primarily driven by softness in developed markets. Segment EBITDA margins declined 200 basis points year-over-year, but increased 100 basis points sequentially. Higher inflation and unfavorable mix was partially offset by productivity savings.\nClosing the segments with Water Solutions and Services. Orders declined 1% organically, driven by timing of large capital projects offset by strength in dewatering. Organic revenue was up 12% with healthy growth across most of the business. Adjusted EBITDA margin was strong at 23.8%, up 60 basis points and driven by volume, productivity and price, offset in part by unfavorable mix and inflation.\nTwo quarters in the resegmentation, we continue to see synergy momentum and benefits for our customers in combining our service-based offerings.\nNow let's turn to Slide 7 for our updated full year and Q3 guidance. Given our first half outperformance in both commercial and operational momentum, we are raising our full year guide. We are increasing our revenue guide by approximately $50 million, up from $8.5 billion. This reflects an additional 0.5 point of growth at the midpoint versus our prior guidance. That will put total revenue growth at approximately 16% and organic revenue growth at 5% to 6%. The integration is going smoothly, and we continue to expect $100 million of exit run rate cost synergies in 2024 with the potential to accelerate by year-end. We are confident about driving further margin expansion with operational productivity and are raising our EBITDA margin guidance to about 20.5%, that represents 160 basis points of expansion versus the prior year, driven by higher volume, productivity, including cost synergies and price offsetting inflation. Our updated EPS guidance of $4.18 to $4.28 reflects an increase of $0.06 at the midpoint. Free cash flow conversion for the year is now expected to be over 120% of net income. The full year outlook at the segment level remains largely unchanged with the exception of MCS, which we now expect to grow at high teens due to our first half performance versus our previous outlook of low teens.\nFor the quarter, we anticipate revenue growth will be 3% to 5% on a reported and organic basis. We expect third quarter EBITDA margin to be in the range of 20.5% to 21%, up 70 to 120 basis points, driven by higher volumes, continued price realization and productivity gains. This yields third quarter EPS of $1.07 to $1.12.\nOur diversified portfolio of mission-critical products and services positions us well to address our customers' evolving needs, and we anticipate healthy demand across most end markets and applications. And we talked about our driving profitability through simplification efforts and our 80/20 implementations at the Investor Day in May. We are progressing well on those initiatives, and I want to reiterate our commitment to systematic margin improvement through operational excellence, supporting our long-term profitability framework. While we are closely monitoring the macro environment, including geopolitical, election uncertainty and tariffs, our overall outlook for the year remains positive.\nWith that, please turn to Slide 8, and I'll turn the call back over to Matthew for closing comments.\n\nMatthew Francis Pine\n\nSVP and President of Applied Water Systems & Americas Commercial Team, Xylem Inc.\n\nThanks, Bill.\nI'd like to mention 2 events in the quarter that don't show up in the financial results, but are fundamental to Xylem's success and impact. First, in June, just a few weeks after our Investor Day, we gathered Xylem's global leadership team in Washington, D.C. This was the first time we had our top 150 executives in 1 room, spanning legacy Xylem and legacy Evoqua. It was an energizing 2 days of collaboration, focused on the work of leadership alignment and culture. I've spoken before about culture as the fundamental how of Xylem, how we'll deliver stronger execution of our strategy, how we realize our aspirations, how we'll create our next chapter of Xylem's impact. You can see in our second quarter results that the team is already working well and winning. What our Leadership Summit reinforced was how much more value creation potential we have ahead of us with an aligned team and a high-impact culture. It was fantastic to see the team so engaged by the opportunities ahead of us. Last quarter also saw the publication of our annual sustainability report. We're very pleased to be tracking well towards our 2025 goals. But we took the opportunity presented by this year's report to set out our aspirations beyond 2025. We're raising the bar again by setting 2030 sustainability goals in 3 strategic areas. The first is decarbonization, reducing our own greenhouse gas emissions and enabling our customers to decarbonize. Secondly is water stewardship aimed at reducing water demand. And finally, we'll provide access to water, sanitation and hygiene for 80 million people. All 3 strengthen our customer relationships and increase our impact.\nBefore turning to your questions, I have 1 more special note. This is Andrea van der Berg last quarterly earnings call at the helm of Investor Relations. We're happy to announce that Andrea is taking on a new role within Xylem, and it's an exciting new opportunity for her. Over the years, so many of you have told me you deeply value Andrea's energy, accessibility and professionalism, and I benefited from her insightful counsel and positive encouragement in every circumstance. So thank you, Andrea.\nSome of you have already met Keith Butner, who is taking the reins as our Investor Relations leader. Keith has had great impact as the Head of Finance and Water Solutions and Services segment, having joined us with the Evoqua combination more than a year ago. He brings deep knowledge of the business to his leadership of IR, and I'm confident you'll enjoy getting to know Keith, and we'll find great value in his insights and perspectives.\nAnd with that, let's go to your questions."

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Andrea van der Berg, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nAndrea van der Berg\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Xylem's Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. With me today are Chief Executive Officer, Matthew Pine, and Chief Financial Officer, Bill Grogan. They will provide their perspective on Xylem's fourth quarter and full year 2023 results and discuss our outlook and guidance for 2024.\nFollowing our prepared remarks, we will address questions related to the information covered on the call. I'll ask you to please keep to one question and a follow-up and then return to the queue. As a reminder, this call and our webcast are accompanied by a slide presentation available in the Investors section of our website.

For purposes of today's call, all references will be on organic and on adjusted basis, unless otherwise indicated, and non-GAAP financials have been reconciled for you and are included in the Appendix section of the presentation.\nNow please turn to Slide 4, and I'll turn the call over to our CEO, Matthew Pine.\n\nMatthew Francis Pine\n\nSVP and President of Applied Water Systems & Americas Commercial Team, Xylem Inc.\n\nThanks, Andrea. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. It's a pleasure to share the Xylem team's exceptional performance in the fourth quarter of a transformational year for the enterprise. The team delivered both Q4 and full year results exceeding expectations on revenue and earnings per share.\nLooking at the fourth quarter, strong demand drove organic revenue growth of 9%. With disciplined execution, delivering EBITDA margin expansion of 90 basis points, that drove double-digit orders growth, and our backlog is now more than $5 billion. Our Q4 performance capped off a year in which the team overdelivered in every quarter.\nFull year organic revenues were up 12% with EBITDA margin expansion of 190 basis points and adjusted earnings per share growth of 20%. The team even delivered Evoqua run rate cost synergies in 2023 ahead of plan. Both the quarter and the full year give us very strong momentum entering 2024.\nDespite a dynamic environment and the excitement of our combination with Evoqua, the team stayed focused on serving our customers. Joining forces with Evoqua has put the sector's most advanced portfolio of capabilities in the hands of our customers and open up new opportunities to address even more of their water challenges.\nIn our last earnings call, we shared a bit about the synergy traction we're seeing between the legacy Evoqua services business in Xylem's dewatering business. And since then, we've seen the momentum continue to build as the team wins in the marketplace with our combined offering. On January 1, we made it even easier for our customers to access the full breadth of our capabilities with the creation of the Water Solutions and Services segment, effectively combining Xylem and Evoqua services offerings in a realigned segment structure. The move supports the continuing growth of our services business and expansion of recurring revenues. And to put Xylem in an even stronger position to capture value by serving industrial water customers who are increasingly outsourcing water management as water stresses intensify.\nLooking forward, we are starting off strong in 2024 with the momentum from our outperformance in '23, and continued healthy demand in our major end markets. Though we're keeping a close eye on demand dynamics in China and are taking a prudent view of end markets for Applied Water, which is our most cyclical segment, our backlog across the business is a source of continuing strength, especially in M&CS. We also feel very confident in our ability to drive continuing margin expansion by focusing our energy on the parts of the business delivering the greatest value. Overall, we're well positioned for profitable and sustainable growth. We expect 2024 organic revenues to be up 3% to 5% with solid EBITDA margin expansion, resulting in earnings per share between $4 and $4.20.\nI'll now turn it over to Bill to walk through the quarter's results and our outlook for 2024 in more detail.\n\nWilliam K. Grogan\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, IDEX Corp.\n\nThanks, Matthew. Please turn to Slide 5. As Matthew mentioned, we are pleased with the strong finish to 2023. The team has stayed focused and consistently were delivered throughout the year, exceeding our expectations on revenue and earnings per share for Q4 and the full year. We continue to see resilient demand and are supported by our $5.1 billion backlog, which grew 5% organically for the year. Organic orders grew 10% in the quarter, with book-to-bill approximately 1 for the quarter and greater than 1 for the full year. Total revenues grew 41%, while organic revenues rose 9%, exceeding our guidance of 4% to 5%. Our performance was led by MCS and water infrastructure. All regions grew, led by double-digit growth in the U.S.\nEBITDA margin was 19.6%, up 90 basis points from the prior year. With productivity savings, price and higher volume more than offsetting inflation, this reflects 33% incrementals on the legacy's Island performance. We finished the year with EBITDA margin of 18.9%, up nearly 200 basis points over prior year. Our EPS in the quarter was $0.99, above the high end of our guide by $0.03. When excluding the impact of Evoqua, EPS was $1.10, up 10% over prior year.\nOur financial position remains robust with over $1 billion in cash and available liquidity of approximately $2 billion. We ended the year with adjusted free cash flow conversion of 122%, exceeding our expectations and significantly improved versus last year.\nPlease turn to Slide 6. Before I highlight each segment's fourth quarter performance, I want to touch on some changes you'll see in our earnings materials going forward. In the spirit of [ 80/20 ], we have simplified our earnings materials to focus on what is most important for investors. To insist with the transition this quarter, we have provided our historical presentation format in the appendix.\nAnd now on to the segment performance. Measurement & Control Solutions saw robust orders growth of 14%, with strength across the portfolio, led by metrology and assessment services. Backlog is $2.3 billion and book-to-bill is above 1, a reflection of the strong demand for our AMI solutions and other digital offerings. M&CS revenue was up 21%, driven by metrology backlog execution and strong demand. We finished the quarter with improved EBITDA margins of 17.3%, up 220 basis points versus the prior year and up 160 basis points sequentially on productivity, price and higher volumes.\nWater Infrastructure also saw orders growth of 9% for the quarter, with strength across the portfolio led by robust treatment demand globally. Revenue exceeded our expectations with total growth of 30%, an organic growth of 9%, driven by robust OpEx demand across all regions. EBITDA margin for the segment was down 90 basis points, driven by the impacts of legacy Evoqua. When excluding the impact of Evoqua, EBITDA margin was up 50 basis points primarily due to price, productivity and volume more than offsetting inflation and unfavorable mix.\nIn Applied Water, although orders grew, book-to-bill was 0.9x, as we continue to work down our backlog, and we saw softer demand environment in the U.S., our largest geography. Revenues were flat, in line with our guide with the decline in developed markets offset slightly offset slightly by growth in emerging markets. Segment EBITDA margin expanded 80 basis points with productivity and price more than offsetting inflation and volume declines.\nIntegrated Solutions and Services, orders grew 5% on a pro forma basis, and book-to-bill was 1. Demand was driven by services. Pro forma revenue growth of 10% exceeded our expectations as implied in our reported guidance with healthy growth across the portfolio. Adjusted EBITDA margin was strong at 21.1% driven by price realization and volume.\nPlease turn to Slide 7. I will cover our segment outlook for the year. As Matthew mentioned, in December, we announced the creation of Water Solutions and Services segment. We are providing organic revenue guidance based on our previous reporting segments. Later this month, we will provide recast financial information aligned to the new segments. However, we expect the segment guidance outlook to largely be in line with the new segment structure and we'll update as needed in our Q1 earnings call.\nIn M&CS, we expected growth of low teens. Demand and order momentum for our AMI solutions remains strong. We expect to see sequential revenue improvement throughout 2024 supported by a robust backlog. In Water Infrastructure, we expect growth of mid-single digits. We expect resilient OpEx demand due to mission-critical nature of our applications and a healthy CapEx demand. We are continuing to closely monitor softness in China where the majority of our business is in the utility end market.\nIn Applied Water, we expect a modest decline of low single digits. We continue to see pockets of softness across our end markets, particularly in developed markets, which make up about 80% of our business. We also expect to see headwinds as we lap price increases and our backlog returns to more historic levels.\nISS growth is expected to be mid-single digits with growth across both capital and services. We continue to see strong activity in our funnel particularly in high-growth verticals such as food and beverage, energy and life sciences. This segment is supported by $1 billion in backlog and a durable service business model. And as a reminder, the ISS growth outlook is on an organic basis.\nNow let's turn to Slide 8 for our 2024 and Q1 guidance. The growth outlook by segment translates to 2024 full revenue of $8.4 billion to $8.5 billion, resulting in total revenue growth of 14% to 15% and organic revenue growth of 3% to 5%. EBITDA margin is expected to be 19.4% to 19.9%. This represents 50 to 100 basis points of expansion versus the prior year, driven by higher volume, productivity and price offsetting inflation. This yields an EPS range of $4 to $4.20, up 8% at the midpoint over prior year. We are expecting approximately $100 million of exit run rate cost synergies in 2024, which is embedded in our guide. Free cash flow conversion for the year is expected to be 115% of net income.\nDrilling down on the first quarter. We anticipate total revenue growth will be in the 36% to 38% range on a reported basis and 4% to 6% organically. We expect first quarter EBITDA margin to be approximately 18%, up 170 basis points, driven by higher volumes, continued price realization and productivity gains. This yields first quarter EPS of $0.80 to $0.85.\nWe are entering the year with momentum and from a position of strength. Our balanced outlook reflects our strong commercial position and the durability of our portfolio. While we also continue to monitor broader market conditions, particularly in China and Applied Water, which is our shortest-cycle business. In the case of larger-than-expected volume declines, we're ready to take additional cost actions as needed to ensure continued focus on margin expansion. Overall, our expectations for the year remain positive as we build on our strong momentum.\nWith that, please turn to Slide 9, and I'll turn the call back over to Matthew for closing comments.\n\nMatthew Francis Pine\n\nSVP and President of Applied Water Systems & Americas Commercial Team, Xylem Inc.\n\nThanks, Bill. It's been incredibly exciting to step up as CEO at a time of such great momentum and opportunity for Xylem. I began the year by spending time with customers and colleagues in India and the Middle East. Bill and I started off a in India, in the scale of ambition there, to modernize infrastructure and tackle the big water challenges is frankly awe inspiring. We have an outstanding team there, doing great work to serve customers from our localized R&D and manufacturing platform that gives us a real competitive advantage. And both India and the Middle East provide great reminders of the fundamental interconnectedness of economic value and social value creation in our business.\nThese markets present expansive commercial opportunity. In both markets, every project improves lives and increase the sustainability of communities. We took some time out with colleagues in India to visit a school in a rural area outside of Bangalore. We got hands on building a small-scale water treatment system that now provides clean drinking water to those students and their community. I'll be honest, the experience of celebrating with those kids and their teachers as the clean water started to flow, well, it's just hard to describe. And you also know that the impact on educational outcomes, health and quality of life is likely to be profound. That experience drove home for me not just the importance of what Xylem does but it reinforced the focus we're bringing into 2024. Whether at the scale of a school or the scale of a mega city, we have to make it easier for customers and communities to solve their big water challenges. Reducing the complexity of water solutions, that is our focus, simplifying water.\nWe have assembled the most advanced and most comprehensive portfolio of products, solutions and services in this sector. The value creation opportunity in front of us is to make all that capability far easier for customers to access, to empower them to solve their most critical water challenges and deliver great outcomes with far less complexity.\nWe started the year with great pace with strong execution off the back of a great Q4 in 2023 across both legacy Xylem and legacy Evoqua businesses. And our integration is well on track to deliver on the full value creation opportunity of the combination. Our end markets are resilient, and as long as the long-term trends in water continue to intensify, our team is energized to take all of our capabilities to deliver even greater impact for our customers.\nOur investment thesis remains robust, and we continue to execute on the strategy that has positioned us so strongly for further economic and social value creation. We look forward to sharing further insights into our priorities and strategic direction at our upcoming Investor Day on May 30 in Washington, D.C., when I hope many of you will join us.\nNow operator, I'll turn the call back over to you for questions."

For purposes of today's call, all references will be on an organic and/or adjusted basis, unless otherwise indicated. And non-GAAP financials have been reconciled for you and are included in the Appendix section of the presentation.\nNow please turn to Slide 4, and I'll turn the call over to our CEO, Matthew Pine.\n\nMatthew Francis Pine\n\nSVP and President of Applied Water Systems & Americas Commercial Team, Xylem Inc.\n\nThanks, Andrea. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. The Xylem team delivered a very strong first quarter, outperforming expectations on all metrics. The team drove high single-digit organic revenue growth, reflecting a healthy balance of both volume and price. And the team also expanded adjusted EBITDA margin almost 300 basis points. And without outperformance, we delivered EPS growth of 14%.\nThe story is pretty straightforward. We have strong commercial and operational momentum with resilient underlying demand in the majority of our segments in end markets. I want to thank all our teams for doing a great job. But I want to highlight 2 teams in particular, Measurement & Control Solutions and Water Solutions and services. In both segments, focused effort paid off in really outstanding numbers.\nIn MCS, organic revenue grew more than 20% and margins are up over 500 basis points year-over-year. And in its first quarter as a combined segment, WSS stayed focused on serving our customers and deliver both the highest orders growth of all segments and made a significant contribution to Xylem's overall margin mix.\nIn addition to operational and commercial performance, the first quarter also reflected continued momentum on integration synergies with Evoqua. We saw a very solid Q1 run rate on cost capture, and we're confident in how we're tracking both on revenue and cost synergies.\nOn the basis of our momentum, the team's disciplined performance and continuing resilient demand we're raising our full year guidance for both revenue and margin and lifting our EPS guidance $0.08 from the midpoint.\nAs we look forward, operationally, we're focused on maximizing value from every additional incremental volume we deliver. The team's impressive first quarter margin performance reflects our increasing operational discipline. We're driving simplification across our business, doing the few things that matter most even more efficiently.\nTo solve water, we have to simplify water both for our customers and for ourselves. Strategically, our demand outlook continues to be supported by secular trends that are set to continue across economic cycles. As the headlines reflect, we're seeing an increasingly water-challenged world. And just as with energy, the water economy is intertwined with every part of business and life.\nSo as water security becomes pressing, we'll continue to see increasing demand for the solutions that can help make companies and communities more water secure, and Xylem's platform of capabilities is uniquely positioned to meet this demand. We recently announced we'll be hosting our Investor Day on May 30 to take place both virtually and here at our headquarters in Washington. We're looking forward to the opportunity to provide updates on our strategic outlook, long-term growth and financial framework and our 2030 sustainability goals. And with that, I'll hand it over to Bill to cover the quarter's results, our financial position and our outlook in more detail. Bill?\n\nWilliam K. Grogan\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, IDEX Corp.\n\nThanks, Matthew. Please turn to Slide 5. Q1 was an excellent start to the year, exceeding expectations across revenue, margin and earnings per share. I want to echo Matthew's thanks to all of our teams for remaining focused and turning in an outstanding quarter. We continue to see resilient demand with our backlog increasing 4% to $5.3 billion. Organic orders grew 3% in the quarter with book-to-bill above 1, supported by strength across developed markets, particularly in WSS.\nTotal revenues grew 40%, and organic revenues rose 7%, exceeding our guidance and a healthy combination of volume and price. Our performance was led by M&CS and WSS and we saw growth in all regions, led by double-digit growth in the U.S. EBITDA margin was 19.2%, up 290 basis points from the prior year, with productivity savings, strong volume, price and mix more than offsetting inflation and investments. This reflects incrementals of 26% on a consolidated basis and 57% on an organic basis.\nOur EPS in the quarter was $0.90, above the high end of our guide by $0.05, up 14% over the prior year. Our balance sheet remains healthy with ample liquidity to support capital deployment. We started the year with free cash flow conversion of 9%. This represents significant improvement versus typical seasonality of negative Q1 free cash flow conversion. This year, we delivered higher net income, offset slightly by increased CapEx.\nPlease turn to Slide 6. Measurement & Control Solutions had a great quarter and exceeded our expectations. Orders grew 3% on continued smart metering demand. Backlog rose to $2.2 billion, up 6% organically and book-to-bill came in slightly under [ 1% ] due to greater backlog conversion. M&CS revenue was up 22%, driven by smart metering demand and backlog execution. We finished the quarter with EBITDA margins of 22.7%, up 550 basis points versus the prior year and up 440 basis points sequentially. Margin expansion was driven by productivity, higher volume and price and favorable mix more than offsetting inflation.\nIn Water Infrastructure, orders grew 6% in the quarter, led by robust transport demand. Revenue exceeded our expectations with total growth of 40% and organic growth of 6%, driven by healthy demand across all regions and applications. EBITDA margin for the segment was up 320 basis points driven by productivity, mix, volume and price offsetting inflation. In Applied Water, although orders declined versus a year ago, book-to-bill was greater than [ 1 ], reflective of a few large project wins. Revenues were down 4%, in line with our expectations against strong growth in the first quarter last year, primarily driven by a decline in developed markets.\nSegment EBITDA margin declined 380 basis points year-over-year on unfavorable mix, higher inflation and volume declines, partly offset by productivity savings.\nWrapping up with water solutions and services. Orders grew 7% organically led by dewatering and 19% on a pro forma basis with book-to-bill well above 1 in the quarter, driven by a large order for a 20-year outsourced water contract, but even excluding that large order, pro forma demand increased. Organic revenue was up 6%, while pro forma revenue increased 9%, with healthy growth across most of the businesses. Adjusted EBITDA margin was strong at 22.3%, driven by favorable mix in volume and price and productivity.\nThe outperformance across WSS is a great reflection of our team staying focused on what matters, serving our customers throughout this integration and resegmentation.\nNow let's turn to Slide 7 for our updated full year and second quarter guidance. Given our first quarter outperformance and both commercial and operational momentum, we are raising our full year guidance. We are increasing our revenue guide to approximately $8.5 billion. This reflects an additional point of growth versus prior guidance. That will put total revenue growth at 15% to 16% and organic revenue growth at 4% to 6%. We are confident about driving further margin expansion with operational productivity and are raising our EBITDA margin guidance to about 20%. That represents 110 basis points of expansion versus the prior year driven by higher volume, productivity, including cost synergies and price offsetting inflation. Our updated EPS guidance of $4.10 to $4.25 reflects an increase of $0.08 at the midpoint.\nWe continue to expect around $100 million of exit rate cost synergies in 2024. And free cash flow conversion for the year is still expected to be 115% of net income. The full year outlook at the segment levels remain largely unchanged from our comments in February.\nFor the second quarter, we anticipate total revenue growth will be 23% to 25% on a reported basis and 5% to 7% organically. We expect second quarter EBITDA margin to be approximately 20%, up 90 basis points, driven by higher volumes, continued price realization and productivity gains. This yields second quarter EPS of $1 to $1.05.\nWe came into 2024 at a healthy pace, and we've had a strong start to the year, building further momentum. Our diversified portfolio positions us well to address our customers' evolving needs, and we anticipate healthy demand across most end markets and applications. While we are closely monitoring the macro environment, including inflation, higher interest rates for longer, a strengthening dollar and geopolitical uncertainty, our overall outlook for the year remains positive.\nWith that, please turn to Slide 8, and I'll turn the call back over to Matthew for closing comments.\n\nMatthew Francis Pine\n\nSVP and President of Applied Water Systems & Americas Commercial Team, Xylem Inc.\n\nThanks, Bill. Two things I want to mention before we close. First, it's been such a privilege in my first 100 days as CEO to spend time with so many Xylem colleagues around the world. You can see they're doing fantastic work, and it's evident in today's results. And our integration progress is a great indicator of how smoothly the Xylem and [ Evoqua ] teams have come together. As a combined company, there is so much potential for growth and impact, especially as we pivot to even stronger execution of our strategy. To achieve our potential, we're being very intentional about the culture we're building. Specifically, we're creating a culture centered on behaviors that drive empowerment, accountability and innovation. We call it our high-impact culture, and it's the heart of our how, how we are creating the next phase of Xylem's growth and impact. Of course, culture change takes time, and it starts with myself and the leadership team. So it's incredibly energizing to see the cultural alignment already coming to life in our town halls and business reviews at all levels in the organization. We'll talk a bit more about how we're fostering our high-impact culture when we gather together for Investor Day at the end of May.\nLastly, on Investor Day, we'll also be launching our 2023 sustainability report. We're very proud of what we've achieved and even more motivated by the work ahead. In this year's report, we'll be introducing our combined company goals for the first time, setting our ambition for impact through 2030. Given how fundamental sustainability is Xylem's business model, I invite you to give it as much attention as you give our financial results. And as always, we welcome your feedback. And with that, I'll turn it over to the operator to lead us through Q&A."

Decker\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Xylem Inc.\n\nThanks, Andrea, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased to announce a very strong third quarter performance, continuing our momentum from the first half of the year. Across the board, the team delivered above expectations with all our business segments and regions posting strong double-digit revenue growth. And we see quite resilient demand in our backlogs and bidding pipeline. Overall, revenues were up 16% for the quarter, beating the high end of our guidance by 4 percentage points. Applied Water grew fastest at 20%. Water Infrastructure exceeded expectations by the widest margin and M&CS came in right on target with healthy mid-teens growth. Regionally, Americas, Western Europe and Emerging Markets each grew mid-teens.\nDemand at all of our largest end markets continued to be strong driven by the essential nature of our solutions and services and by intensifying long-term trends in Water. The team, from our factories to our channel partners and distributors, also delivered a tremendous operational performance. Their actions entirely offset inflation with very strong price cost discipline and effectively manage through continuing chip supply constraints. That focus paid off in growth, but also with very strong EBITDA margin expansion.\nMargins exceeded the high end of our guidance by 130 basis points. This delivered on our previous commitment to significantly improve our margins in the second half of this year. Strong organic revenue growth and accretive margins drove third quarter earnings well above expectations, with earnings per share of $0.79.\nAs you all know, our key end markets have consistently been resilient in the face of macroeconomic headwinds, and we expect that underlying demand pattern to continue. M&CS orders continue to be very strong. Water Infrastructure was up solidly. Backlogs continue to be up sharply year-over-year, and the digital solutions proportion of our backlogs continue to expand.\nThat said, some of our smaller end markets are more cyclical, such as residential within our Applied Water segment. Orders in those markets were down in the quarter and are expected to remain soft.\nLooking forward, we anticipate the demand dynamics of the third quarter to continue into 2023. On supply, especially chip supply, the outlook remains consistent with what we said last quarter. As expected, we have not seen meaningful easing of chip supply constraints. But forecasting visibility has improved, as has the reliability of deliveries. We expect to exit the year as we've outlined before. Things are gradually improving.\nGiven the resilience of our demand profile, the vitality of our business and the team's strong operational track record in this environment, we are raising our full year guidance. We now expect full year adjusted earnings per share to be between $2.65 to $2.75 on organic revenue growth between 9% and 10%.\nIn a few minutes, we'll discuss dynamics in our different end markets, along with some trends we're seeing through the current cycle. I'll also touch on how we're serving communities as they invest to become more resilient in the face of intensifying water challenges. But first, let me hand it over to Sandy to offer you some more detail on the third quarter.\n\nSandra E. Rowland\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Xylem Inc.\n\nThanks, Patrick. Please turn to Slide 5. The team did a great job over delivering on commitments with disciplined commercial and operational execution on continuing strong demand. As a result, revenues grew globally, high teens in the U.S. and mid-teens in Emerging Markets in Western Europe on strong price and backlog execution as supply chains modestly improved.\nIn a moment, I'll detail performance by segment. But in short, utilities was up 15%, led by strength in the U.S. and Western Europe. Industrial grew 16% with strength across all geographies, particularly in Emerging Markets in Western Europe. Commercial was up 17%, mainly due to strong backlog execution in the U.S.; and residential was up 19%, led by commercial execution and backlog conversion in the U.S. Global demand remains healthy on strong end market fundamentals, especially in Water Infrastructure and M&CS.\nThat said, organic orders were down 1% in the quarter versus up 20% in the same period last year. Water Infrastructure was up 3%, AWS down 4% and M&CS down 2%. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 18.3%, up 40 basis points from the prior year and up 170 basis points sequentially as price more than offset inflation. And as Patrick mentioned, our EPS in the quarter was $0.79, well above expectations.\nPlease turn to Slide 6, and I'll review the quarter's performance by segment. Water Infrastructure revenue grew 13% organically in the quarter, exceeding expectations. Growth was broad-based, led by our wastewater utility business in the U.S. and Western Europe, both up high teens as supply chain constraints improved. Industrial growth remained robust, driven by continued dewatering demand in Emerging Markets and increased activity in Western Europe. Geographically, Western Europe grew mid-teens, driven by robust transport and treatment demand. The U.S. was up low teens, led by strong utilities OpEx demand. Emerging Markets was up low double digits, driven by strength across Latin America and Africa, a continued growth in dewatering.\nOrders in the third quarter were up 3% organically with robust dewatering demand in Emerging Markets and continued utility strengths in the U.S. Segment EBITDA margin was largely in line with the prior year as favorable price realization offset inflation but was also impacted by unfavorable mix and strategic investments.\nPlease turn to Page 7. In the Applied Water segment, third quarter revenues grew 20% organically, exceeding expectations. Growth was robust across all end markets, with each up high teens or greater. Geographically, the U.S. was up high teens with strength across all 3 end markets due to price realization and modest improvements in supply chain. Western Europe was also up high teens, led by growth in industrial, on strong price and continued demand. Emerging Markets was up almost 30%, driven by strong industrial demand in China and commercial development in the Middle East and Africa. Orders were down 4% organically with continued growth in Emerging Markets, offset by some moderation in residential in the U.S.\nAs a reminder, residential, our most cyclical end market, is only about 5% of our overall revenue. EBITDA margin for the segment was up 110 basis points compared to the prior year and 200 basis points sequentially. Margin expansion was driven by strong price realization, more than offsetting inflation, supplemented with productivity savings.\nAnd now let's turn to Slide 8, and I'll cover our Measurement & Control Solutions business. M&CS revenue was up 15% organically, in line with our prior guidance as chip supply played out as expected, with continued moderate improvement sequentially. We also saw strong growth in test applications and our pipeline assessment services business. Geographically, the U.S. was up more than 20% on improved chip availability versus the prior year and favorable price realization. Emerging Markets was up mid-teens, and Western Europe was up high single digits, driven by strength in our test and pipeline assessment services businesses.\nM&CS orders declined 2% organically in the quarter, lapping a tough prior year compare of 42% orders growth. Underlying demand for our AMI offerings remains strong, and orders continue to outpace revenue, yielding backlog growth of 35% versus the prior year. Our M&CS backlog alone exceeds $2 billion. Segment EBITDA margin in the quarter expanded 400 basis points sequentially and is now approaching prior year levels. The team did a great job driving margin improvement, even though volumes continue to be constrained by chip supply.\nAnd now let's turn to Slide 9 for an overview of cash flows and our balance sheet. In the third quarter, we generated free cash flow of $149 million, driven by income conversion, partially offset by higher working capital. You will note that our working capital levels are elevated as we've chosen to carry about 30 days of extra inventory. And while supply chains are gradually improving, delivery metrics are below historical levels, and we can best serve our customers and communities by making this short-term investment. Having said that, our financial position remains strong with $1.2 billion in cash and $2 billion of available liquidity, and our net debt-to-EBITDA leverage is 1.3x.\nPlease turn to Slide 10, and I'll hand it back to Patrick to give some color on underlying demand.\n\nDeane Michael Dray\n\nMD of Multi-Industry & Electrical Equipment & Analyst, RBC Capital Markets, Research Division\n\nThanks, Sandy. In our last quarter's earnings call, we impact how demand in different end markets respond to macroeconomic headwinds. What we described then is what we're seeing in the marketplace now with healthy underlying demand in our largest end markets. Those patterns have repeated over past economic cycles. So they inform how we manage our operations in an environment like this one. Since all water is local, we experienced those patterns and trends playing out at a community level. What we're seeing is more and more communities selling increasing impact from climate change. They're finding their aging infrastructure isn't up to the task and then confronting the economic anxiety of major upgrades.\nSo communities are investing both in short-term response and in longer-term resilience. Infrastructure investment is the much bigger driver of underlying demand. But our customers have to know we will also be there in near-term crisis, which are happening all too frequently. For example, when Hurricane Ian hit Florida, our dewatering pumps were already in place ahead of the storm to prevent the worst and recover fast. And storms are the only immediate needs. One Southeastern U.S. city called us with sewer lines leaching waste into community groundwater and their aging pipes are on the brink of collapse. Within days of that call, we were building a boathouse that will help that city's wastewater treatment running without interruption, while they make long-term repairs. Helping communities respond to shocks is a fundamental part of our mission. But the more durable value is in helping communities build the strength to withstand future water challenges and economic stresses.\nXylem Solutions like advanced metering infrastructure, wastewater network optimization and municipal water recycling, amongst so many others, provide much more than compelling economics. They deliver game-changing resilience. With AMI as an example, cities can cut off water in the event of storm damage, respond instantly to customer crisis and even promote conservation through periods of scarcity and drought. And all of that additional capability costs a city less than their conventional meter networks. That value equation isn't unique to AMI. It's a hallmark of digital solutions across our Xylem portfolio, greater resilience and capability delivered far more affordably than conventional approaches. Those benefits are so important to our customers that we have been steadily extending digital capability into every part of our portfolio.\nThe mini water crisis making headlines in recent months make it clear that the effects of climate change are already driving rapid increases in cost at the community level. To attack the problem at its source, more and more cities are making net zero emissions commitments. Our opportunity is to help water utilities reduce their own carbon footprint.\nMore than 80 leading utilities around the world have already set net zero targets. Last month at WEFTEC, which is one of the largest water trade events each year, we shared research showing how utilities can dramatically cut their emissions while boosting operational efficiency at the same time. The message is good for our customers, good for communities and good for our business. With existing technologies, you can reduce emissions quickly at low cost or even saving money. I am so proud of the team for leading the way on this topic with our customers and our communities.\nSeveral of my Xylem colleagues will be speaking at the upcoming COP27 climate meetings in Egypt later this month, to promote the discussion of water, which we believe is the most important topic of our time.\nNow I'll turn it back over to Sandy to provide detail on our increased guidance and outlook for the year.\n\nSandra E. Rowland\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Xylem Inc.\n\nThanks, Patrick. Consistent with our previous presentations, we provided key facts for each end market in the appendix. The 2022 full year outlook across our end markets remains largely in line with our previous guidance, with an increase in commercial upon improved backlog execution. We expect healthy underlying demand will carry on through the remainder of the year with continued modest improvements in supply chain. The outlook for our utility business remains unchanged with mid-single-digit growth across both wastewater and clean water.\nIn wastewater, we see continued OpEx strength, and the CapEx outlook is supported by modernization of aging infrastructure and continued new development, particularly in Emerging Markets.\nFor clean water utilities, although chip supply remains constrained, we do expect a continued modest easing of chip supply sequentially. We also expect momentum in our test and pipeline assessment businesses to continue due to increasing focus on infrastructure and climate challenges.\nLooking at the industrial end market, we now expect low double-digit growth lifted from a previous range of high single-digit to low double-digit growth, driven by strong global demand for dewatering and continued underlying demand for our solutions in the U.S. and Western Europe. We now expect the commercial end market to deliver high single to low double-digit growth, up from mid-single to high single digits on strong demand and backlog execution.\nIn residential, our smallest end market, we expect strong price realization and continued backlog execution to drive growth in the high teens. As a reminder, our commercial and residential exposure is largely replacement-driven and is approximately 15% of our total revenue.\nAnd now let's turn to Slide 12, and I'll walk you through our updated guidance. Our continued out-performance gives us confidence to raise our full year guidance for adjusted EPS to a range of $2.65 to $2.75, up from $2.50 to $2.70. Our raised guidance is driven by stronger price, backlog execution and continued underlying demand. We are also lifting the low end of our full year organic revenue growth, now 9% to 10%, up from 8% to 10%. Our revenue outlook on a reported basis is largely unchanged due to FX headwinds.\nLooking by segment, we expect high single-digit growth in Water Infrastructure and low double-digit growth in Applied Water. We expect Measurement & Control Solutions to be up mid-single digits as chip supply continues to modestly improve.\nFor 2022, we are raising our adjusted EBITDA margin outlook to approximately 17%. We now expect free cash flow conversion to be approximately 80% of net income. This is lower than our previous outlook, largely due to higher working capital levels as I referenced earlier. While we're carrying about an extra month of inventory, our position is fully aligned with the requirements needed to fulfill our backlog. As supply chain stabilize, we will bring inventory down, enabling us to return free cash flow conversion of at least 100% and as we have consistently done in prior years. We've provided you with a number of other full year assumptions on the slide to supplement your models as well as our latest assumptions on our basket of currency exposures, which can also be found in the appendix.\nAnd now drilling down on the fourth quarter, we anticipate total company organic revenues will be up 12% to 14%. This includes mid-single-digit growth in Water Infrastructure, mid-teens growth in Applied Water and M&CS growth of mid-20%. We expect fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA margin to be in the range of 17.5% to 18.5%.\nAnd with that, please turn to Slide 13, and I'll turn the call back over to Patrick for closing comments.\n\nPatrick K. Decker\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Xylem Inc.\n\nThanks, Sandy. I'm very proud of the team's performance overall. We delivered strong results this past quarter by continuing to do what we said we would do. And indeed, the team overdelivered, thanks to our commercial momentum and operational discipline. Even in an environment of macro uncertainty, the durability of our business model, and the discipline of our team gives us great confidence in our continued growth and significant value creation over the long run.\nBefore we turn the call over to your questions, I'd like to share a couple of executive appointments we've just made, adding even further strength to Xylem's leadership bench. Earlier, I referred to our strategy of extending digital capabilities across Xylem's product, solutions and services portfolio. We've just taken an important step in accelerating that process, appointing Xylem's first Chief Digital Officer. Sai Allavarpu joined our senior leadership team last week, bringing extensive experience of growing digital businesses in the industrial sector. He'll be working with the team to further build out a simple powerful platform of digitized solutions for our customers and communities. He joins us in Danaher, and I look forward to introducing him to you in future conversations. Before sharing our second recent appointment, I first want to recognize a colleague many of you know.\nTony Milando, our Chief Supply Chain Officer, has been looking for the retirement for a while, but he graciously agreed to stay on while helping us guide the company through the challenges of the pandemic. He's built agility and durability into our supply chain, put safety and sustainability at the center of our operations and created a culture of continuous improvement that has made operational excellence a core part of Xylem's competitive advantage. We're finally letting Tony retire, but his contributions will continue to benefit our stakeholders for many years to come.\nTo build on the foundation of excellence that Tony has laid, we've appointed Thomas Pettit, Xylem's Chief Operations and Supply Chain Officer. Tom joins us next week coming from Generac Power Systems, and he brings 20-plus years of experience leading global supply chains and operations in the industrial and services sectors. We're very pleased to welcome Tom at a time when supply chain and operations continue to be a foundation of competitive advantage. His remit is to take our operational excellence to the next level. Tony is going to stay on for a brief time to give him a good start and ensure a smooth transition.\nSo with that, operator, let's now open it up for Q&A."

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Andrea van der Berg, Vice President of Investor Relations.\n\nAndrea van der Berg\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Xylem's Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. With me today are Chief Executive Officer, Patrick Decker; Chief Financial Officer, Sandy Rowland; and Chief Operating Officer, Matthew Pine. They will provide their perspective on Xylem's second quarter 2023 results and discuss the third quarter and full year outlook.\nFollowing our prepared remarks, we will address questions related to the information covered on the call. I'll ask that you please keep to one question and a follow-up and then return to the queue. As a reminder, this call and our webcast are accompanied by a slide presentation available in the Investors section of our website, www.xylem.com.

For purposes of today's call, all references will be on an organic and/or adjusted basis, unless otherwise indicated and non-GAAP financials have been reconciled for you and are included in the Appendix section of the presentation.\nNow please turn to Slide 4, and I'll turn the call over to our CEO, Patrick Decker.\n\nDeane Michael Dray\n\nAnalyst, Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (Broker)\n\nThanks, Andrea, and good morning, everyone. Today is a significant milestone for Xylem as we have the pleasure to present the performance and outlook of quite a different company than just a quarter ago as we describe our ability to make an impact on the world as society deals with growing water challenges.\nThe combination of Xylem and Evoqua has already begun taking shape as an even stronger global platform that will have a profoundly positive impact on our customers and communities. We have a responsibility in front of us to help at exactly the moment when the world's water challenges are coming into more acute focus than ever. When we completed the acquisition in May, our capability to meet this moment expanded along with our opportunities for growth. Now, 10 weeks into the integration of these 2 great enterprises, we are even more confident about the value we will create with our combined company.\nThere are 3 things that underpin that confidence. First, the team is delivering impressive performance across both companies. I am so very proud of our team for staying focused on serving our customers at a potentially distracting time. Each team, both legacy Xylem and Evoqua turned in a quarter significantly exceeding expectations and giving us brisk momentum for the future.\nSecond, our early progress on integration has increased our confidence and the cost synergies we previously laid out and the growth synergies ahead of us. We have moved well forward on both sources of value. And third, as water challenges continue to intensify for our customers across many parts of our economy and society, they are seeking simpler, more affordable ways to tackle them while we are now even more strongly positioned to solve those needs and capture that demand with increased exposure to attractive, durable end markets.\nWe'll come back at these bigger points in a few minutes, but I want to make sure we also give appropriate attention to the very strong quarter we just closed. As we shared in our press release this morning, we significantly exceeded expectations on revenue growth, margin and earnings per share. Organic revenue growth was 15%, with total reported revenue growth of 26%. EPS was up 32% and grew 28%, excluding the impact of the acquisition. And we delivered EBITDA margin well above our guide at more than 19%. It was driven by strong demand and the team's continued focus on pricing as well as ongoing continuous improvement aimed at simplifying how we serve our customers.\nOrganically, all segments contributed double-digit revenue growth in all end markets. And each of our regions grew, led by notably strong pace in the U.S. and a solid recovery in China. Our legacy backlog was up 7%. And then we added Evoqua's backlog of more than $1 billion, and the 2 together bring our total backlog to $5.3 billion.\nWell, we have a lot to do with the integration of these 2 great companies. We have strong commercial momentum, which gives us the confidence to raise our guidance for the year. And again, I want to thank every one of our team members around the world and our partners for what they are doing every day to deliver real impact to our customers and our communities.\nIn a moment, we'll give more color on our outlook as well as detail on our end markets and regions. But first, I'm going to hand it over to Sandy to dig into the quarter's strong results.\n\nSandra E. Rowland\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Xylem Inc.\n\nThanks, Patrick. Please turn to Slide 5. Since this is the first time we are reporting as a combined company, I would like to walk you through how we will cover our performance. We now have 4 reporting segments: Evoqua's Applied Product Technologies business has been integrated into water infrastructure, immediately combining our 2 complementary treatment product businesses. Evoqua's Integrated Solutions and Services business, or ISS, is reported as its own segment, providing continued transparency on the segment's results.\nOur other 2 segments, Measurement & Control Solutions and Applied Water are unchanged. Additionally, since this quarter includes about a month of Evoqua's results, we have laid out organic results compared to our previously shared expectations and broken out the impact of the acquisition. Unless otherwise stated, all growth rates shared are on an organic basis. And lastly, we have reported EPS on an adjusted basis that adds back noncash purchase accounting intangible amortization from the Evoqua acquisition and Xylem's previous acquisitions. We have therefore recast 2022 amounts for comparison purposes.\nAnd now let's turn to Slide 6 for our quarter's results. The team delivered strong performance, beating our expectations for both growth and margin expansion. Total revenues grew 26%, while organic revenue growth of 15% was led by double-digit growth in the U.S. and Western Europe and high single-digit growth in emerging markets. Each business exceeded our expectations, and we saw double-digit growth in all segments and end markets.\nUtilities was up 17% due to robust demand and price realization in both M&CS and Water Infrastructure. Industrial grew 11% on strong price realization and demand across all regions. And lastly, building solutions, which includes commercial and residential grew 15%. Overall, demand remains resilient as demonstrated by our $5.3 billion backlog, up 7% organically, as Patrick highlighted, and now includes Evoqua. And while orders were down 2% on the quarter, book-to-bill continues to be above 1.\nEBITDA margin was 19.1%, up 250 basis points from the prior year on higher volumes, productivity savings and favorable price cost dynamics. Excluding the impact of Evoqua, EBITDA margin was up 200 basis points, exceeding our previous expectations. Our EPS in the quarter was $0.98, up 32% year-over-year and up 28% excluding the impact of acquisitions. Please turn to Slide 7, and I'll review each segment's second quarter performance in a bit more detail.\nM&CS revenue was up 21%, driven by improved chip supply as well as strong demand in pipeline assessment services. U.S. and Western Europe saw robust growth, and we continue to see favorable momentum in emerging markets. Orders grew 6% with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.2 and our backlog of $2.4 billion is up 17% versus the prior year, demonstrating continued strong demand for our AMI offerings.\nEBITDA margin for the segment was up 590 basis points versus the prior year on strong incrementals. Volume conversion, price realization and productivity drove the expansion, more than offsetting inflation and unfavorable mix. And now let's turn to Slide 8, and I'll cover our Water Infrastructure business.\nWater Infrastructure, which now includes Evoqua's Applied Product Technologies segment grew 20% on a reported basis and 13% organically. Growth was robust across the portfolio, with revenues up double digits in all end markets and applications. Developed markets saw particularly strong growth driven by OpEx demand, while emerging markets grew 7%, driven by Latin America and Asia Pacific.\nOrders in the quarter were down 4% year-over-year, lapping prior year growth of over 20%, and book-to-bill was above 1. EBITDA margin for the segment was roughly flat year-over-year and up 20 basis points when excluding the contribution of Evoqua. Please turn to Slide 9 for an overview of Applied Water.\nApplied Water revenues grew 12% on continued strong price realization and backlog execution. The U.S. and emerging markets grew double digits, while Western Europe grew mid-single digits. Industrial demand was both resilient in both Western Europe and emerging markets, particularly due to recovery in China. And while orders were down 6% in the quarter, our backlog continues to be elevated versus historical levels, and book-to-bill is 0.9.\nSegment EBITDA margin was up 290 basis points in the quarter with continued strong price realization, coupled with productivity more than offsetting inflation. Please turn to Slide 10.\nI'm very pleased to introduce Integrated Solutions and Services as our newest reporting segment. ISS is a leading North American water treatment solution and services provider that brings access to a durable and highly recurring revenue stream as well as a diverse and attractive industrial verticals. With approximately 75% recurring revenue, ISS is known for dependability and bringing mission-critical water treatment expertise to our customers.\nAlthough we only reported ISS after our May 24 close, full quarter revenue was up 12%, driven by strong price realization and backlog execution. And orders grew 4% with a book-to-bill ratio above 1 due to broad-based demand across industrials and utilities. Backlog of nearly $1 billion to end the quarter was up 15% year-over-year. And adjusted EBITDA margin post close was a solid at 24%.\nAnd now let's turn to Slide 11 for an overview of cash flows and the company's financial position. After retiring over $600 million of debt in conjunction with the closing of Evoqua, our financial position remains robust as we exit the quarter with over $700 million in cash and available liquidity of $1.6 billion. Net debt-to-EBITDA leverage is 1.4x and in the second quarter, we had solid adjusted free cash flow conversion of 86%. Please turn to Slide 12, and I'll hand it back over to Patrick.\n\nPatrick K. Decker\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Xylem, Inc.\n\nThanks, Sandy. Just a little more than 2 months post close, our excitement about the Evoqua acquisition has only grown. We've made great progress in 3 areas. First is our performance and outlook as the business stands today. We began the integration with an overarching principle, and that was to deliver continuity for our customers, keep our commitments and not disrupt business performance. The results tell a clear story of focused near-term delivery.\nThe combination of our team's disciplined execution and healthy underlying market demand has given us the confidence to raise our full year guide. But our current performance is, as you would expect, largely a reflection of our businesses as they are. What we're most excited about is our future potential and the opportunities ahead of us, which brings me to the second dimension on which our confidence is only growing.\nWhen the transaction closed, we announced a combined leadership team. And frankly, I'm energized by the strong cultural fit the team has already been demonstrating and the early momentum we've created. We are well on track to deliver the cost synergies outlined when we announced the transaction. And as we progress through the integration, we have even more greater visibility of the operating efficiencies to be realized in coming quarters, along with the opportunity for significant further margin expansion.\nAt the same time, the whole [ spec ] rationale of this combination has always been about further accelerating our profitable growth. And that's the third dimension I referred to in my opening comments. We are now even more strongly positioned in attractive, durable end markets with a significant component of recurring revenue streams.\nNow that we have deeper insight into the intersection of our businesses and customers, we see those opportunities even more clearly.\nSo moving on to Slide 13. This is the right combination at the right time. Together, we have the strongest platform of capabilities to address customers' critical water challenges. Those needs are increasing, and we have the scale and reach now to deliver differentiated solutions globally. Our teams are already detailing how we will do that.\nFirst, in utilities, we will deepen our penetration, especially with the addition of Evoqua's Applied Product Technologies to our Water Infrastructure offerings. In industrial, we'll use the power of our combined offering to scale our presence in attractive industrial end markets. And then we will expand our Services Solutions business by leveraging Xylem's well-established global distribution platform.\nNow as many of you know, this combination delivers on part of the strategy we laid out back in our 2021 Investor Day, and that was to expand our capability and our presence in industrial end markets. Increasing industrial exposure reinforces the durability of our overall business model and gains us greater access to attractive customer sets for even faster long-term growth. The recurring revenues of ISS, which deliver consistent performance throughout economic cycles, it complements our M&CS and Water Infrastructure businesses, which also benefit from the resilience of utility spending.\nWe've already taken the first steps in offering our combined portfolio to light and general industry customers and we're already targeting attractive industrial verticals such as life sciences and microelectronics. Both have strong long-term outlooks that are driven by secular trends that align well with Xylem's existing business. We look forward to keeping you up to date with our integration progress on a regular basis and anticipate providing a longer-term growth outlook at an Investor Day likely to be scheduled in the first part of 2024.\nNow with that, I'm going to hand it over to Matthew to say a bit more about our end market outlook.\n\nMatthew Francis Pine\n\nSVP and President of Applied Water Systems & Americas Commercial Team, Xylem Inc.\n\nThank you, Patrick. Turning to Slide 14. Before I cover our end market outlook for the year, I want to thank the team and our partners for a great quarter. Our continued outperformance and momentum give us confidence to deliver in 2023 and beyond. We have record backlogs and the value proposition of our differentiated portfolio in attractive end markets puts us in a strong position even in a potentially dynamic macroeconomic environment. We continue to take a balanced approach in our outlook and are monitoring leading indicators watching for signs of moderation. That said, we expect resilient demand in utilities and continued steady growth in industrial water applications.\nAnd now I'll turn to our 2023 outlook by end market, which will be on an organic basis. Utilities, which is approximately 45% of our revenue continue to be healthy and we now expect growth of mid-teens, up from low teens. On the clean water side, we anticipate growth of low 20s, up from high teens previously due to robust demand for our AMI solutions, and backlog execution on improved chip supply. In addition, we are seeing great traction on solution selling with our digital platform and customers are increasingly interested in bundling offerings.\nOn the wastewater side, we continue to expect high single-digit growth, resilient OpEx in developed markets as well as continued CapEx spend in emerging markets will underpin demand.\nTurning now to the industrial end market, which is 45% of our revenue, we expect steady global growth of mid-single digits, but are keeping a close watch for signs of moderation. We expect any softness from developed markets to be somewhat offset by growth in emerging markets including China, where industrial momentum has continued to outpace utilities.\nLastly, in building solutions, which is about 10% of our revenue, we expect growth of mid-single digits, driven by steady replacement business and backlog execution. The overall demand outlook remains healthy. And although we are not including Evoqua in our organic outlook, we expect the contribution of mission-critical solutions and services in attractive high-growth verticals such as life sciences and microelectronics to further increase the durability of our business. That outlook, combined with our operating discipline, commercial momentum and large backlogs gives us confidence for the rest of the year and beyond.\nNow I'll turn it over to Sandy to walk you through the detail of our raised guidance.\n\nSandra E. Rowland\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Xylem Inc.\n\nThank you, Matthew. Turning to Slide 15. We are increasing our full year guidance across revenue, EBITDA and EPS and also incorporating Evoqua. I want to take a moment to walk you through the puts and takes of how we now see the full year.\nWe expect total revenues to be around $7.2 billion for the year, which includes approximately $1.1 billion from Evoqua and another increase in our organic revenue guidance. We now expect full year organic revenue growth of 9% to 10%, up from 8% to 9%. We are raising the low end of our EBITDA guidance to about 18%. And in addition, we are lifting full year adjusted EPS guidance to $3.50 to $3.70, up approximately $0.35 at the midpoint. This incorporates a $0.15 raise from our strong organic outlook and a $0.20 increase due to acquisition-related adjustments. This includes a contribution from Evoqua of approximately $0.45, the add back of legacy purchase accounting intangible amortization of $0.30 and partially offset by incremental share dilution of about $0.55.\nAs Patrick highlighted, we've made great progress on integration. We expect to be at $40 million of run rate cost synergies by the end of the year and we remain on track to deliver $140 million of run rate cost synergies within 3 years.\nTurning to Slide 16. For 2023, our organic revenue growth by segment breaks down as follows: approximately 20% growth in M&CS, high single-digits growth in Water Infrastructure and mid-single-digit growth in Applied Water and we are still on track to achieve free cash flow conversion of at least 100% of net income.\nWe've also provided you with a number of other full year assumptions in the appendix on Slide 21. And now drilling down in the third quarter, we anticipate total company growth will be in the range of 40% to 45% on a reported basis and 4% to 6% organically.\nBy segment, we expect revenue growth to be in the high teens in M&CS and mid-single digits in Water Infrastructure and remained flat in Applied Water. We expect third quarter EBITDA margin to be approximately 18%, driven by higher volumes, continued price realization and productivity gains. And with that, please turn to Slide 17, and I'll turn the call back over to Patrick for closing comments.\n\nPatrick K. Decker\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Xylem, Inc.\n\nThanks, Sandy. We've covered a lot here. So we look forward to your questions. But just before we do that, I want to reiterate a fundamental point. This is a transformational step forward for Xylem, and we believe it is transformational for our customers and our communities. We are very excited about this strategic evolution, but the most important things about Xylem are not changing.\nOur investment thesis is one of those unchanging constants. We are creating significant economic and social value with a durable business model that addresses intensifying water challenges. And we're doing that with a differentiated portfolio of solutions and services in attractive and growing end markets. This gives us a multiyear runway of profitable growth with sustainable margin expansion on the foundations of a strong balance sheet and cash generation with capital deployment to further strengthen our portfolio.\nIt has become increasingly apparent that the need for solutions to the world's water challenges is only growing, and we are in a very privileged position to serve those needs. So now we look forward to taking your questions. So operator, let me turn the call back over to you for Q&A."

Now please turn to Slide 4, and I'll turn the call over to our CEO, Patrick Decker.\n\nPatrick K. Decker\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Xylem Inc.\n\nThanks, Andrea, and good morning, everyone. As we indicated in our press release, the team delivered a very strong operational performance in the fourth quarter, exceeding our expectations across each segment and region. Resilient demand and strong backlog execution delivered 20% revenue growth for the quarter and healthy EBITDA margin expansion. That performance continued and built upon the team's solid delivery through the year, fueling healthy momentum coming into 2023.\nOn a full year basis, revenue grew 11% and earnings per share grew 14%. Water Infrastructure grew 15% in the quarter on robust utilities and industrial demand in the U.S. and Western Europe, and the segment was up 12% for the full year. M&CS posted very strong fourth quarter performance. This segment was up 35% in the quarter on backlog execution from improved chip supply and continued strong demand, bringing full year growth to 8%. Applied Water grew 17% in the quarter and finished 2022 with 14% growth for the full year.\nOverall, higher volumes and positive price cost performance drove significant EBITDA margin expansion in the quarter, up 250 basis points versus the same period a year ago. The team delivered that growth and margin performance on continuing resilient demand globally. We saw healthy orders growth sequentially. And for the full year, orders were up 4%, demonstrating the durability of our business. I am so proud of the team's performance in serving our customers and of their commitment to our purpose, solving water.\nThe global trends driving investment in water systems continue to intensify. And as today's results demonstrate, we are already very strongly positioned to address them.\nThat said, our recent agreement to acquire Evoqua announced 2 weeks ago, will create a powerful platform to address the world's most critical water challenges with greater capability, depth and scale.\nWe've begun the important work of integration planning to set the combined company up for success and are well into the process of seeking the necessary approvals. Until the deal closes, which we anticipate will be midyear, we remain focused on delivering results to the stakeholders we serve today.\nOn that stand-alone basis, we see continuing resilient demand in our largest end markets, particularly utilities, despite the possibility of macroeconomic softness, execution of our backlogs with ongoing price cost discipline, further supply chain improvements and a return to 100% free cash flow conversion.\nWe expect that this will allow us to deliver 2023 organic revenue growth in the mid-single digits with solid EBITDA margin expansion, resulting in earnings per share between $3 and $3.25, up 10% versus last year at the midpoint of the range.\nWe'll give more color on the outlook and guide in a moment, but first, I'll hand it over to Sandy to dig in briefly on the quarter's results before we look ahead at 2023.\n\nSandra E. Rowland\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Xylem Inc.\n\nThanks, Patrick. Please turn to Slide 5, and I'll cover our fourth quarter results. As Patrick highlighted, the team closed out a strong 2022 with another quarter of robust growth and margin expansion.\nRevenue grew 20% year-over-year, led by 26% growth in the U.S. and mid-teen growth in Western Europe and the emerging markets. In a moment, I'll give you a detailed performance by segment. But in short, utilities was up 24%, with strength in the U.S. driven by chip supply improvements in M&CS, and robust OpEx demand in Water Infrastructure. Industrial grew 15% on particularly strong demand in Western Europe and emerging markets and sustained strength in the U.S.\nCommercial was up 24%, mainly due to continued backlog execution in the U.S. and Western Europe. And residential was up 17%, driven by strength in emerging markets, partially offset by softness in the U.S. Compared to prior year, orders were down 3% in the quarter versus up 23% in the same period last year, but underlying demand remains resilient and in line sequentially.\nWater Infrastructure orders were up 13%, AWS down 6% and M&CS down 19%, following exceptionally high orders last year. However, M&CS orders were in line with the last quarter with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.1x. EBITDA margin was 18.7%, up 250 basis points from the prior year and up 40 basis points sequentially on strong volume and price, which more than offset inflation.\nOur EPS in the quarter was $0.92, up 46% year-over-year. Please turn to Slide 6, and I'll review the quarter's segment performance in a bit more detail. Water Infrastructure outperformed expectations with revenues up 15% in the quarter. Growth was robust across the portfolio, led by our wastewater utility business in the U.S. and industrial strength in emerging markets on continued dewatering demand.\nGeographically, the U.S. was up 26% with solid price realization on strong utilities OpEx demand and continued improvements in the supply chain. Western Europe grew low double digits, driven by healthy industrial activity and emerging markets was also up low double digits, driven by dewatering demand in Latin America and Africa. Orders in the fourth quarter were up 13% with solid dewatering demand in emerging markets and continued utility strength in the U.S.\nEBITDA margin for the segment was up 80 basis points as price, net of inflation and volume conversion more than offset strategic investments.\nPlease turn to Page 7. The Applied Water segment also exceeded expectations with fourth quarter revenues up 17% on strong price realization and backlog execution. Geographically, Western Europe was up over 20%, led by supply chain improvements and strong industrial and commercial demand.\nEmerging Markets was up mid-double digits on strong residential demand in the Middle East and India. The U.S. was up low double digits as supply chain improvements and price realization were partially offset by moderating residential volumes.\nOrders were down 6% in the quarter, with healthy industrial demand in the U.S. and Western Europe, offset by slowing U.S. residential orders. Segment EBITDA margin was up 270 basis points in the quarter. Margin expansion was driven by continued strong price realization, more than offsetting inflation and further supplemented by productivity savings.\nAnd now let's turn to Slide 8, and I'll cover our Measurement & Control Solutions business. M&CS revenue was up 35%, driven by recoveries in chip supply year-over-year and strong project execution in our test and measurement and pipeline assessment services businesses.\nGeographically, all regions were up more than 20%, led by U.S. growth of over 40%. M&CS orders were down 19% in the quarter, lapping a prior year compare of 28% orders growth during the peak of supply chain constraints.\nDemand for our AMI offering remains strong and our $2.1 billion backlog in M&CS is up 14% versus prior year. EBITDA margin for the segment was up 800 basis points versus the prior year and importantly, 130 basis points quarter sequentially. Strong volume conversion, coupled with price realization offsetting inflation, drove the expansion.\nAnd now let's turn to Slide 9 for an overview of cash flows and the company's financial position. In the fourth quarter, we generated free cash flow of $302 million. The team did a great job driving down working capital to hit our previous outlook of 80% free cash flow conversion for the year.\nWhile inventory remains elevated versus where we targeted to be longer term, as there still are pockets of the supply chain that necessitate the extra safety stock that we are carrying, our performance in Q4 gives us confidence in our path to return to 100% conversion in 2023.\nOur financial position remains robust as we exit the year with over $900 million in cash and available liquidity of $1.7 billion. And this is after paying down over $500 million of debt in December.\nNet debt-to-EBITDA leverage is 1.0x.\nPlease turn to Slide 10, and I'll hand back to Patrick to look forward at 2023.\n\nPatrick K. Decker\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Xylem Inc.\n\nThanks, Sandy. The team did an excellent job delivering for our customers and communities in 2022. Their commitment and performance stood out during a tumultuous year of global economic and geopolitical uncertainty; lingering pandemic effects, especially in China; and a challenging supply chain environment. I'm very proud of everything the team achieved, and they are already carrying all that commercial momentum, operational discipline and resilience into 2023.\nAs we look forward, we see continued healthy demand in our major markets despite the possibility of macroeconomic softness in certain sectors of the global economy. We expect that the essential nature of our solutions and the secular trends in water will continue to underpin demand in the attractive, stable end markets that we serve. And we expect to be even better able to serve that demand as supply chain friction continues to ease, and we can progressively work down our $3.6 billion backlogs.\nLooking ahead, we are advancing our strategic delivery of solutions to the acquisition of Evoqua. As I mentioned earlier, and as you would expect, until the deal closes, we are only providing organic guidance for Xylem on a stand-alone basis. But there's no doubt that the combination of Xylem's global utility scale and Evoqua's strength in attractive industrial end markets creates a powerful platform for growth. We expect significant revenue synergies in areas such as cross-selling of our respective utility and industrial portfolios in North America, and growing Evoqua's international exposure via Xylem's global channels and customer relationships.\nNow those are just 2 of the areas where we see tremendous potential to add to the growth of the combined companies and expand our value to customers globally, especially in a number of the most attractive water end markets. But it's not the only inorganic move we're making to give customers more of what they need most. We've also taken a big step forward in helping them adopt the digital solutions they need to increase the resilience of communities essential water infrastructure.\nIn the shadow of our big announcement with Evoqua, another important partnership flew under the radar, one which will accelerate and enhance our ability to deliver more digital solutions to the utility customers around the world.\nLast quarter, we signed an exclusive commercial partnership with Idrica to make adoption of digital technologies easier, faster and more affordable for our utility customers. Headquartered in Valentia, Spain, Idrica is a leader in data in data management and analytics for water utilities. Idrica's GoAigua platform simplifies deployment and operation of new digital capabilities in any water utilities operations. It gives them one secure integrated interface that brings together data capture, analytics and asset and process management onto 1 platform.\nHaving been born out of a utility operator itself, the platform has the advantage of having been built by utility for utilities, and it's already been deployed by over 300 customers around the world.\nUnder the partnership, we will take a minority stake in Idrica and become the exclusive global distributor of their technology. Together, we will enable more utilities to harness the power of connected solutions. We're very excited about it, and we look forward to sharing more as the partnership progresses.\nWe made one other important announcement recently. This one was just before the end of the year, appointing Matthew Pine as Chief Operating Officer. The move ensures that we have continuing focus on operational excellence from an enterprise perspective across all our business segments and regions to continue delivering on our commitment to faster the market revenue growth and margin expansion. At the same time, it's also freed up some of my capacity to deliver on Xylem's strategic evolution and capital deployment.\nIn a moment, we'll turn the call back to Sandy for more detail on our guide. But first, I want to invite Matthew to say a few words on his key areas of focus in the new role and provide some color on our end market outlook. Matthew?\n\nMatthew Francis Pine\n\nCOO, Xylem Inc.\n\nThanks, Patrick. We are very strongly positioned on intensifying trends with technology leadership in a large and growing installed base in attractive end markets.\nMy focus as Chief Operating Officer is to further accelerate profitable growth and maximize the value we deliver to customers and communities around the world. Across the business, we continue to remove complexity, increase our local agility and unlock further scale efficiencies. This is all aimed, of course, at better serving our customers at the same time we deliver continuing margin expansion. We're driving this margin focus across the enterprise, taking particular aim at even more enhanced productivity and customer satisfaction.\nFor example, in the M&CS segment, improvements in chip supply enabled us to build momentum, delivering the accretive backlog, we deploy resources back to productivity as well as new product introductions from innovation. Secondly, we continue to enhance our digital portfolio, as Patrick covered. Our customers need simple, integrated digital technologies that solve their problems cost effectively. Our portfolio increasingly meets that demand with attractive growth and margin profiles.\nLastly, our customers depend on Xylem as a trusted partner to deliver ongoing support. So our third operational focus is in standardizing our solutions and creating new offerings. This will take us deeper into our installed base with aftermarket sales and services. New offerings such as outcome-based solutions and condition-based maintenance will enable us to capture demand, address customers' needs and expand reoccurring revenues.\nIt's no accident that there's a theme running through all 3 of these priorities. Each is about growing revenues and improving our margins by serving our customers better more thoroughly and more simply, making it even easier for them to do business with us and solve more of their challenges.\nWhen we talk about being in a privileged position, that's not mentally to refer to our strategic or market positioning. It also reflects our view that we are fortunate to work alongside the kind of customers that we do, partner with them to solve their critical water challenges they face. It's a privilege and also a great opportunity for continuing value creation from our shareholders, communities and all stakeholders.\nNow let's turn to Slide 11, and I'll walk you through our end market outlook. We expect underlying demand and most of our end markets will continue to be healthy through 2023.\nWe've taken a balanced view based on the strength of our backlog, critical nature of our largest end markets, and the continued value proposition of our differentiated products. We anticipate our utility business overall, which is our largest end market, will grow high single digits in 2023.\nOn the wastewater side, we expect mid-single-digit growth as we see a continuation of steady global demand. We anticipate resilient OpEx demand in developed markets due to the critical nature of our offerings as well as the benefit of continued CapEx spend in emerging markets. The outlook for longer-term capital project spending and bid activity remains robust.\nOn the clean water side, we anticipate revenues being up low teens. This growth is driven by continued robust demand for our AMI solutions and expected improvements in chip supply through 2023, allowing for significant large deal deployments already secured in our backlog. We foresee healthy momentum in our test and measurement and our pipeline assessment service businesses due to increased focus on infrastructure and climate challenges.\nLooking at the industrial end market, we expect to go low to mid-single digits on steady demand for our solutions globally. We continue to see strong growth in dewatering due to mining demand in emerging markets and the benefits of our strategic investments in our U.S. and European dewatering business.\nThe commercial end market should deliver low single-digit growth on solid replacement business and backlog execution, partially offset by moderation in new construction.\nIn residential, our smallest end market, we are expecting low single-digit decline due to normalizing demand in the U.S., partially offset by continued strength in emerging markets. In both commercial and residential, we would expect moderation to emerge in the second half results as we continue to work through the backlog in the first half of 2023.\nNow I'll turn it over to Sandy to walk you through our updated guidance.\n\nSandra E. Rowland\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Xylem Inc.\n\nThank you, Matthew. Turning to Slide 12. As mentioned, we expect Evoqua to join us in mid-2023. Until then, our full year guidance is on an organic basis and excludes the combination of the 2 companies. For Xylem overall, we foresee full year 2023 revenue growth in the range of 4% to 6%. This breaks down by segment as follows: mid-single-digit growth in Water Infrastructure with solid growth in both wastewater utilities and industrial; low single-digit growth in Applied Water from growth in industrial and commercial, partially offset by residential; We expect Measurement & Control Solutions to be up low teens. For 2023, we expect EBITDA to be in the range of 17.5% to 18%. This represents a 50 to 100 basis point margin expansion versus prior year. And this yields an EPS range of $3 to $3.25, up 10% at the midpoint over the prior year.\nFree cash flow conversion is expected to be 100% of net income. In addition, today, we announced an increase in our annual dividend of 10%, aligned with our capital allocation framework to grow dividends in line with earnings. We've also provided you with a number of other full year assumptions in the slide to supplement your models. We're assuming a euro-to-dollar conversion rate of 1.08 and a foreign exchange can be volatile, our FX sensitivity table is included in the appendix.\nAnd now drilling down on the first quarter, we anticipate total company revenues will be in the range of 7% to 9% growth. By segment, we expect high single-digit growth in Water Infrastructure, low single digits in Applied Water and high teens growth for M&CS. We expect first quarter EBITDA margin to be approximately 16%, driven by higher volumes and more favorable price cost dynamics. And with that, please turn to Slide 13, and I'll turn the call back over to Patrick for closing comments.\n\nPatrick K. Decker\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Xylem Inc.\n\nThanks, Sandy. We're coming into 2023, very strongly positioned. Our end markets continue to show resilient underlying demand. We're confident in delivering mid-single-digit revenue growth and strong margin expansion and the team continues to outperform on strong operational and commercial execution.\nBeyond 2023, we remain well on track to deliver our longer-term strategic and financial milestones. We are very excited about all of the combination of Xylem and Evoqua will offer towards the creation of a more water secure, resilient and sustainable world, while driving value for our shareholders by accelerating growth and scale.\nThe integration team met last week at our headquarters in D.C. The first of many meetings to set us up for success on day 1. And last week, I traveled with Ron Keating, Evoqua's CEO, to a number of their key sites to spend time with their incredibly talented people. Those visits only heighten my appreciation of the potential opportunities ahead and confirm the strong strategic and cultural fit of our 2 companies.\nWe've also taken the next step in the regulatory process, having submitted the required filings here in the U.S. and progressing toward filings in the relevant international jurisdictions. We continue to anticipate the deal closing midyear. A great deal of opportunity will open up when we bring our 2 companies together.\nDuring our next earnings call, we will provide an update on our progress. Meanwhile, our business remains squarely focused on delivering on our 2023 financial commitments and continuing our commercial momentum and execution. Now operator, I'll turn the call back over to you for questions."

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Andrea van der Berg, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nAndrea van der Berg\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Xylem's First Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. With me today are Chief Executive Officer, Patrick Decker; Chief Financial Officer, Sandy Rowland, and Chief Operating Officer, Matthew Pine. They will provide their perspective on Xylem's first quarter 2023 results and discuss the second quarter and full year outlook.\nFollowing our prepared remarks, we will address questions related to the information covered on the call. I'll ask that you please keep to one question and a follow-up and then return to the queue.\nAs a reminder, this call and our webcast are accompanied by a slide presentation available in the Investors section of our website, www.xylem.com. A replay of today's call will be available until midnight, May 11. Please note the replay number +1 (800) 925-9354 or +1 (402) 220-5384. Additionally, the call will be available for playback via the Investors section of our website under the heading Investor Events. Please turn to Slide 2.\nWe will make some forward-looking statements on today's call, including references to future events or developments that we anticipate will or may occur in the future. These statements are subject to future risks and uncertainties, such as those factors described in Xylem's most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the SEC.\nPlease note that the company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements publicly to reflect subsequent events or circumstances, and actual events or results could differ materially from those anticipated.\nPlease turn to Slide 3. We have provided you with a summary of our key performance metrics, including both GAAP and non-GAAP metrics. For purposes of today's call, all references will be on an organic and/or adjusted basis, unless otherwise indicated. Now GAAP financials have been reconciled for you and are included in the Appendix section of the presentation. Now please turn to Slide 4, and I will turn the call over to our CEO, Patrick Decker.\n\nPatrick K. Decker\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Xylem, Inc.\n\nThanks, Andrea, and good morning, everyone. As we indicated in our press release this morning, the team delivered very strong operational performance in the first quarter, exceeding our expectations on revenue, margin and earnings per share.\nRevenue grew 17% and Earnings per share was up 53%, and we delivered significant EBITDA margin expansion driven by volume growth on modest supply chain improvements, productivity and operating efficiency as well as a healthy price/cost mix.\nWe saw backlog growth of 8% alongside double-digit organic revenue growth in utilities, industrial and commercial. And growth across all regions, most notably the U.S., Western Europe and key emerging markets such as Africa, Latin America and China. The team came into the year with good momentum and is capitalized on supply chain improvements and our competitive position to secure customer advantages and convert our backlog. The results reflect resilient underlying demand as evidenced by sequential orders growth in each segment, our very healthy $3.7 billion backlog and a book-to-bill ratio greater than 1 in each segment.\nGiven the team's operating discipline, the continued demand for our solutions and the intensifying long-term secular trends in water, we are confident about our momentum and growth outlook.\nSo based on that, we're raising our full year organic revenue guidance to high single digits from mid-single digits and we're raising our EPS guide. Of course, we'll continue to monitor demand trends given some macro uncertainty in the broader economy, especially for the second half of the year but we remain confident in our position for the remainder of the year and beyond.\nAlongside this quarter's performance, we've also made great progress towards the combination of Xylem and Evoqua. Integration planning is well advanced and all necessary approval processes are moving ahead as planned. We continue to expect the transaction to close by midyear. We'll give more color on the Evoqua culmination in a moment as well as more detail on our outlook, end markets and regions. But first, let me now hand it over to Sandy to review the quarter's results.\n\nSandra E. Rowland\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Xylem Inc.\n\nThanks, Patrick. Please turn to Slide 5, and I'll cover our first quarter results. As Patrick highlighted, the team built on our momentum coming into 2023 with another healthy quarter of growth and margin expansion. Revenue grew 17% year-over-year, led by double-digit growth in the U.S. and Western Europe and high single-digit growth in emerging markets. In a moment, we'll look at detailed performance by segment, but in short, each segment grew double digits and exceeded our expectations.\nUtilities, our largest end market, was up 23% with strength in the U.S. driven by continued chip supply improvements in M&CS as well as price and robust OpEx demand in water infrastructure.\nIndustrial, which is approximately 35% of revenues grew 13% with strong price realization and solid demand across all regions, particularly in Western Europe.\nCommercial, which is approximately 10% of our revenues, was up 16%, mainly due to continued backlog execution in the U.S.\nIn Residential, our smallest end market, with approximately 5% of revenues, was modestly [ down ]. Orders performance overall was better than expected and underlying demand remains resilient.\nM&CS was down 17% due to unusually high orders growth of 25% last year as a function of supply chain lead times. Water Infrastructure orders were up 1% and AWS was down 1%. EBITDA margin was 16.3%, up 210 basis points from the prior year on higher volumes and favorable price cost dynamics. Our EPS in the quarter was $0.72, up 53% year-over-year. Please turn to Slide 6, and I'll review the quarter's performance by segment in a bit more detail.\nM&CS revenue was up 32%, driven by better-than-expected recovery in chip supply. We saw double-digit growth, not only in metrology, but across our M&CS businesses, including test and measurement and pipeline assessment services. There was strong performance across all regions led by U.S. growth of over 40%. As mentioned, M&CS orders were down in the quarter, but up sequentially.\nDemand for our AMI offerings remains healthy and our $2.1 billion backlog in M&CS is up 8% versus the prior year. EBITDA margin for the segment was up 690 basis points versus the prior year on strong incrementals. Robust volume conversion, price realization and productivity drove the expansion, more than offsetting inflation and unfavorable mix. And now let's turn to Slide 7, and I'll cover our Water Infrastructure business.\nWater Infrastructure revenues were up 15% versus our guide of high single digits due to better price realization globally and stronger-than-expected demand in emerging markets. Growth exceeded our expectations across the portfolio with revenues up double digits in all regions and end markets. Geographically, the U.S. was up 22%, with strong price realization on utilities OpEx demand and backlog execution. Western Europe grew 10% with robust demand in utilities and industrial. Emerging markets was also up low double digits, driven by strong OpEx demand in Latin America, Africa and China.\nOrders in the quarter were up sequentially and up 1% year-over-year versus double-digit growth last year. EBITDA margin for the segment was down 80 basis points, primarily due to unfavorable mix and strategic investments in digital and solutions selling, partially offset by favorable price cost dynamics. And please turn to Slide 8 for an overview of AWS.\nApplied Water revenues grew 10% on strong price realization and improved supply chain. Geographically, Western Europe was up 17% due to backlog execution and healthy industrial and commercial demand. The U.S. was up 10%, driven by backlog execution and strong price realization, particularly in the commercial market. Emerging markets was down low single digits, primarily due to lapping double-digit growth last year in the Middle East and Eastern Europe. And while orders were down 1% in the quarter, they were stronger than expected and notably, book-to-bill was greater than 1.\nSegment EBITDA margin was up 480 basis points in the quarter, driven by continued strong price realization and productivity, more than offsetting inflation. And now let's turn to Slide 9 for an overview of cash flows and the company's financial position.\nOur financial position remains robust as we exit the quarter with over $800 million in cash and available liquidity of $1.8 billion. Net debt-to-EBITDA leverage is 1x. Due to seasonality, free cash flow was negative in the quarter, but came in better than expected. While supply chain challenges are not yet behind us, we've made significant progress on working capital and we remain confident in our full year guidance of 100% conversion. Please turn to Slide 10, and I'll hand it back to Patrick.\n\nPatrick K. Decker\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Xylem, Inc.\n\nThanks, Sandy. Although it's still early in the year, we look forward with the confidence. We have strong momentum coming out of the first quarter, thanks to the team's continued operating discipline and resilient market demand. We'll be even better positioned for growth as we combine Xylem's market-leading portfolio with Evoqua's capabilities and presence in very attractive industrial end markets. And global trends are continuing to drive increasing investment in addressing critical water challenges, reinforcing the foundation of our long-term strategy.\nWhile we've been ensuring our team remains focused on meeting customer needs, winning in the marketplace and delivering on operational execution, we've also been preparing for our upcoming combination with Evoqua, which positions us even more favorably for the next phase of Xylem's growth.\nAs water risk rise in global importance, the combination of these 2 companies creates a transformative platform for solving customer's and communities' most critical water challenges at scale. As we said in January, the deal economics prove out on cost synergies alone. But more importantly, the combined company is positioned for very attractive growth, increasing recurring and resilient revenues and significant margin expansion opportunities in addition to the foundational cost synergies.\nOn top of this, the combination is supported by a robust financial position and an even stronger balance sheet which preserves our optionality for the future. Since our January announcement of the transaction, an integration planning team comprising of senior staff from both companies has been working to set the company up for success. The integration is rooted in 4 simple principles: first, avoid distraction and deliver our 2023 plans; second, deliver on committed revenue and cost synergies; third, retain, motivate and develop key talent from each company; and lastly, bring the best of both cultures to the combined company.\nAs we advance in the integration process, our confidence and excitement about the synergy potential of the combination continues to grow. And I'm sure many of you have seen Evoqua's second quarter results announced just 2 days ago. Based on their earnings release, it's clear both Xylem and Evoqua have strong momentum. We're remaining focused on serving our customers and delivering on our respective plans for the year.\nIn addition to a solid quarter and confident outlook for the year, we also continue to see evidence of the intensifying secular trends at the foundation of our strategy. In March, the United Nations held its first water conference in over 40 years. It's one of many indicators of the global shift and attention to water and the focus on water's role in sustainable development. Xylem's delegation engaged with government leaders and development agencies from around the world, particularly on the role of technology and innovation and improving water security.\nDespite the different worlds of the private sector, government and NGOs often in habit, sustainability is a powerful common language. For example, there was considerable discussion at the conference about water management and greenhouse gas emissions as water management drives roughly 10% of emissions globally. It's a particular focus in our work with customers, helping them reduce their emissions. And as you'll see in our 2022 sustainability report to be released this month, we've enabled customers to significantly reduce their CO2 footprint, achieving that specific Xylem 2025 sustainability goal well ahead of plan. That's a meaningful step, but there's a long way to go in decarbonizing the water sector more broadly.\nFortunately, we are in the privileged position of helping customers achieve their net zero carbon goals by deploying more efficient technologies that reduce emissions and their operating costs, ultimately making water more affordable for our communities. That is work that we're both purpose-driven and commercially motivated to do.\nOur sustainability report also details the progress we've made across the full suite of our 2025 sustainability goals. And I invite each and every one of you to give it your full attention when it's released in the coming days. Now with that, I'll turn it over to Matthew to provide a view on our end market outlook.\n\nMatthew Francis Pine\n\nSVP and President of Applied Water Systems & Americas Commercial Team, Xylem Inc.\n\nThank you, Patrick. Before I dive into the end market outlook, I want to congratulate the team on a great quarter. We exceeded our expectations across the board and made great progress on productivity initiatives, leading to healthy margin expansion. Overall, we are well positioned to continue building on this momentum through the rest of the year.\nLooking ahead, we have taken a balanced approach in our outlook given the dynamics of the macroeconomic environment. Our backlogs are strong and underlying demand in our largest end markets continues to be resilient, providing confidence to raise our 2023 guide. That said, we are closely monitoring leading indicators in some of our more cyclical businesses, particularly in developed markets. We expect continued steady demand in emerging markets and are optimistic about a gradual recovery in China through the rest of the year.\nUtilities, which makes up the largest end market continues to be healthy, and we now expect growth in low teens in 2023, up from high single digits. On the wastewater side, we expect high single-digit growth up from mid-single-digit growth. We expect OpEx strength in developed markets as well as continued CapEx spend in emerging markets will result in steady global demand.\nOn the clean water side, we anticipate growth of high teens up from low teens. This increase in our outlook is driven by continued robust demand for our AMI solutions and earlier improvements in chip supply through 2023 as seen in quarter 1, allowing for backlog execution.\nWe continue to foresee healthy momentum in our test and measurement and our pipeline assessment service businesses due to increasing focus on infrastructure and climate challenges. We are also seeing early benefits from the unification of our commercial team in the Americas. The team has made great progress in solution selling to our utility customers, bringing the best of Xylem's offerings to bear solving our customers' highest value challenges.\nLooking at the industrial end market, we expect to grow mid-single digits on steady demand for solutions globally. While U.S. industrial production estimates point to potential softening in the back half of 2023, we expect that to be offset by growth in emerging markets and were supported by our backlog. In addition, our dewatering business continues to see strong demand from mining in emerging markets, particularly in Latin America and is benefiting from strategic investments we've made in our fleet.\nMoving on to commercial. Given Q1 outperformance, we now expect mid-single-digit growth, up from low single digits. We anticipate continued growth driven by solid replacement business and backlog execution, partially offset by new construction. We would expect the moderation to emerge in the second half results and are monitoring the [ ABI ] institutional index and other indicators closely.\nIn residential, our smallest end market, we continue to expect a low single-digit decline due to normalizing demand in the U.S., partially offset by continued resilience in emerging markets. Overall, we feel confident about the resiliency of demand given our backlog and healthy orders momentum. Now I'll turn it over to Sandy to walk you through our updated guidance.\n\nSandra E. Rowland\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Xylem Inc.\n\nThank you, Matthew. Turning to Slide 12. As a reminder, our guidance is on a stand-alone basis and excludes the combination with Evoqua. As Patrick mentioned, we are increasing our full year guidance for organic revenue growth and adjusted EPS. We are raising our full year organic revenue growth to 8% to 9%, up from 4% to 6%. This increase is driven primarily by stronger price realization and earlier-than-expected supply chain improvements in the year.\nIn addition, we are lifting our full year adjusted EPS guidance to $3.15 to $3.35, up from $3 to $3.25. The revised guidance breaks down by segment as follows: high teens growth in M&CS versus previous guidance of low teens, high single-digit growth in Water Infrastructure, up from mid-single-digit growth with solid growth in both wastewater utilities and industrial and mid-single-digit growth in Applied Water, up from low single digits with growth in industrial and commercial, partially offset by residential.\nFor 2023, our EBITDA guidance is 17.5% to 18%. And as mentioned, this yields an adjusted EPS range of $3.15 to $3.35. We still expect free cash flow conversion to be 100% of net income. And we've also provided you with a number of other full year assumptions on the slide to supplement your model.\nAnd now drilling down on the second quarter, we anticipate total company revenues will be in the range of 10% to 11% organic growth. By segment, we expect high teens growth for M&CS and high single-digit growth in both Water Infrastructure and Applied Water. We expect second quarter EBITDA margin to be in the range of 17.5% to 18% which represents over 100 basis points of improvement versus the prior year, driven by higher volumes and continued price realization and productivity gains. And with that, turn to Slide 13, and I'll turn the call back over to Patrick for closing comments.\n\nPatrick K. Decker\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Xylem, Inc.\n\nThanks, Sandy. I'm very proud of the team's performance demonstrating continuing dedication to serving our customers and communities and delivering very strong results. Looking ahead, we're focused on continuing that momentum while also executing a successful integration of Evoqua once the deal closes. We look forward to updating you on that combination in our next earnings call when I anticipate we will be presenting the performance, outlook and opportunity of our combined company. Now operator, I'll turn the call back over to you for questions."

(Operator Instructions)\nI would now like to turn the call over to Matt Latino, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nMatthew Latino\n\nDirector of IR, Xylem Inc.\n\nThank you, Ashley. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Xylem's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. With me today are Chief Executive Officer, Patrick Decker; and Chief Financial Officer, Sandy Rowland. They will provide their perspective on Xylem's first quarter 2022 results and discuss the second quarter and full year outlook. Following our prepared remarks, we will address questions related to the information covered on the call. (Operator Instructions)\nAs a reminder, this call and our webcast are accompanied by a slide presentation available in the Investors section of our website at www.xylem.com. A replay of today's call will be available until midnight on May 11. Please note that replay number is 1 (800) 934-5153 or 1 (402) 220-1182.\nPlease turn to Slide 2. We will make some forward-looking statements on today's call, including references to future events or developments that we anticipate will or may occur in the future. These statements are subject to future risks and uncertainties, such as those factors described in Xylem's most recent annual report on Form 10-K and in subsequent reports filed with the SEC. Please note that the company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements publicly to reflect subsequent events or circumstances and actual events or results could differ materially from those anticipated.\nWe have provided you with a number of -- with a summary of our key performance metrics, including both GAAP and non-GAAP metrics in the appendix. For purposes of today's call, all references will be on an adjusted basis unless otherwise indicated, and non-GAAP financials have been reconciled for you and are also included in the appendix section of the presentation.\nNow please turn to Slide 3, and I will turn the call over to our CEO, Patrick Decker.\n\nPatrick K. Decker\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Xylem Inc.\n\nThanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. The team came into 2022 with strong momentum, and they've taken full advantage of robust underlying demand around the world to deliver our first quarter operational results above expectations.\nRevenues grew 4% organically, surpassing our guidance. Despite ongoing chip shortages constraining our utilities business, supply is slowly improving, which is reflected in quarter sequential revenue growth and EBITDA margin expansion in our metrology business.\nRevenue strength was also broad-based globally. We saw healthy growth in every region, excluding China, given the COVID impact there. Western Europe was a standout, delivering 10% growth in the quarter.\nBut the robust global demand for our offering comes through most clearly in the pace of order intake. Orders were up 14% for the quarter, with record order bookings in every segment. M&CS at the fastest pace with a 25% order surge, as the value proposition of digital technologies continues to fuel demand.\nOrders performance across the portfolio pushed our already healthy backlogs to 50% growth year-on-year. EBITDA margin performance was also above our previous guidance due to strong price realization, which mitigated much of the inflationary pressure, while at the same time, we continue to drive productivity and further simplification throughout the business. As a result of that good work from the team, we delivered EPS of $0.47, again, above our expectations.\nThe quarter did present some fresh challenges. China's ongoing response to COVID is having significant impact on our business, and it will have flow-on effects for some time in the global supply chain. And while our European business delivered exceptional revenue growth, the euro rate began to move unfavorably.\nSo conditions are dynamic. But the quarter's operational results show that the team is doing an excellent job, navigating the challenges and managing what it can control on a global basis.\nLooking ahead, we're in a very strong position as structural demand continues to be robust in all end markets and regions. And we have market leadership in the categories where demand is greatest, especially in digitally enabled solutions. So we are raising our guidance for the year, and are on track to deliver the longer-term growth and strategic milestones we laid out at our Investor Day last fall.\nBefore turning over to Sandy for performance detail by segment, I want to mention how proud I am with the Xylem team and of our partners for their response to the war in Ukraine. When the war broke out, the Xylem team stepped up right away to provide for the safety and well-being of all of our Ukrainian colleagues and their families. Similarly, our team has shown extraordinary support by raising money for the humanitarian relief work of our NGO partners, whose activities include providing essential water and sanitation services, both in Ukraine and to refugees. It's become one of our most successful mass giving campaigns ever, and I could not be prouder of the team.\nNow I'll hand over to Sandy to review the quarter's results by segment.\n\nSandra E. Rowland\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Xylem Inc.\n\nThanks, Patrick. Please turn to Slide 4, and I'll give some additional color on our first quarter results. Given the quarter's challenges, the team did a great job delivering on our commitments with particularly strong performance on price and backlog execution. Revenue growth was healthy in all regions, led by a double-digit result in Western Europe and mid-single-digit gains in the U.S. In emerging markets, revenues grew high single digits excluding China, which was affected by COVID shutdowns.\nIn a moment, I'll offer detailed performance by segment. But in short, utilities was down 3%. Strength in Western Europe was offset by ongoing chip supply constraints and their outsized impact on our smart metering business in the U.S. Industrial grew 10% on increasing activity in all geographies, excluding China, with particular strength in Western Europe. Commercial was up 11%, led by healthy growth in the U.S., and residential was up 15%, also driven by the U.S. Organic orders were up 14% in the quarter. As Patrick mentioned, the quarter set historically high order intake with robust demand for our technologies across all segments.\nEBITDA margin was 14.2%, which was above our guided range, primarily driven by stronger-than-expected price realization. Year-over-year EBITDA margin contracted 290 basis points. We got healthy price realization and productivity benefits, but they were more than offset by inflation, and lower volumes from chip shortages impacting our higher-margin smart metering solutions. As previously mentioned, we'll continue to offset inflation with progressive price realization. Our EPS in the quarter was $0.47.\nPlease turn to Slide 5, and I'll review the quarter's segment performance in a bit more detail. Water Infrastructure orders in the quarter were up 12% organically versus last year, with growth underpinned by sustained demand in our wastewater utility business in the U.S. and Western Europe and increasing demand for dewatering, particularly in emerging markets.\nWater Infrastructure revenue was up 8% in the quarter. Industrial remained strong, and we saw revenue acceleration in our U.S. wastewater utility business as prior quarter order-to-revenue conversion delays eased.\nGeographically, results were mixed for the segment. The U.S. and Western Europe were up mid-double digits driven by treatment deliveries in the U.S. and healthy utility OpEx in both regions. Emerging markets was down low double digits due to a challenging prior year compare in China and impacts from the recent COVID lockdown. EBITDA margin for the segment was down 140 basis points, a strong price realization and productivity benefits were more than offset by inflation and investments.\nPlease turn to Page 6. In the Applied Water segment, first quarter orders were up 8% organically, led by price and underlying global demand. Revenues increased 10% on strong backlog execution across all end markets, along with solid price realization.\nGeographically, the U.S. was up mid-double digits. All end markets showed strength, and we benefited from the traction of new product launches. Western Europe delivered high single-digit growth with healthy gains across all end markets, and increased activity in large industrial accounts.\nEmerging Markets was up mid-single digits on backlog execution and activity. Segment EBITDA margin declined 380 basis points in the quarter. Similar to Water Infrastructure, we delivered solid price realization and productivity benefits, but they were more than offset by inflation.\nAnd now let's turn to Slide 7, and I'll cover our Measurement & Control Solutions business. M&CS orders grew 25% organically in the quarter, reflecting continued strong demand for our metrology solutions as well as healthy demand in pipeline assessment services.\nWhile a portion of our M&CS backlog includes orders that have been delayed due to chip shortages, our M&CS backlog is up 60% versus the prior year. It is now more than $2 billion. As we anticipated, revenue declined 9% due to constrained chip supply. We are encouraged by the gradual improvement in availability, and we realized significant quarter sequential gains. It's worth noting that the growing metrology backlog is both margin accretive and resilient. There have been no cancellations of AMI awards.\nGeographically, Western Europe and Emerging Markets were flat with some growth from our pipeline assessment services business. Chip shortages pressed U.S. revenues down 14%. Segment EBITDA margin in the quarter was down 470 basis points compared to the prior year, but higher than last quarter. As we've noted in previous calls, the business gets very strong operating leverage from higher volumes and revenues, and those are still being held back by the supply-constrained conversion of orders. We were able to partially offset those effects with price and productivity gains.\nAnd now let's turn to Slide 8 for an overview of cash flows and our balance sheet. Consistent with typical seasonality patterns, we used cash in the first quarter. This year, we also strategically increased safety stocks to mitigate supply chain volatility and are carrying higher inventory balances.\nOur financial position remains robust with $1.1 billion in cash and available liquidity of approximately $1.9 billion. Net debt-to-EBITDA leverage is 1.5x.\nAnd please turn to Slide 9, and I'll hand the call back over to Patrick to look forward at the rest of the year.\n\nPatrick K. Decker\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Xylem Inc.\n\nThanks, Sandy. We'll turn to detailed guidance in a moment, but as I mentioned, we are increasing our revenue outlook due to continued strong demand and higher price realization. We're also raising the bottom end of our EPS guidance by $0.05, despite increasing foreign exchange headwinds.\nThe team is demonstrating that we are able to use our market leadership to drive price while holding and in many cases, even gaining share as reflected in the level of our order growth trends and expanding backlogs.\nIn fact, I want to give a big shout out to the team, including our channel and distribution partners for doing such a great job making sure our pricing moderated the effects of inflation. We also continue to foresee chip supply playing out much as we anticipated. We've had improved supply this quarter, and we expect that trend to continue in each successive quarter through the year.\nSupply of chips remains well below our current needs and is expected to remain that way through at least early 2023. Yet, our team, along with our most critical suppliers and our customers continue to navigate the challenge and maintain current backlog while still winning new business.\nWith our ability to capture price on surging demand and with progressive order-to-revenue conversion, we're confident in lifting our full year guidance. Inflation will continue to be a significant factor, of course, so we will keep driving further price realization as appropriate.\nIn just a moment, you'll see we've significantly modified our euro exchange assumptions, and that will have a moderating impact on our reported EPS, but we expect the team will be able to cover the majority of those headwinds operationally. Sandy will give more color on that at a segment level in a few minutes. But the overall picture is more positive than we previously anticipated for the year and puts us squarely on track to deliver our longer-term growth and strategic milestones.\nWhen we laid out those milestones, we also detailed the strategic pillars that would enable us to deliver them. They included making it easier for customers to do business with us, making it easier for our colleagues to serve them and continuing to reduce business complexity. So today, alongside our quarterly results, we've announced that we are further unifying and simplifying our segment and regional leadership.\nSince the acquisitions that created our M&CS segment, we maintained a separate commercial interface to utility customers. This was necessary for some time to create a strong and focused new offering from Xylem, which has proven successful in achieving record deal wins and backlog.\nNow we believe we have the opportunity to move to the next phase of our journey in building a single platform, one that leverages the market-leading breadth of our portfolio and makes it easier for customers to access it. We've previously done that across the rest of the world, except North America. So today, we announce that we are moving to one interface for our customers across the Americas as well.\nWe are integrating and unifying the leadership of the Americas commercial team. They will report to Matthew Pine, who will also now assume leadership of both the AWS and M&CS segments.\nIn Europe, Hayati Yarkadas continues to lead commercial operations as well as the Water Infrastructure segment and will now lead the build-out of Xylem services offering globally. And Franz Cerwinka will continue to lead commercial operations across the emerging markets.\nAs a result of the changes we've announced today, Colin Sabol will leave Xylem after a transition period during which he will focus on a smooth leadership handover and provide advisory support to me and the leadership team. Most of you know, Colin. And you know he has been a stalwart contributor to Xylem's growth story since the beginning. In his 16 years with the company, both with Xylem and our predecessor, ITT, his insight has been at the center of our strategic vision. His leadership has contributed to our emergence as a market leader in digital technologies as our M&CS orders growth shows, and I am profoundly grateful to have benefited from his considerable talent and unwavering commitment. We will miss him at the leadership table and our colleagues will miss him as a leader.\nTurning to sustainability. Our growth framework emphasizes the creation of both economic and social value. Our performance on social value creation is highlighted in our annual sustainability report, which we'll publish later this month.\nI won't steal too much of this thunder, but I am happy to share that Xylem is well ahead of schedule in reducing carbon emissions. Since 2019, we reduced our greenhouse gas intensity by 12%, across Scope 1 and 2 emissions. We've also driven our own water use down by more than 20% and doubled our rate of water recycling versus just 3 years ago.\nThe rigor and transparency of our reporting reflect our commitment to accountability as a sustainability leader. So I invite you to dig into the report when it comes out because sustainability is so fundamental to our strategic differentiation, to our investment thesis and to our growth.\nNow I'll turn it back over to Sandy for more color on our outlook and guide.\n\nSandra E. Rowland\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Xylem Inc.\n\nThanks, Patrick. Consistent with our previous presentations, we have provided key facts for each end market in the appendix. We expect healthy underlying demand will continue through the remainder of the year with modestly better volumes and stronger price realization across our end markets.\nOur end market outlook remains largely consistent with the view we offered last quarter with a few notable changes. We continue to expect our utility business to grow low single digits. On the wastewater side, we expect low to mid-single-digit growth on resilient global demand. We anticipate wastewater demand in emerging markets to continue being driven by investment in public utilities, healthy OpEx activity as well as the benefit of our localization strategy. One note though is some shift to the second half due to the impacts from COVID closures in China.\nThe outlook for longer-term capital project spending and bid activity remains very solid globally. On the clean water side, we continue to expect demand to remain very robust as the AMI and the advantages of static meters continue to gain momentum with an increasingly broad spectrum of utilities.\nWith double-digit revenue growth in the second half on improving chip supply, we expect full year revenues to be flat. We expect continued momentum in our test and assessment services businesses due to increasing focus on infrastructure and climate challenges.\nPlease turn to Slide 11. Looking at the industrial end market, we continue to expect mid-single-digit growth on steady demand for our solutions globally. We foresee healthy growth in dewatering, especially in Emerging Markets from robust mining demand and our channel expansion strategy. In the U.S. and Western Europe, we expect solid order rates and backlog expansion as activity continues to ramp in light industrial applications with considerable traction from new product introductions and large account activity in Western Europe.\nThe commercial end market is now expected to deliver mid-single to high single-digit growth, up from mid-single-digit growth on solid replacement activity and new product introductions in the U.S. and Europe. In residential, our smallest end market, we now expect mid-single-digit growth up from low single-digit to mid-single-digit growth on healthy demand.\nAnd now let's turn to Slide 12, and I'll walk you through our updated guidance. As Patrick mentioned, our outperformance in the first quarter is giving us risk momentum, and we are increasing full year guidance for organic revenue growth and raising the low end of the adjusted EPS range. I want to take a moment to walk you through the puts and takes of how we now see the full year. We are lifting full year organic revenue growth to 4% to 6%, up from 3% to 5%. The 1% organic growth increase is driven primarily by stronger price realization. But from a reporting perspective, we anticipate it will be offset by a lower euro.\nWe are narrowing the EPS range to $2.40 to $2.70, which boosts the low end from $2.35. This reflects strong price realization, which will be partially offset by inflation and the euro FX headwinds. The emerging impact from a weakening euro is significant to us. Our initial full year guidance assumed a euro of 1.13. Our updated guidance now assumes a euro at 1.05, which is a $0.10 headwind to the full year EPS guide.\nFor your reference, we have included an FX sensitivity table in the appendix. We will closely monitor the global supply chain environment and continue to proactively manage impact from China's COVID lockdowns and the secondary effects of the war in Ukraine.\nOn Slide 13, we've shown how our guidance breaks down by segment. We continue to expect mid-single-digit growth in Water Infrastructure, high single-digit growth in Applied Water, up from mid-single-digit growth due to stronger price. We continue to expect Measurement & Control Solutions to be flattish. This assumes down roughly double digits in the first half of the year and up double digits in the second half. Although growth is still likely to be constrained by the gradual return of chip supply as the year progresses.\nFor 2022, we still expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of 16% to 17%. And this yields adjusted EPS range of $2.40 to $2.70 that I just mentioned. And we still expect free cash flow conversion to be 100% of net income. We have also provided you with a number of other full year assumptions on the slide to supplement your models.\nAnd now drilling down on the second quarter. We anticipate total company organic revenues will be flattish to up 1%. This includes low single-digit growth in Water Infrastructure and mid-single-digit growth in Applied Water, and M&CS is expected to decline low double digits. We expect second quarter adjusted EBITDA margin to be in the range of 14.5% to 15%, a sequential improvement over the prior quarter.\nAnd with that, please turn to Slide 14, and I'll turn the call back over to Patrick for closing comments.\n\nPatrick K. Decker\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Xylem Inc.\n\nThanks, Sandy. We came into 2022 in a strong and enviable position, even in the face of headwinds from chip supply and inflation. Our performance in the first quarter has shown the team's ability to capitalize on our market leadership and deliver with discipline despite the various challenges around the world.\nDemand has never been greater, we have strong commercial momentum, and we have a powerful balance sheet giving us strategic flexibility. And we have a great team showing resilience, agility and experience in managing the dynamics of a truly global business.\nWhile our customers are as local as water is, the biggest water challenges are global, and the water sector is increasingly well networked internationally. Still, Xylem is one of only a small handful of global water players. That puts us in a strong position to play a leadership role in support of both the sector and our mission to solve water. So as you likely saw in our March announcement, we made the decision to move Xylem's headquarters to Washington, D.C., which is one of the main crossroads of the global water sector. Washington is not just the seat of U.S. water policy. It's where water thought leaders from all over the world convene, including the private sector, governments from around the world, multilaterals, academia and civil society.\nWe've also taken the opportunity of the move to reimagine our footprint for more flexible ways of working and simplifying and leaning our headquarters. The new location is on Water Street. Yes, it's on Water Street, right on the Anacostia River. We'll be officially opening the space in mid-June, and I look forward to welcoming all of you when you visit D.C.\nBefore turning to your questions, I have one more special note of thanks. This is Matt Latino's last quarterly earnings call at the helm of Investor Relations. We previously announced that Matt is taking a new role in Xylem, and it's an exciting new chapter for him. I know from comments so many of you have made over the years that you deeply value Matt's energy, accessibility and professionalism, and I benefited from his insightful counsel and his persistent positive encouragement through every kind of circumstance. So thank you, Matt.\nSome of you have already met Andrea van der Berg, who's taking the reins as our Investor Relations leader. Andrea has had great impact as the Head of Financial Planning and Analysis for Xylem. So she brings distinctively deep knowledge of the business to her leadership of IR. I'm confident you'll really enjoy getting to know Andrea and will find great value in working with her and from her insights and perspectives.\nNow operator, I'll turn the call over to you for questions."

(Operator Instructions).\nI would now like to turn the call over to Andrea van der Berg, Vice President, Investor Relations.\n\nAndrea van der Berg\n\nGood morning, everyone, and welcome to Xylem's Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. With me today are Chief Executive Officer, Patrick Decker; and Chief Financial Officer, Sandy Rowland. They'll will provide their perspective on Xylem's second quarter 2022 results and discuss the third quarter and full year outlook. Following our prepared remarks, we will address questions related to the information covered on the call.

We've provided you with a summary of our key performance metrics, including both GAAP and non-GAAP metrics in the appendix.\nFor purposes of today's call, all references will be on an adjusted basis, unless otherwise indicated, and non-GAAP financials have been reconciled for you and are also included in the Appendix section of the presentation. Now please turn to Slide 3, and I'll turn the call over to our CEO, Patrick Decker.\n\nPatrick K. Decker\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Xylem Inc.\n\nThanks, Andrea, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased to report that the team delivered a very strong second quarter performance on all key metrics and well ahead of our guidance. But the result builds on the momentum and underlying demand we saw in the first quarter with disciplined operational execution on strong fundamentals and a moderate easing in chip supply constraints.\nRevenues grew 6% organically, surpassing our guide. The team's commercial performance was outstanding in all segments and supply improvements in M&CS and Water Infrastructure enabled increased conversion of orders into revenue. Geographically, the growth was broad-based, western Europe was up 9%, North America 6%; and emerging markets, excluding China, was up double digits. While China was down due to COVID lockdowns, backlogs continue to grow on underlying demand.\nIn addition to organic revenue growth, the team posted 6% orders growth. That orders momentum reflects strong performance across each segment. Water Infrastructure set the strongest pace, growing orders 21% in the quarter. Our backlogs were up shortly versus last year, with digital solutions comprising more than half the total backlog. EBITDA margin also came in well ahead of our guidance. We delivered strong quarter-on-quarter expansion driven by disciplined execution. All of that good work delivered earnings per share of $0.66, which soundly beat our expectations. As you can see, some incremental improvement in chip supply came earlier than anticipated, and it had a strong positive impact on the quarter. To be clear, we don't believe chip supply will improve much more quickly than previously expected.\nWhat we are seeing is a gradual improvement in supply, which provides further confidence in our second half outlook. The team also delivered pricing actions to mitigate inflation across all segments, and I want to give a big shout out to the entire team, including our distribution and channel partners for managing through a dynamic market environment. We combine those disciplined actions with productivity savings from simplifying the way we work and entirely offset inflation in the quarter.\nWe expect demand to remain resilient due to the essential nature of the services our customers need from us. So as you've seen in this morning's release, we are raising our organic revenue guidance to 8% to 10% growth for the full year, and we're raising the bottom end of our EPS range by $0.10. And -- we'll come back and discuss our overview of the macro environment in a few minutes, but let me hand it over now to Sandy for some additional color on the second quarter.\n\nSandra E. Rowland\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Xylem Inc.\n\nThanks, Patrick. Please turn to Slide 4. The team did a tremendous job, over-delivering on our commitments with disciplined execution on strong fundamentals and continuing demand. As a result, revenues grew globally, high single digit and mid-single digits in the U.S. In emerging markets, revenue grew low double digits, excluding China, which was slowed by ongoing COVID restrictions.\nIn a moment, I'll detail performance by segment. But in short, utilities was up 2%, led by strength in Western Europe and the U.S. Industrial grew 12% on increasing activity in all geographies, particularly the U.S., Western Europe and Latin America. Commercial was down 1%. Strength in Western Europe was offset by continued U.S. supply chain challenges.\nAnd residential was up 13%, led by commercial execution and backlog conversion in the U.S. Organic orders were up 6% in the quarter, with water infrastructure up 21% and AWS up 2%, partially offset by M&CS. Global demand continues to be strong, and our book-to-bill ratio was a healthy 1.2 in the quarter.\nEBITDA margin was 16.6%, well above our guided range, and that reflects a 240 basis point rise sequentially on strong commercial execution and discipline on discretionary costs. Price contributed 2 points of incremental revenue growth sequentially. As Patrick mentioned, pricing and productivity benefits combined more than offset inflation, and our EPS in the quarter was $0.66, coming in above expectations.\nPlease turn to Slide 5, and I'll review the quarter's segment performance in a bit more detail. Water Infrastructure revenue exceeded expectations, growing 9% organically in the quarter. Industrial remained strong, driven by continued backlog conversion, and our U.S. wastewater utility business grew double digits as supply chain constraints improved throughout the quarter.\nGeographically, the U.S. and Western Europe were also up double digits, driven by robust transport demand in the U.S. and treatment applications in Western Europe, alongside strong dewatering growth. Emerging markets, excluding China, was up high single digits, driven by strength across Latin America and Africa. These markets were down mid-single digits, including China, due to COVID site access restrictions there.\nOrders in the second quarter were up 21% organically versus last year, with growth underpinned by strong underlying demand supported by large infrastructure projects in the U.S. and Canada. We also saw sustained demand in our wastewater utility business in North America and Western Europe. EBITDA margin for the segment was up 240 basis points as strong price realization, volume and productivity benefits more than offset inflation and investments.\nPlease turn to Page 6. In the Applied Water segment, second quarter organic revenues grew 7%, modestly exceeding our expectations. Geographically, the U.S. was up high single digits with strength across industrial and residential, partially offset by supply chain constraints in the commercial business. Western Europe delivered low double-digit growth with healthy gains across all end markets, led by benefits from new energy-efficient product introductions.\nEmerging markets was up low single digits driven by strong industrial demand. Orders were up 2% organically and continued to outpace revenue with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.1 for the quarter. Segment's EBITDA margin declined 130 basis points compared to the prior year. And while price realization more than offset inflation, volume and mix for the quarter were negative. Despite lower volumes, demand remains robust as seen in our book-to-bill ratio. However, we expect to continue to deliver sequential EBITDA improvement as the benefit of pricing actions comes through our backlog.\nAnd now let's turn to Slide 7, and I'll cover our Measurement & Control Solutions business. M&TS exceeded expectations on strong demand and modestly better chip supply with revenue declining 2% organically. We also saw strong growth in our test and pipeline assessment services product lines. Geographically, the U.S. and Western Europe were down mid-single digits and emerging markets was up high single digits.\nM&CS orders declined 9% organically in the quarter, due to lapping some large deals in North America and the U.K. Underlying demand for our AMI offering remains strong and orders continue to outpace revenue. We recorded a book-to-bill ratio of 1.4 and have built a backlog of over $2 billion.\nSegment EBITDA margin in the quarter was ahead of expectations, expanding 120 basis points sequentially on improved volumes. As supply chain stability improves and we convert our backlog, we will see strong margin accretion on higher volumes as we have previously discussed.\nAnd now let's turn to Slide 8 for an overview of cash flows and our balance sheet. In the second quarter, we generated free cash flow of $67 million, driven by income conversion, partially offset by higher working capital. Our financial position remains strong with $1.1 billion in cash and $1.9 billion of available liquidity. Net debt-to-EBITDA leverage is 1.5x.\nI'm going to turn to Slide 9, and I'll hand the call back to Patrick to look forward at the rest of the year.\n\nPatrick K. Decker\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Xylem Inc.\n\nThanks, Sandy. As you've seen, the team is delivering strong results in a very dynamic environment. Given the prominence of discussions about macro uncertainty in the economy, it's worth spending a few minutes talking about our confidence and the resilience of underlying demand for Xylem's offerings. The aspect of our sector and our business model that gets most discussed in this context and for good reason, is that our offering is at the core of essential services through the ups and downs of economic cycles.\nCities and towns must provide essential water and wastewater services. So the demand associated with water management tends to be quite resilient. It's also important to understand the dynamics between OpEx versus CapEx across economic cycles, particularly for water utilities. OpEx spending is very stable, given the basic need for day-to-day water services. CapEx, which represents roughly 1/3 of spending on Xylem's offerings is focused on infrastructure expansion or refurbishment and it comes with longer regulatory and funding approvals.\nSo spending against these projects once approved historically has not wavered to a material extent. And this is not just a U.S. dynamic, but it applies globally. You see it in Europe, both at the regional level. For example, with the EU's recovery and resilience funding and at the country level as seen in the U.K.'s AMP process. Similarly, infrastructure funding is embedded in China's 5-year planning cycle.\nAnd of course, you're all familiar with the recent U.S. federal infrastructure funding and the time lines on which the state-revolving funds at work. Those structural advantages of the sector, however, are only a benefit if our portfolio delivers distinctive value to our customers through the cycle.\nFor many of our customers, value is defined in terms of becoming more efficient, and that means modernizing their infrastructure with digital technologies to make their networks more affordable. Our AMI metrology backlogs offer a proof point about the resilience of that demand.\nDespite the ongoing chip supply challenges that have dogged the tech sector for the last year, our backlogs have continued to grow. Our distinctive data and communications driven AMI solutions deliver a step change in both efficiency and resilience for utilities. AMI represents now roughly 1/3 of all water meters in the U.S., which shows the progress of adoption, but also the potential for future growth. Given the budgetary pressures the utilities face, both to generate revenue and reduce water loss, smart meters will remain a top imperative.\nOne other demand trend that will persist in the cycle and, in fact, is set to increase is the growing response to climate change. Cities around the world are committing to net 0 emissions. At the same time, they are investing in mitigating the impacts of climate change that are already here, like those we've seen this summer in the form of historic and tragic flooding in the U.S. and Asia. These are generational challenges.\nInnovation and new approaches are absolutely essential to solving them because water management is a significant carbon contributor, accounting for up to 10% of greenhouse gas emissions globally. In commercial and residential markets, cities have begun introducing building regulations to reduce emissions, including efficient water management standards for both regional construction and retrofits and the utility market, which produces greenhouse gas emissions equal to the entire global shipping industry. It's going to be required to reduce its carbon intensity in line with the commitments of their cities, municipalities and countries.\nAnd we at Xylem are an outright leader in this space and are in a unique position to support our customers and their sustainability commitments. You may have seen that we released our annual sustainability report in May. Among all the progress made against our 2025 goals, I'd highlight that we enabled our customers to reduce their carbon footprint by 730,000 metric tons in 2021 alone using our technology. That is the equivalent of taking 160,000 cars off the road. And we're on track to help them reduce their emissions by 2.8 million metric tons by 2025.\nSo stepping back, we're very confident that the macro forces driving our underlying demand will continue. We're also confident that Xylem is better positioned than ever to create value by helping our customers respond to them.\nSo now I'll turn it back over to Sandy for more detail and color on our outlook and guide.\n\nSandra E. Rowland\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Xylem Inc.\n\nThanks, Patrick. Consistent with our previous presentations, we've provided key facts for each end market in the appendix. The outlook across our end markets has broadly improved. We expect healthy underlying demand will continue through the remainder of the year with improved price cost mix and modest improvements in supply chain. We now expect our utility business to grow mid-single digits, up from low single digits.\nOn the wastewater side, we now expect mid-single-digit growth, up from low to mid-single-digit growth on improved backlog conversion and resilient global demand. the outlook for longer-term capital project spending and bid activity remains solid globally. For clean water utilities, we now expect mid-single-digit growth, up from flat. The main driver is earlier than expected easing of chip supply constraints.\nAlthough supply has improved, lead times continue to remain elevated and our volumes continue to be constrained. We also expect momentum in our test and pipeline assessment services business to continue due to increasing focus in our end markets on infrastructure and climate challenges as evidenced by our strong backlog.\nPlease turn to Slide 11. Looking at the industrial end market, we now expect high single-digit to low double-digit growth, up from mid-single-digit growth, our increased activity in the U.S. and Europe and strong global demand for our solutions. We continue to expect the commercial end market to deliver mid-single to high single-digit growth on solid replacement activity and new introductions in the U.S. and Europe.\nIn residential, our smallest end market, we now expect healthy demand to drive double-digit growth, up from mid-single digits. As a reminder, the majority of our commercial and residential end market exposure is replacement driven versus new construction.\nNow let's turn to Slide 12, and I'll walk you through our updated guidance. Our out-performance in the second quarter gives us confidence to increase our full year guidance for organic revenue growth and to raise the low end of the adjusted EPS range. We now expect full year organic revenue growth of 8% to 10%, up from 4% to 6%, and we have raised the bottom end of our EPS range by $0.10. The increase in the reported revenue guidance is more modest as the strength of the dollar offsets roughly half of our operational improvements.\nWe have modified our assumptions on our basket of currency exposure, which is included in the appendix. These changes result in an incremental $0.05 headwind to the full year EPS guide. And this is on top of a $0.10 EPS FX headwind that we discussed last quarter.\nOn Slide 13, we've shown how our guidance breaks down by segment. We now expect high single-digit growth in Water Infrastructure, up from mid-single digits and low double-digit growth in Applied Water, up from high single digits, driven by disciplined commercial execution and backlog conversion on continuing strong demand in both segments.\nWe now expect Measurement & Control Solutions to be up mid-single digits, up from flat. This reflects the out-performance in the first half from chip supply improving sooner than expected. For 2022, we are raising the bottom end of our adjusted EBITDA margin range, which is now 16.5% to 17%. And [this year you'll see] adjusted EPS range of $2.50 to $2.70 that I just mentioned.\nWe now expect free cash flow conversion to be approximately 90% of net income. We're carrying about a month of extra inventory to mitigate the risk of supply chain disruptions and provide continuity of service to our customers. We expect to bring conversion back to historical levels as supply chain stabilize, enabling us to return to free cash flow conversion of at least 100%. We have provided you with a number of other full year assumptions on this slide to supplement your models.\nAnd now drilling down on the third quarter, we anticipate total company organic revenues will be up 10% to 12%. This includes mid-single-digit growth in water infrastructure and mid-double-digit growth in Applied Water and M&CS. We expect third quarter adjusted EBITDA margin to be in the range of 16.5% to 17%, a sequential improvement over the prior quarter.\nAnd with that, please turn to Slide 14, and I'll turn the call back over to Patrick for closing comments.\n\nPatrick K. Decker\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Xylem Inc.\n\nThanks, Sandy. We saw the power of some short-term swings this past quarter. A small improvement in chip supply had a big impact. Currency movements have been offering what you could call a challenging forecasting environment and the unexpected duration of COVID shutdowns held China back. Just a quick note on China. Our team and our customers there have been continuing to serve their communities under very tough conditions, given the extensive restrictions in place to manage COVID. I'm incredibly proud of the team.\nWe expect to see progressive improvements in the market for the second half and have full confidence China will continue to be a source of innovation and growth for the long run. In the context of short-term uncertainty, [our job is] -- demands through the unexpected, meeting those challenges is what being a good operator is all about. And the team has certainly been doing that. The team's strong operational execution is built on the same foundation as our 2025 growth and strategic milestones, a consistent story at the heart of our investment thesis.\nWe are building on our leadership position as a technology company with a durable business model. We're benefiting from long-term secular trends of rising demand, driven by water and climate-related challenges. We're driving above-market growth and margin expansion as we digitize our portfolio to serve our customers' imperative to be more efficient.\nWe're successfully putting sustainability at the center of everything we do across our company, our customers and our communities. And we'll create additional stakeholder value with disciplined capital allocation as opportunities warrant. Strong continued demand and the kind of performance we're seeing from the Xylem team show our ability to deliver on that thesis.\nAnd with that, operator, let's open it up for Q&A."

Brands, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jody, and good morning, everyone. As we reflect on 2021, I couldn't be prouder of the collective accomplishments of our world-class franchise partners and collaboration of our global teams, guided by our recipe for growth and good. While the last 2 years have been the most challenging operating environment we've ever navigated, we exit 2021 stronger than ever with over 53,000 global restaurants.\nCompared to 2019, we've nearly doubled our digital business. System sales have grown over $5.5 billion, and operating profit has grown over $200 million. Additionally, since 2019, we've added another iconic brand and closed on 3 technology acquisitions. All while launching our global unlocking opportunity initiative with a $100 million commitment over 5 years investing in equity and inclusion, education and entrepreneurial, the cornerstones of our Recipe for Good.\nIn 2021, we opened 3,057 net new units, driven by 4,180 gross unit openings with meaningful contributions from each of our brands, marking the strongest growth year in our history and setting an industry record for unit development. To put that into context, as the world's largest restaurant company, we opened a new restaurant on average every 2 hours. This speaks to the health of our business, iconic brand, capable, committed and well-capitalized franchise partners and strong unit economics. This is yet another significant development milestone on our ongoing growth journey, providing customers with access to our brands through a variety of restaurant formats and on- and off-premise ordering channels.\nNow more than ever, we've leaned into the structural advantages of our diversified global portfolio by leveraging our unmatched global scale, sophisticated supply chains marketing and consumer insights expertise and our growing digital and technology capabilities to fuel growth and deliver strong results.\nEven as dining room sales recovered throughout the year, we continued to grow our digital sales that reached a record $22 billion in fiscal 2021, an increase of approximately 25% over 2020, suggesting a more permanent shift to digital channels. We ended the year with over 45,000 restaurants offering delivery, representing more than a 25% increase year-over-year. We galvanized our digital and technology strategy and accelerated the development of our ecosystem with both internal investments and the closing of the Quantum TikTok and Dragontail acquisition.\nOur teams remain focused on elevating the customer experience, expanding our off-premise capabilities and empowering our team members with tools to make it easier to run our restaurants, all ultimately fueling improved unit economics. Expectations of our customers, team members and franchisees have forever changed due to the experiences over the past 2 years, and we continue to challenge ourselves to exceed their rising bar.\nI'm confident we're poised to lead the industry as we embark on the next chapter of our growth journey. Today, I'll discuss our 2021 results showcasing a few examples across our brands for 2 of the 4 pillars in our Recipe for Growth: our relevant, easy and distinctive brands, or R.E.D. for short; and our unrivaled culture and talent. Then I'll share progress on our recipe for good. Chris will share our fourth quarter results and provide an update on the other 2 pillars of our Recipe for Growth: bold restaurant development and unmatched operating capability, as well as an update on our strong balance sheet position and capital allocation strategy.\nTo begin, Full year 2021 system sales grew 13%, with same-store sales growth of 10% or 3% on a 2-year basis and 6% unit growth. Each of our brands recorded positive same-store sales growth for the year and contributed to broad-based development strength. Full year core operating profit increased 18%, driven by same-store sales growth and the impact of unit development throughout the year.\nAs we ended the year, COVID outbreaks and resulting government restrictions, limiting mobility continued to impact sales in a few key markets, primarily in Asia, presenting a headwind to fourth quarter results. However, our sales momentum remained strong with continued global recovery as evidenced by our 2-year global same-store sales, excluding Asia, up 10% on a 2-year basis, accelerating sequentially from last quarter.\nNext, I'll talk about our 4 R.E.D. brands. I'll begin with KFC, which accounts for 52% of our divisional operating profit. KFC full year 2021 system sales grew 16%, driven by 11% same-store sales growth and 8% unit growth. Q4 system sales increased 10% with 5% same-store sales growth or 3% on a 2-year basis. We continue to see ongoing recovery in emerging markets as evidenced by the fact that more than half of our 13 global KFC regions delivered system sales growth in excess of 25% for the full year.\nKFC International Q4 same-store sales grew 6% or 2% on a 2-year basis. Sales remained strong throughout the quarter despite regional impacts from COVID variants with momentum holding in many recovered markets more than offsetting heavily impacted markets, including parts of Asia and Western Europe. Common themes fueling top line growth in the quarter include off-premise and digital capabilities, newsworthy products and a strong value offering.\nKFC U.S. Q4 same-store sales grew 4% or 12% on a 2-year basis. Strong top line momentum was fueled by strength in group occasions growth in the digital channel and the success of our chicken sandwich. The chicken sandwich continues to perform well for the business and now makes up roughly 9% of our sales mix as of Q4, and a strong improvement from a 1% mix last year. Our sandwiches are served straight from the fryer and hot to our guests. We expect the chicken sandwich platform to continue to be a significant driver of our positive sales momentum for the business going forward.\nNext, Taco Bell, which accounts for 32% of our divisional operating profit. Before delving into results, I'd like to congratulate the entire Taco Bell system for ranking #1 in the Franchise 500 for the second year in a row, beating our peers as well as impressive concepts in other industries. Entrepreneur magazine, which produces this list recognized Taco Bell for its franchisee collaboration and innovation. This recognition is further evidence of our intentionality to be the world's franchisor of choice.\nNow I'll discuss our results for the year. Taco Bell full year 2021 system sales grew 13%, driven by 11% same-store sales growth and 5% unit growth. Fourth quarter system sales grew 11%, with same-store sales growth of 8% or 9% on a 2-year basis, reflecting an acceleration from Q3. Taco Bell kicked off the quarter by introducing the new Cantina Crispy Melt Taco and later in the quarter brought back the Grill Cheese Burrito, featuring a grilled and bubbly blend of real cheddar, mozzarella and pepper jack cheeses. Additionally, the team kept value front and center with the launch of a new crave more value menu featuring the $2 burritos. In addition, we launched a new lineup of coasted breakfast burritos as a way to welcome customers back to our breakfast daypart.\nTaco Bell fans continue to adopt digital ordering channels as we set digital sales records in both the U.S. and international this year. We will continue to bring distinctive products to life through our digital channels with early access to new products, digital-only campaigns and loyalty rewards.\nMoving on to Pizza Hut, which accounts for 16% of our divisional operating profit. Full year 2021 system sales grew 6%, driven by 7% same-store sales growth and 4% unit growth. Q4 system sales grew 4% with same-store sales growth of 3% or 2% on a 2-year basis. Overall, we saw an inflection in the growth trajectory of the Pizza Hut brand this year, a testament to the hard work of our team members and franchise operators and a reflection of the overall health of the system.\nPizza Hut International Q4 same-store sales grew 4%, while same-store sales declined 3% on a 2-year basis. Key markets that contributed strong performance in the quarter included Africa, Canada, India and the U.K. The brand remains focused on emphasizing easy through rate and continued growth in off-premise channels through utilization of both first- and third-party delivery networks.\nPizza U.S. Q4 same-store sales grew 1% or 10% on a 2-year basis. The team continues to bring iconic pizza that customers love to market in relevant and distinctive ways. In the fourth quarter, Pizza Hut received strong recognition for an influencer-based marketing campaign that resulted in Pizza Hut being named a 2021 culture driver by TikTok. Additionally, we brought back a fan favorite, the Triple Treat Box, offering customers a convenient and value-oriented family meal option which drove sales in the quarter.\nLastly, the Habit Burger Grill achieved full year 2021 system sales growth of 24%, driven by a 16% same-store sales growth and 11% unit growth. Q4 system sales increased 20% with 11% same-store sales growth or 5% on a 2-year basis. To showcase their chef-inspired innovations, the Habit Burger Grill reintroduced the Chicken Caprese Sandwich on garlic chabada bread with garlic Ole during the quarter. As dining rooms have reopened over the course of the year, have team members welcome customers back into the restaurants while continuing to serve customers through their digital and off-premise channels.\nNow I'll discuss our unrivaled culture and talent growth driver. The hallmark of Yum! is our people-first culture, which drives retention and recruitment of amazing talent. We remain committed to growing our talent from within and recruiting top external talent, as you've seen from some of our recent internal promotions and leadership transitions. This past quarter, we were excited to welcome former NIKE Executive, Sean Tresbon, to serve as Taco Bell Chief Brand Officer; while former Nintendo Executive, Nick Chavez, joined KFC U.S. as Chief Marketing Officer.\nPast 2 years have allowed us to build a strong foundation centered on our culture, talent and unwavering relationships with our franchisees. The collaboration with our franchisees has never been more powerful as we're aligned more than ever on the future growth trajectory of the business. Finally, I want to give an update on our Recipe for Good and the work we're doing around our 3 priority pillars: planet, food and people.\nWhen it comes to our planet pillar, 2021 was a milestone year. We announced science-based targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions nearly 50% by 2030 and and pledged to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. We are expanding our foundational requirements for green building standards for new unit builds and advancing our corporate office and company-owned restaurant footprint to renewable energy.\nIn terms of our food, we remain focused on food safety and listening and responding to customers' evolving preferences and improving the nutritional value of our menu items. We continue to introduce relevant and distinctive plant-based offerings from KFC's national launch of Beyond Fried Chicken in the U.S., the Pizza Hut offering beyond Italian Sausage Crumble in Canada.\nFinally, on the people front, we're committed to investing in Yum!'s social purpose focused on unlocking opportunities for our people and communities while championing equity, inclusion and belonging across all aspects of our business. Just last week, we announced the Yum! Franchise Accelerator, a groundbreaking partnership with the University of Louisville and Howard University to train and advance underrepresented minorities and women interested in building a career in the restaurant industry. Not only is this a priority for Yum!, but unlocking opportunity remains a focus for our brands as well with the recent launch of the Taco Bell business school.\nAs a result of our elevated commitments and transparent disclosures, we've received notable recognition this quarter, including being named the Dow Jones Sustainability Index North America for the fifth consecutive year and being named on Newsweek's ranking of America's most responsible companies. I'm incredibly proud of our Recipe for Good and know that this work is more important than ever when it comes to building resilient and relevant brands for the future.\nAs I take a moment to reflect on the past 2 years, I'm extremely proud and grateful for the significant accomplishments and collaboration across our teams to both serve our customers and community while fueling growth for our franchisees and shareholders. We're entering 2022, which marks Yum! 25th anniversary with confidence in our recipe for growth and good strategies, and I'm energized for what lies ahead.\nI'm certain we'll continue to build the world's most loved, trusted and fastest-growing restaurant brands while delivering lasting value for our stakeholders. With that, Chris, over to you.\n\nChristopher Lee Turner\n\nCFO, Yum! Brands, Inc.\n\nThank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our fourth quarter financial results, bold restaurant development and unmatched operating capability as well as our strong balance sheet position and capital allocation strategy. I'll begin by discussing our financial results.\nWe finished the year strong opening a record-breaking 4,180 gross units or 3,057 net new units, resulting in 6% unit growth for full year 2021, a robust 10% same-store sales growth helped us achieve 13% system sales growth, driving full year core operating profit growth of 18%. That is a tremendous outcome given the inflation, labor, supply chain and consumer mobility challenges our brands faced in the back half of the year, particularly in Q4.\nQ4 results also reflects impressive performance. System sales grew 9%, led by same-store sales growth of 5% or 4% on a 2-year basis, accelerating from Q3. Strong underlying profit growth was masked by elevated G&A levels owing to higher incentive compensation as a result of our strong full year results, and the normalization of Taco Bell company-owned restaurant margins in the quarter as previously signaled. We anticipate quarterly variability in our company-owned restaurant margins as we remain focused on balancing relative value for our customers while protecting margins in the long run.\nTo that end, full year 2021 Taco Bell company-owned restaurant margins were in line with our historical range of 23% to 24%, virtually unchanged relative to 2019 levels. This demonstrates our ability to drive strong top line results while managing profitability in an inflationary environment. Our Q4 ex special EPS was impacted by 2 items: First, we recorded a $35 million pretax gain on our investment in Debyani International Limited; second, we had a higher-than-normal tax rate for the quarter due to a tax reserve related to a prior year filing position that was changed. And so our Q4 results were in line with our internal expectations and culminated in full year results that exceeded all elements of our long-term growth algorithm.\nMoving on to our bold restaurant development growth driver. We opened 1,678 gross units in the quarter or 1,259 on a net new unit basis, resulting in nearly 4,200 gross units opened for the full year, which is a record for Yum! and the restaurant industry. That equates to over 100,000 jobs created worldwide last year alone. We're able to achieve these record-breaking openings thanks to contributions from each of our 4 brands and incredible franchisees around the globe.\nChina continues to be the biggest developer However, we continue to see broad-based strength across our portfolio, evidenced by over 2,500 restaurants opened outside of China this year. In fact, we saw new restaurants built in over 110 countries this year a step-up from prior years, signaling our development engine is diversified and stronger than ever.\nAt KFC, the brand delivered a record development year led by significant contributions from China, India and Russia. Overall, KFC International opened over 2,400 gross units and nearly 2,000 net new units during 2021. At KFC U.S., after several years of same-store sales growth and strengthening unit economics, we have a much stronger foundation now on which to grow in the future as evidenced by the inflection point in development with the system moving to positive unit growth in 2021.\nTaco Bell reported a strong development year in both the U.S. and international. In the U.S., Taco Bell reached an impressive milestone, ending the year with over 7,000 restaurants and ample white space for future development.\nDuring the fourth quarter, Taco Bell celebrated MOS international expansion as Spain was the first market to surpass 100 units. We believe this development threshold unlocks accelerated growth, fueled by the benefits of scale, including supply chain advantages as well as marketing and brand awareness. We're confident in what the future holds for Taco Bell International, particularly as scale ties directly to profitability.\nPizza Hut International delivered a record year in development with all international business units reporting net positive growth led by China and India. Continued improvement in unit economics and a more HMR-focused footprint are drivers of the broad-based unit growth. Pizza Hut U.S. continues to make progress on its development journey and is poised for future growth, thanks to improved unit economics at a healthy franchise base.\nFinally, the Habit Burger Grill restarted their development engine this year with 23 net new units. Our brands are entering 2022 from a position of strength with plans to continue exceptional growth owing to our world-class operators and franchise partners. We're confident in our future growth engine given our broad-based strength, improved unit economics and the visibility we have into our development pipeline.\nI want to say a huge thank you to our development teams and franchise partners for all the hard work it takes to open nearly 4,200 restaurants in a single year, let alone a year with ongoing COVID and supply chain-related challenges.\nNext, I'll talk about our unmatched operating capability growth driver. We remain focused on leveraging our digital and technology strategy to elevate both customer and team member experiences by leaning in on 3 key elements: easy experiences, easy operations and easy insights.\nStarting with easy experiences, we expanded our digital ordering channels, including chat ordering via TikTok to nearly 2,000 stores at year-end, an increase of roughly 60% since our acquisition in the first quarter. We also saw digital sales at KFC U.S. grew approximately 70% year-over-year, fueled by our delivery service channel and e-commerce platform that launched nationwide in early 2021.\nWe continue to invest in technology platforms focused on delivering a frictionless experience for our guests, including the launch of quick pickup at KFC U.S. in the fourth quarter that allows guests to bypass the drive-thru and grab their digital orders from (inaudible) inside the restaurant. The outstanding sales growth across our digital channels is evidence that our customers continue to expect and opt for easy access to our brands.\nNow moving on to easy operations, which are focused on making it easier for our team members to run the business and ensure a superior customer experience. I want to highlight the exceptional operating performance of our brands, starting with Taco Bell, whose team members were unwavering in their commitment to deliver a superior customer experience. In 2021, Taco Bell's drive-thru times were 2 seconds faster year-over-year, and the fourth quarter marked the eighth consecutive quarter of an average drive-thru time under 4 minutes. This truly is an impressive performance considering labor availability challenges.\nAdditionally, the Dragontail order and delivery platform is now live in 2,800 stores in 21 markets across KFC and Pizza Hut, up from 13 markets last quarter and 9 markets from the end of 2020. Dragontail allows us to tap into the power of artificial intelligence to streamline the end-to-end food preparation process and optimize delivery routes for drivers.\nAt Pizza Hut International, we continued deploying HutBot, our intelligent cooking app, designed to enhance both the team member and customer experience by digitizing routines and insights into operational efficiencies. When HutBot is deployed and used effectively, it's proven to increase customer satisfaction scores. We ended the year with HutBot live in over 6,000 Pizza Hut locations in 70 markets.\nTo round out our technology strategy, our easy insights platform provides us with invaluable knowledge about our consumers, enabling us to enhance the customer relationship. When we acquired Quantum, a leading AI-based consumer insights and marketing performance analytics business, in the first quarter, it was operating in 13 markets. We have since tripled Quantum's footprint to over 45 markets.\nWe will continue to prioritize initiatives that lead to incremental sales growth and improved unit economics for our franchisees. The impressive adoption rates of these technology platforms are evidence of our franchisees' confidence in the investments we made to advance our digital and technology ecosystem this year. We're confident these investments have created a meaningful competitive advantage and will be a point of differentiation for Yum! as we serve the elevated expectations of customers.\nNow for an update on our strong balance sheet position and our capital allocation strategy. We ended the year with cash and cash equivalents of $486 million, excluding restricted cash. We closed the year temporarily below our net leverage target of 5x as a result of our strong earnings growth. Capital expenditures, net of refranchising proceeds, were $55 million during the quarter and $145 million for the full year.\nThe full year consisted of $230 million in gross CapEx and $85 million in refranchising proceeds. We paid a healthy quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share or approximately $600 million for the full year. With respect to our share buyback program, during the quarter, we repurchased 5.6 million shares at an average share price of $128 totaling $720 million. For the full year, we have repurchased 13 million shares at an average price of $122 totaling $1.6 billion.\nAs we look to 2022, our capital priorities remain unchanged: invest in the business, maintain a healthy balance sheet, pay a competitive dividend and return excess cash to shareholders via share repurchases. We remain committed to maintaining our asset-light business model of at least a 98% franchise mix. Going forward, we expect strong returns from our equity store investments to continue. And like our franchisees, see attractive opportunities to invest in unit development.\nCapitalizing on these opportunities we expect net capital expenditures for full year 2022 to be approximately $250 million, reflecting up to $350 million of gross CapEx and $100 million of refranchising proceeds. In the long run, we expect our refranchising proceeds to offset our new store investments as they have in the past. But in the near term, new store investments may exceed refranchising by $50 million to $100 million annually, primarily driven by our strategy to accelerate growth of the habit equity estate. We were pleased to announce earlier this week an increase in our quarterly cash dividend of 14% to $0.57 per share in 2022. The recovery of our business in 2021 and proven resilience of our free cash flow supported this increase, reflecting a 2-year double-digit CAGR, in line with our historical earnings growth and dividend increases.\nI'd like to wrap up by providing color on the shape of 2022. I'm pleased to share that we expect to deliver full year growth in line with our long-term growth algorithm, which includes 2% to 3% same-store sales growth and 4% to 5% unit growth, culminating in mid- to high single-digit system sales growth leading to high single-digit core operating profit growth, which excludes FX. Reflecting on 2021 results, we had several quarterly drivers that created lumpiness in the shape of the year creating noise in our year-over-year lapse in 2022.\nWe expect our full year G&A to be approximately $1.1 billion but our G&A spend will return to a more balanced quarterly cadence relative to 2021. Given the shape of our anticipated G&A spend throughout 2022 in comparison to 2021, we expect G&A to be a headwind to operating profit growth in the first half and a tailwind to growth in the second half of 2022. Due primarily to these timing factors related to G&A, we are expecting roughly flat core operating profit growth in the first half and high teens core operating growth in the second half, culminating in full year high single-digit core operating profit growth in line with our long-term road map growth.\nFinally, on our 2022 effective tax rate, although it's difficult to forecast with precision at this time, we continue to believe 21% to 23% is the appropriate range. But there are factors that could move us toward the high end of the range. We'll continue to provide updates as appropriate. Overall, I couldn't be prouder of the results for the year.\nLooking forward to 2022, I'm confident we're poised to take share and deliver on our long-term growth algorithm driven by our expanding competitive advantages tied to our unmatched global scale, investments in our digital ecosystem and world-class franchise partners. I'm looking forward to the year ahead and the continued success of our iconic global brands while delivering consistent earnings growth for shareholders. With that, operator, we're ready to take any questions."

Brands, Inc. 2022 Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. My name is Charlie and I'll be coordinating the call today. (Operator Instructions)\nI will now hand over to your host, Gavin Felder, Chief Strategy Officer and Interim Head of Investor Relations, to begin. Gavin, please go ahead.\n\nGavin Felder\n\nChief Strategy Officer, Yum! Brands, Inc.\n\nThanks, operator. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. As a reminder, I will be covering for Jodi Dyer while she is on maternity leave. On our call today are David Gibbs, our CEO; Chris Turner, our CFO; and Dave Russell, our Senior Vice President and Corporate Controller. Following remarks from David and Chris, we'll open the call to questions.\nBefore we get started, please note that this call includes forward-looking statements that are subject to future events and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. All forward-looking statements are made only as of the date of this call and should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statements in our earnings release and the risk factors included in our filings with the SEC. In addition, please refer to our earnings release and relevant sections of our filings with the SEC to find disclosures, definitions and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures and other metrics used on today's call.\nPlease note that during today's call, all system sales growth and operating profit growth results exclude the impact of foreign currency. Please also note the following financial reporting treatment related to our exit from Russia. As a reminder, as of the beginning of the second quarter, we elected to remove the Russia business from key performance metrics.\nFor the purposes of this call, all references to system sales growth and unit growth results for the quarter are adjusted to remove our Russia business from the prior year base. This negatively impacted our worldwide unit growth by 2 percentage points and our worldwide system sales growth for both the fourth quarter and the full year by 2 percentage points. These units were removed from our same-store sales calculations and thus did not impact same-store sales results for the fourth quarter or full year.\nAll GAAP figures reported continue to include the impact of Russia operations for KFC for the full quarter and year, and for Pizza Hut prior to our transfer of that business to a local operator in the second quarter. These GAAP figures primarily include royalty revenues from continued franchise operations and G&A to support our Russia business. Additionally, our GAAP G&A includes expenses incurred relating to the transfer of ownership of the business.\nAs a result of our decision to exit our Russia business, we have reclassed net operating profits from the operating segments in which they are earned subsequent to the start of the conflict to corporate and unallocated and reflected those net operating profits as a special item within the other income and expense line.\nFor more information on our reporting calendar for each market, please visit the Financial Reports section of our website. We are broadcasting this conference call via our website. This call is also being recorded and will be available for playback. Looking ahead, our first quarter earnings will be released on May 3, 2023, with the conference call on the same day.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to David Gibbs.\n\nDavid W. Gibbs\n\nCEO & Director, Yum! Brands, Inc.\n\nThank you, Gavin, and good morning, everyone. 2022 truly was a landmark year for Yum!. In spite of the challenges from significant spikes in commodity inflation and pockets of labor shortages, our world-class teams and franchisees partnered together to deliver another year of amazing growth.\nWe achieved record-breaking industry development, opening 4,560 gross units that translated to nearly 3,100 net new units, beating our prior record set just last year and ending the year with over 55,000 restaurants globally. For the full year, system sales were up 8% and core operating profit was up 6%, which includes a 2-point headwind from the removal of Russia profits this year.\nPerhaps the most impressive performance came from Taco Bell, finishing 2022 with same-store sales growth of 8%. Taco Bell also bucked the industry trend on margins, holding company operated margins flat from last year despite elevated industry-wide cost pressure. KFC International delivered a record year, opening approximately 2,400 gross units and nearly 2,000 net new units, translating to 9% unit growth. Combined, these 2 parts of the business account for approximately 80% of our divisional operating profit.\nWe finished the year on a high note with system sales growth of 10% in Q4, driven by 6% same-store sales growth and 6% unit growth, contributing to 22% core operating profit growth, which includes a 2-point headwind from the removal of Russia profits this year.\nSuch incredible performance under highly challenging conditions underscores the tremendous confidence I have that even after a remarkable 25 years of growth as a public company, our best days are clearly ahead of us.\nBefore I discuss our 2022 results in detail, I wanted to give a brief update on our planned exit from Russia. As mentioned during our Q3 call, we have a signed purchase agreement to transfer ownership of our Russian KFC restaurants, operating system and master franchise rights to an existing KFC Russia franchisee. We expect the transaction to close following satisfaction of all closing conditions. Following the closing, we will have ceased our corporate presence in Russia.\nI also want to acknowledge the devastating impact of the earthquake that happened earlier this week, affecting our teams in Turkey. Our people remain our #1 priority, and I want to recognize the effort from our franchisee, Ilkem Sahin, as he and his team worked to prioritize people's safety as they navigate through this tragedy.\nAs we shared at our recent Investor Day, our strategy is guided by our Recipe for Good Growth. And today, we will discuss our 2022 results through the lens of that framework. I will talk about 2 of our growth drivers: namely our Relevant, Easy and Distinctive Brands, or R.E.D. for short; and our Unrivaled Culture and Talent. Then I'll provide an update on our efforts to drive the good agenda across our brands and our business. Chris will then share the details of our fourth quarter financial results before discussing our Bold Restaurant Development and Unmatched Operating Capabilities growth drivers.\nI'll start by discussing our iconic R.E.D. brands. Beginning with the KFC division, which accounts for 49% of our divisional operating profit. KFC full year 2022 system sales grew 9%, driven by 7% unit growth and 4% same-store sales growth. Q4 system sales for KFC increased 10%, thanks to 7% unit growth and 5% same-store sales growth. Results were unfavorably impacted by COVID-related challenges in China. Excluding China, our KFC business continues to grow at an unbelievable pace with same-store sales growing 9% in the quarter, driven in part by our world-class franchisees and continued impressive momentum in our emerging markets.\nAt KFC's International business, which represents 44% of our divisional operating profit, Q4 system sales grew 11%. Several markets showed stellar results. In Japan, for example, KFC is synonymous with the Christmas holiday family meal. And this year, Japan system sales over the Christmas period grew 16% year-over-year. Africa drove double-digit same-store sales growth in the quarter and continues to benefit from several customer-facing digital initiatives. To build on that success, our South Africa team will continue to roll out kiosks with a goal of installing them in 95% of our stores by 2023.\nMoving on to our Taco Bell division, which represents 35% of our divisional operating profit. On a global basis, full year system sales grew 11%, driven by 8% same-store sales growth and 5% unit growth. This team continues to deliver industry-leading results, and coupled with the incredible array of talent in place and our strong franchisee partnerships, it should be no surprise that Taco Bell earned the top spot on Entrepreneur magazine's Franchise 500 Ranking for the third year running.\nMoving on to our fourth quarter results. Taco Bell U.S. grew system sales 14%, underpinned by an exceptional 11% same-store sales growth. The powerful momentum from previous quarters continued with the relaunch of the cult classic Mexican Pizza for which we provided early access to our loyalty members. We ended the year with around 45 million Mexican Pizzas sold, an impressive number considering they were only available for 4 months of the year.\nWe also made encouraging progress in our breakfast layer, building on high-profile branding partnerships such as Doja Cat in Q1 and Davante Adams in Q3. Taco Bell brought in Pete Davidson to help drive consumer buzz for breakfast. This led to 9% transaction growth for the daypart. Overall, Taco Bell did a terrific job this quarter at balancing both ends of the consumer spectrum by featuring premium products that our consumers crave, such as the Grilled Cheese Burrito with sharply priced items like Nacho Fries.\nAt Taco Bell International, Q4 system sales grew 23%, driven by 29% unit growth and 4% same-store sales growth. Q4 closed a truly breakthrough year for our international business, which has now crossed the 1,000-unit mark. To put this speed into some historical context, Taco Bell International has built 40% of its current estate within the last 2 years. It wasn't just our development engine on fire this year, many of our markets reached double-digit same-store sales growth in 2022, including some of our largest markets with India, up 33%; Thailand, up 36%; and Spain, up 20%.\nNext, at the Pizza Hut division, which accounts for 16% of our divisional operating profit, our full year system sales grew 3%, led by 4% unit growth and flat same-store sales growth. Pizza Hut International, which accounts for 9% of our divisional operating profit, achieved system sales growth of 4%, driven by 6% unit growth and a 1% decline in same-store sales in the fourth quarter. Results were heavily impacted by the ongoing COVID-related challenges in China. Ex-China, our same-store sales remained healthy, growing 4%.\nSeveral markets showed noticeable strength, including Japan, where same-store sales grew 10%, owing to a strong holiday performance and recent product launch of Tuscani pasta bowls that featured a local flavored twist. At Pizza Hut U.S., which accounts for 7% of our divisional operating profit, Q4 system sales grew 5%, driven by 4% same-store sales growth and flat unit growth. The strength in the quarter was driven by a combination of factors that included new advertising to highlight both premium and value offerings, growth partnerships with aggregators and the success of the new Melts product. Melts over-indexed to predinner time frames and individual occasion tickets and helped to recover the lower household income base due to its strong value proposition. Lastly, 5 distinct national marketing campaigns on Uber Eats and DoorDash helped aggregator transactions grow 30% in the quarter.\nLastly, at the Habit Burger Grill, the team continues to make progress on setting up the business for long-term growth. Habit's burgeoning digital channel finished the year strong with digital mix ending at 35%, a truly impressive level after only launching in 2020. I'm pleased to share that Habit is now 18% franchised, which is up 5 points from last year. With $2 million average unit volumes and a compelling growth strategy, I'm confident in the long-term growth of our newest brand.\nAnd now on to our Unrivaled Culture and Talent Growth drivers. Our hallmark at Yum! continues to be our people first culture, which drives retention and recruitment of amazing talent. Highlights in 2022 included bringing our top 250 leaders from around the world together for a Global Leadership Summit and celebrating the important role our world-class talent has played as we marked our 25th anniversary as a publicly traded company.\nInternally, we continued to promote talent naming a President of the Habit Burger Grill and a new President of KFC U.S. Externally, we attracted top talent, welcoming a new Global Chief Brand Officer for Taco Bell, a new Global Chief Operating and Transformation Officer for Pizza Hut and a new Chief Corporate Affairs Officer for Yum!.\nWhen it comes to all the good we do, we released our 2021 Recipe for Good report during the year, detailing our strong progress around our 3 priority areas. With our science-based targets to decrease greenhouse gas emissions by 46% by 2030, we decreased emissions against our 2019 baseline by approximately 24% for company-owned buildings and our corporate restaurants, while our franchisees decreased emissions by 20%.\nRegarding better packaging, we published a new global harmonized packaging policy with a focus on eliminating unnecessary packaging, shifting to more sustainable materials and supporting better recovery and recycling systems. We increased the number of women in senior leadership globally to 42%, which keeps us on track to achieve gender parity and leadership globally by 2030 in alignment with Paradigm for Parity.\nWe were pleased Yum! received industry-leading rankings on the carbon disclosure project and inclusion on the 2022 Dow Jones Sustainability Index North America, the 2023 Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index and Newsweek's list for America's Most Responsible Companies and America's Greatest Workplaces for Diversity.\nTo wrap up, I'm thrilled with our 2022 performance, particularly given many of the unpredictable obstacles our team had to navigate. Our results continue to reflect a resilient, diversified business and the strength of our portfolio, led by our iconic brands. I'm confident we will continue to execute with superior performance and deliver industry-leading growth, all of which will help to maximize value to our shareholders.\nWith that, Chris, over to you.\n\nChristopher Lee Turner\n\nCFO, Yum! Brands, Inc.\n\nThank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our financial results, our Bold Restaurant Development and Unmatched Operating Capability growth drivers, followed by our capital strategy. As David mentioned, 2022 was a year of huge milestones for Yum!. The resilience and winning mindset shown by our teams around the world helped us open a record-breaking 4,560 gross units or 3,076 net new units on a full year basis. These development numbers put full year unit growth at 6%. System sales for the year grew 8%, driven by strong international same-store sales growth for KFC and another stellar performance from Taco Bell. Full year core operating profit grew 6%, which includes a 2-point headwind from the removal of Russia profits this year.\nFourth quarter system sales growth of 10% was in line with the update we shared at our Investor Day, driven by 6% same-store sales growth and 6% unit growth. Core operating profit grew 22%, which includes a 2-point headwind from the removal of Russia profits this year. Reported operating profit included a negative $42 million foreign currency translation impact in the fourth quarter and a negative $118 million impact to the full year.\nEx special general and administrative expenses came in at $357 million and approximately $1.1 billion for the full year. Taco Bell store level margins were 23%, flat year-over-year. Taco Bell paid additional discretionary bonuses to its store-level employees, given the strong performance for the year, which impacted quarterly margins by approximately 50 basis points. Taco Bell's full year store level margin was 24%, near the upper end of its 23% to 24% historical pre-COVID margin range.\nFourth quarter ex special EPS was $1.31, a 29% increase versus the prior year. EPS growth was positively impacted by core operating profit growth of 22% and a lower current year tax rate. This was partially offset by the year-over-year impact of a current year mark-to-market loss on our equity investment in a franchisee in India, lapping a prior year gain as well as the aforementioned negative impact of foreign currency. The ex special tax rate in the quarter was 12%, due in large part to the release of a valuation allowance associated with deferred tax assets that we now believe we will be able to utilize. Our full year ex special tax rate was 21%, in line with our full year expectations of 21% to 23%.\nNow let me share greater detail on our fourth quarter unit growth in the context of our Bold Restaurant Development growth driver. This quarter, we opened 1,830 gross new units, resulting in 4,560 gross units opened for the full year or the equivalent of more than 1 new restaurant every 2 hours. Nearly 90% of new store openings in 2022 occurred outside the United States across 112 countries, proof that our diversified development engine is stronger than ever.\nStarting with KFC, the team opened 997 gross new units in the fourth quarter with China, India and Thailand leading the charge. The Pizza Hut division had incredible development results, opening 571 gross new units in Q4 with 5 countries contributing more than 25 units, namely India, Indonesia, Canada, China and Turkey. The Taco Bell division opened 253 gross new units in Q4 and 496 restaurants for the full year. In fact, Taco Bell U.S. opened 250 gross new units this year, the second highest annual amount ever.\nFor 2022, Taco Bell International set a record with 246 gross new units, exceeding the prior record of 179 units set last year. I'm thrilled to report we crossed the 1,000 Taco Bell unit threshold internationally and we soon expect to have 4 countries that have over 100 units with China joining Spain, India and the U.K.\nLastly, Habit added 33 gross new units in 2022, representing a year-over-year growth rate of 10%. This level of growth, which includes a significant number of company-owned units create some short-term noise in company-owned restaurant margins due to the inclusion of preopening expenses and the depressed margins that are normal during the initial months of operations before new stores reach maturity. Average margins for Habit stores opened more than a year remain much stronger than our overall reported Habit company store margin.\nTo finish with development, as we head into 2023, we remain confident that we will maintain our strong momentum. We exited 2022 with record site registrations for new units at Taco Bell U.S., and we have over 80% of 2023 planned units at KFC and Pizza Hut outside of China committed with well-capitalized, growth-ready franchise partners.\nNext, I'll discuss our unmatched operating capabilities and the 3 pillars of our digital strategy: Easy Experiences, Easy Operations and Easy Insights. I'll start with an update on our Easy Experiences pillar, which focuses on delivering seamless customer experiences through proprietary technology and dedicated operational programs.\nIn 2022, we expanded the rollout of Tictuk, our conversational commerce and e-commerce platform across our network and finished the year with Tictuk in over 3,200 stores across 49 markets. We processed millions of digital orders in 2022 with Tictuk continuing to prove it can bring in incremental customers and drive digital sales. This is evidenced by the chat ordering launch in KFC Mexico where more than 90% of users who transacted on the chat channel had previously not placed a digital order on other channels. We plan to roll out Tictuk to more than 1,000 new stores in 2023, including its white label e-commerce platform, which went live in Pizza Hut Chile and Taco Bell Canada in Q4 2022.\nMoving on to our Easy Operations pillar, which centers on the team member and franchise partner experience. The rollout of Dragontail is ramping up in Pizza Hut U.S. with over 450 stores onboarded by the end of 2022 and plans to reach up to 1,000 stores by the end of Q1. Globally, we expect to have Dragontail in over 7,000 stores by the end of 2023. At Pizza Hut U.S., we have completed the integration of 2 major aggregator channels into our point-of-sale system. And at Taco Bell U.S., we have fully integrated our delivery as a service partner into our store's technology system. These integrations are important in helping our team members process delivery orders with new levels of ease.\nLastly, I'll cover our Easy Insights pillar, which leverages the power of data and analytics to allow our teams to make smarter decisions. I want to highlight 2 key initiatives that our Yum! decision sciences team have been working on, namely Recommended Ordering and Cook Schedule. Recommended Ordering is an artificial intelligence, machine learning module that predicts and recommends the quantity of product for a restaurant manager to order each week with the goal of reducing product waste and intra-store transfers of inventory. The product has been rolled out to 3,000 U.S. stores across Taco Bell and KFC. Cook Schedule is a similar module that helps predict the correct amount of food and timing to cook product to accurately meet demand. The team is working primarily with KFC on this initiative with plans to pilot in an international market soon.\nFinally, I'll provide an update on our balance sheet and liquidity position. Our net leverage ratio ended the year at 5x, including a small balance on our revolving credit facility that was used to support share repurchases in the fourth quarter. We will enter 2023 with no significant maturities until 2026 and approximately 94% of our debt fixed, excluding our revolving credit facility balance. I will reiterate that our capital priorities are guided by maximizing shareholder value. This includes investing in the business, maintaining a resilient balance sheet, offering a competitive dividend and continuously evaluating the optimal use of our excess cash. To that end, I am also pleased to announce that this week, our Board of Directors approved an increased quarterly dividend of $0.605.\nOur capital expenditures for the quarter, net of refranchising proceeds, were $99 million. Our net capital expenditures for the year came in at $206 million, reflecting $73 million in refranchising proceeds and roughly $279 million in gross CapEx. With regard to our share buyback program, we repurchased 4.1 million shares in the quarter at an average share price of $119 per share, totaling approximately $486 million.\nFor the full year, we repurchased 10 million shares at an average price of $119 per share and totaling $1.2 billion. Overall, we are extremely pleased with these results given the complexities our teams faced. Navigating such challenges with industry-leading performance affirms the confidence we have to deliver our recently raised long-term growth algorithm of 5% unit growth, 7% system sales growth and at least 8% core operating profit growth.\nLooking to 2023, we wanted to provide a few guardrails for modeling purposes. First, we expect to deliver on our long-term growth algorithm with healthy unit growth momentum continuing into 2023. We expect Taco Bell company operated margins to be in line with full year 2022 margins, and we expect our 2023 G&A to be approximately $1.15 billion, in line with the guidance provided at Investor Day. In terms of the shape for the year, the year-over-year growth in G&A will be highest in the first half, largely owing to the timing of our G&A expense plan across the year.\nBased on rate expectations as of today, we expect our interest expense to be up approximately 10% year-over-year and for our leverage ratio to drift modestly lower in 2023. Finally, we expect our full year tax rate to be 21% to 23%.\nTo close, we are extremely proud of the performance of our brands over the past year and look forward with excitement to deliver another year of compelling growth and shareholder value in 2023.\nWith that, operator, we are ready to take any questions."

Brands, Inc. 2024 First Quarter Earnings Call. My name is Nadia, and I'll be coordinating the call today. [Operator Instructions]\nI will now hand over to your host, Matt Morris, Head of Investor Relations to begin. Matt, please go ahead.\n\nMatt Morris\n\nCEO, Stewart Information Services Corp.\n\nThanks, operator. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. On our call today are David Gibbs, our CEO; Chris Turner, our CFO; and Dave Russell, our Senior Vice President and Corporate Controller. Following remarks, we'll open the call to questions.\nBefore we get started, please note that this call includes forward-looking statements that are subject to future events and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. All forward-looking statements are made only as of the date of this call and should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statements in our earnings release and the risk factors included in our filings with the SEC. In addition, please refer to our earnings release and the relevant sections of our filings with the SEC to find disclosures, definitions and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures and other metrics used on today's call.\nPlease note that during today's call, all system sales growth and operating profit growth results exclude the impact of foreign currency. On our last earnings call, we announced that we signed an agreement to acquire 218 KFC franchise restaurants in U.K. and Ireland. The transaction closed on April 29. As a reminder, several of Yum! Brands business units report on a period calendar basis, including all U.S. and Canada brands, KFC U.K. and KFC Australia. For business units that report on a period basis, first quarter same-store sales growth excludes the benefit from the additional day of sales owing to Leap Day. When forecasting 2024, please keep in mind this year will include an extra week in the fourth quarter for those entities. For more information on our reporting calendar for each market, please visit the Financial Reports section of the IR website.\nWe are broadcasting this conference call via our website. This call is also being recorded and will be available for playback. We would like to make you aware of upcoming Yum! investor events and the following. Our second quarter earnings will be released on August 6 with the conference call on the same day. Finally, please mark your calendars for an in-person Taco Bell Consumer Day on December 10 at the Taco Bell headquarters in Irvine, California. Stay tuned for more details and invitations to follow.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to David Gibbs.\n\nDavid W. Gibbs\n\nPresident, Chief Financial Officer & Chief Operating Officer, Yum! Brands, Inc.\n\nThank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report that Yum! grew core operating profit 6% this quarter despite a challenging operating environment, demonstrating the resilience of our business. As we communicated last earnings, 1Q should represent our most challenging sales quarter this year as we work through tough year ago laps returned to a more normal inflationary environment and navigated discrete consumer demand pressures. While the impacts from the Middle East conflict have been scattered and difficult to measure, we've begun to see improvement in the most impacted markets.\nTaco Bell U.S. outperformed the industry on same-store sales and delivered industry-leading margins, while 1Q unit openings at KFC International set us up for a strong unit growth story in 2024. We continue to make significant progress scaling our proprietary digital and AI-powered platforms and are excited by plans to accelerate deployment. Digital sales continued an upward trajectory approaching $8 billion and were up 11% year-over-year. Through continued kiosk deployment, greater adoption of click-and-collect and stable third-party aggregator sales, digital mix improved 5 points and, for the first time ever, represented over 50% of system sales in Q1. We now have $30 billion in annualized digital sales, which by itself would represent one of the largest restaurant companies in the world.\nOverall, despite a more challenged operating environment, we have reached impressive new milestones and remain on track to deliver on our long-term growth algorithm target of at least 8% core operating profit growth for the full year.\nNow I'll discuss our Relevant, Easy and Distinctive brands, or R.E.D. for short, followed by our Unrivaled Culture and Talent and Good Growth strategy. Chris will then provide an update on our first quarter results, followed by our Bold Restaurant Development, Unmatched Operating Capabilities and balance sheet position.\nStarting with the KFC division, which accounts for 51% of our divisional operating profit. KFC grew system sales 4% this quarter, owing to an 8% unit growth and a 2% decline in same-store sales. The same-store sales pressure was partially attributable to impacts from the conflict in the Middle East, which have begun to ease, and we expect a 2-year trend for KFC International overall to accelerate in the same quarter. We saw strong top line growth in other parts of the world including Latin America, Africa and Greater Asia. System sales in Latin America grew 22% on the heels of a strong marketing calendar and continued success of the KFC original nugget. In Africa, system sales grew 11%, thanks to 5% same-store sales growth driven by product innovation and 6% net new unit growth. In Greater Asia where system sales grew 8%, we recently partnered with a new franchisee in Korea, who is driving transaction growth with a calendar focused on core, value and expanding consumer access, which resulted in a 26% growth in same-store sales. At KFC U.S., same-store sales were pressured from unfavorable weather events and chicken value promotions from QSR competitors.\nMoving on to the Taco Bell division, which represents 35% of our divisional operating profit and 75% of our U.S. divisional operating profit. System sales at Taco Bell U.S. grew 4%, led by 2% same-store sales growth and a strong outcome on top of last year's 9% same sales growth. Sales improved throughout the quarter after difficult weather events in January. Taco Bell focused on key levers within its magic formula to drive growth, including building brand buzz, providing value to our consumers and expanding into new category entry points. We know that when we execute on this magic formula, Taco Bell puts itself at the center of the cultural conversation.\nThere was no better example of this than the Live Mas live event Taco Bell held in Las Vegas to share its upcoming innovation calendar, an industry-first event. Of course, it was not surprising that Fast Company named Taco Bell the Most Innovative Company in Dining and #8 overall. Early in the quarter, the team launched a new cravings value menu and ended the quarter with a successful launch of the Chicken Cantina menu. The cravings value menu features industry-leading value with 10 items priced under dollars providing consumers with craveable everyday value offering. Nearly 1/3 of transactions contain an item off the cravings value menu and, when purchased, 80% have at least one other item added, translating to a nearly 10% check uplift compared to noncravings value menu.\nThe impressive performance of such product launches is compounded by Taco Bell's ability to deliver industry-leading margins on top of a great consumer experience. At Taco Bell International, system sales grew 6% this quarter. The team is focused on building brand category awareness globally. This included markets such as Canada and Latin America where the team elevated the core menu and launched the Chicken Cantina menu to expand their consumer base.\nNext, at the Pizza Hut division, which comprises 15% of our divisional operating profit. During the first quarter, system sales declined 4% with 5% unit growth and a 7% decline in same-store sales. The year-over-year growth rate in same-store sales was suppressed from difficult year ago lapse and the ongoing impact from the conflict in the Middle East. The team continued to focus on the individual meal occasion this quarter with the India market launching the Melts platform. At Pizza Hut U.S., same-store sales declined 6% as we lapped the launch of Melts and Big New Yorker Pizza. However, the 2-year trend was positive and improved from last quarter.\nLastly, at The Habit Burger Grill, for the first quarter, system sales declined 2% with 6% unit growth. Margin trends improved throughout the quarter with a combination of initiatives leading to a 60 basis point improvement in store level margins year-over-year.\nNow I'll turn to our Good Growth strategy, starting with our people pillar. Effective June 1, Alex Barsk will join KFC Global as the new Chief Financial Officer. Alex is joining from Pizza Hut, where she most recently served as global CFO. Alex joined Pizza Hut in 2015 and has held several leadership roles across strategy, finance, development and supply chain. Alex's transition is another great example of Yum! leveraging its talent across brands to help share unique learnings and experiences.\nTo round out our people pillar, I'd like to congratulate and thank Yum!'s Senior Vice President of Finance, Corporate Controller and my friend, Dave Russell, who recently celebrated his 25th anniversary at Yum! with today marking his [ 100th ] quarterly earnings announcement. Dave has been with the company since 1999, always serving as a trusted leader who brings his deep knowledge and analytical perspective to our finance and accounting function. Thank you, Dave, for your dedication to our growth over the last 25 years, and I look forward to your continued partnership in the future.\nBefore I hand it over to Chris, I would like to share a few thoughts on the future of our digital and technology strategy given we achieved an important milestone this quarter with more than half of our sales coming from digital. You'll recall that the first phase of our journey to become the leading global digital restaurant company began in earnest in 2019. That first phase focused on building or acquiring a comprehensive suite of owned platforms, spanning Easy Experiences, Easy Operations and Easy Insights and accelerating deployment of those platforms across our brands and markets. While we still have further to go in deploying these platforms, we have achieved critical mass in several areas.\nTaco Bell U.S., one of our twin growth engines, has achieved the most extensive deployment of key platforms, including the Poseidon POS system, the Yum! e-commerce platform and the [ AIM ] inventory management platform. Our other primary growth engine, KFC International, has been accelerating the rollout of those same platforms and is our leader in deploying in-store kiosk technology. Pizza Hut, of course, has been our leader in deploying Dragontail to thousands of restaurants around the globe. Behind the scenes, our global data hub houses data generated from these platforms.\nThe deployment of our capabilities in this first phase of our journey has driven the dramatic increase in our digital sales from approximately 20% in 2019 to over 50% now. The impact of this growth has been significant. To share just a couple of examples of impact, our consumers enjoy more convenient and frictionless experiences, leading to high frequency and check sizes. Our franchisees enjoy significant productivity benefits as their team members no longer spend time taking orders and payments for half of all transactions, leading to stronger unit economics. We believe we are still only scratching the surface of the full value creation potential of our capabilities.\nWhile the first phase of work in deploying our platforms will continue, given the critical mass we have achieved, we have initiated a second parallel phase in our technology journey. This second phase will focus on maximizing the value creation potential of our platforms through the acceleration of AI capabilities in combination with fully leveraging the immense data assets we now own. With our platform-driven approach, we can now more easily integrate AI capabilities across our digital ecosystem. We currently have more than 40 AI initiatives in progress across the company spanning marketing, operations, insights, engineering and our internal back-office functions.\nWhile many of these initiatives will remain confidential for now, one example that we have shared publicly is voice AI to enhance our consumer experience. We've been testing this capability at the drive-thru in 5 Taco Bell stores in California. We are expanding that test to 30 stores in Q2 based on positive consumer feedback. Another example is our piloting of AI-powered technology in our SuperApp restaurant general manager support tool, making it even easier and faster for managers to access critical operational information to make better decisions. Of course, our Dragontail platform was the first AI-enabled next-gen restaurant operational system to enhance the consumer and team member experience in a multichannel fulfillment environment.\nAs an example of how we are elevating the use of our data assets, in Q1, we launched the R.E.D. 360 U.S. Consumer Data Insights system. As of Q1, both Pizza Hut U.S. and Taco Bell U.S. have integrated into the system and KFC U.S. will integrate in the second quarter. This system allows us to leverage insights into consumer behavior across our brands in the U.S. After full deployment, R.E.D. 360 will be the first scaled cross-brand U.S. restaurant consumer data engine in the quick service industry and will pave the way for unique insights and personalization opportunities on digital and social channels.\nFor those who may have missed it, Joe Park, our Chief Digital and Technology Officer, was recently interviewed in The Wall Street Journal, bringing to life many of these plans as we become more focused on pursuing AI and data-driven innovation. As we do all of this, we are also continually innovating how our technology teams work internally to better leverage our scale so that we can continue to bend the curve on the net investment impact of these digital and technology initiatives.\nTo sum it up, we are excited about having ramped up this second phase in our journey and are doubling down and pursuing the ultimate goal of our digital and technology strategy, which is to better serve our franchisees, providing them with more, better, faster, cheaper and safer technology while simultaneously delighting consumers and maximizing Yum! shareholders' returns. We will continue to provide updates on both phases of our journey on future calls, organized around our easy capability framework.\nIn closing, as I look back over the quarter, I'm proud of our teams and their ability to navigate any environment as our brands stand for unmatched value and convenience, providing a range of products and price points to meet any consumers' needs. Our resilient business model, coupled with our strategy to leverage our technology platforms on a global scale, gives me confidence we will continue to improve both franchisee and Yum! economics. Looking ahead, our initiatives to become an even more nimble and data-driven organization are underway, and I'm excited for the shareholder value we will create.\nWith that, Chris, over to you.\n\nChristopher Lee Turner\n\nCFO, Yum! Brands, Inc.\n\nThank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our financial results, our Bold Restaurant Development and Unmatched Operating Capability growth drivers, followed by an update on our balance sheet and capital strategy.\nStarting with our results. First quarter system sales grew by 2% driven by 6% unit growth. As we communicated on our last call, we expected the first quarter to be our most challenged from a same-store sales perspective due to prior year lapse, a return to a more normal inflationary environment and discrete consumer demand pressures, including markets impacted by the Middle East conflict. We believe the markets most impacted by the conflict collectively created a low single-digit headwind on Yum!'s overall Q1 same-store sales. Despite these challenges, I'm pleased to report Yum! delivered 6% core operating profit growth exceeding our internal plan and demonstrating the resilience of our profit model.\nFirst quarter ex special general and administrative expenses were $265 million, down 4% year-over-year, a continuation of the G&A momentum we had in the fourth quarter. Reported G&A was $286 million and includes $21 million in special expense related to ongoing resource optimization, which we expect to generate additional savings in the second half. Reported operating profit included a 2-point impact in the quarter from foreign currency translation. First quarter ex special EPS was $1.15, which includes negative after-tax impacts of $0.08 from investment losses and $0.03 from foreign currency translation.\nAs a reminder, we shared on our last call the intent to purchase 218 KFC U.K. and Ireland stores. We're excited to report we officially closed this acquisition at the end of April. These stores have average unit volumes above $2 million and healthy store level cash margins. We expect the addition of these units to provide approximately $40 million of incremental EBITDA in the 12 months after acquisition while the benefit to our operating profit will be largely offset over the next several years due to depreciation and amortization, including amortization of reacquired franchisees.\nNow let me share greater detail on our first quarter unit growth in the context of our Bold Restaurant Development growth driver. Yum! opened over 800 units in the first quarter. We reached the incredible milestone of opening KFC's 30,000th restaurant globally. As the #1 brand on Entrepreneur Magazine's Top Global Franchise rankings, KFC continues to demonstrate strong desirability among global franchisees with a new store opening every 3 hours. We continue to see an incremental store opportunity of 50,000 KFCs over the long term. Across the global system, the outlook for development in 2024 is strong. We expect to continue to open units in a broad range of markets, which last year included over 100 markets, and to cross the 60,000 unit milestone. Further solidifying Yum!'s position as the world's leading multi-brand restaurant franchisor.\nThere are several reasons we remain confident in these trends. First, we entered 2024 with broad-based development momentum. In Q1, we grew units across 81 brand-country combinations. Second, we have large, committed franchisees who have entered into more unit development commitments for 2024 than in each of the prior 2 years. Approximately 80% of 2024 exceeded new builds for KFC outside of China are part of development commitments. Third, the development white space remains massive. We have just 6% of the global QSR market. China is a prolific developer and serves only 1/3 of the China population. In India, which is the fastest-growing global economy, KFC and Pizza Hut have been the fastest and third fastest-growing QSR chains, respectively, since 2019.\nFinally, our brands unit economics remain attractive across key markets where scale and first-mover advantages put our franchisees in a position of strength. Scale leads to unique advantages including access to alternative financing solutions, dedicated development teams and in-depth market knowledge. Scale also offers operating advantages. For instance, our largest partner, Yum China, has AI-enabled digital tools to allow its restaurant general managers to oversee multiple restaurants, creating unmatched savings that can be passed to consumers.\nThe Serrano Group based in Latin America and Ramcar based in the Philippines run their own poultry processing facilities in addition to distribution capabilities, giving them cost and reliability advantages. At a brand level, KFC has food innovation kitchens in Canada, the U.S., Latin America and the Caribbean, United Kingdom, Thailand, Australia, South Africa, India and Singapore. Perhaps underappreciated, our global innovation capabilities are real sources of differentiation.\nMoving now to the digital and technology front. Recall that our vision is to empower our franchisees with leading-edge technology solutions with advantaged economics. As David put it, we want to deliver more, better, faster, cheaper and safer technology to our franchise partners. We are advantaged by owning important foundational platforms such as our Poseidon POS system, Yum! e-commerce, Dragontail, SuperApp and our global data hub, and the impact of these platforms will grow exponentially as we deploy more of them to more stores. Data is becoming a crucial differentiator, enabling us and our franchisees to generate better insights and make better decisions.\nOn this front, quick service restaurants will benefit disproportionately because of the high frequency nature of our consumer visits, which results in more data. Within quick service, a few characteristics will separate us from our competitors, including our multi-brand portfolio, our scale and global footprint, our ownership of key platforms and the increasing integration between our platforms. We will leverage our data for insights and to drive more effective marketing and loyalty engagement, and we will deploy advanced AI tools to all aspects of our business. As we leverage our scale more and more in these areas, we can be faster, cheaper and safer through consistency and standardization across our environment.\nLet me now discuss the digital and technology accomplishments for Q1 across our Easy Experiences, Easy Operations and Easy Insights pillars. Beginning with our Easy Experiences pillar. We continued to onboard Pizza Hut U.S. to the Yum! e-commerce platform with a full cutover planned by Q3, followed by 3 Pizza Hut international markets by year-end. For Taco Bell U.S., where the Yum! Commerce platform is fully operational, we have accelerated viral promotions and have seen Taco Bell's digital ordering capacity increase tenfold relative to the legacy system.\nWithin Easy Operations, the expansion of our world-class technology products and platforms continued. We expanded Poseidon to 1,800 Taco Bell U.S. restaurants, bringing our total to over 7,000 restaurants. We onboarded over 500 Pizza Hut restaurants onto the Dragontail AI platform, bringing our system total to over 7,000 restaurants. In the near future, we plan to nationally roll out Dragontail's kitchen display system and Poseidon to our KFC U.S. restaurants. Finally, our custom-built SuperApp, which provides smart, automated routine management tools for our restaurant managers, is now used in nearly 9,500 Pizza Hut and KFC restaurants with significant expansion plans underway for KFC.\nFor the third pillar of our Easy strategy, Easy Insights, KFC and Pizza Hut have continued to scale a new experienced management program allowing the brands to draw insights from an expanded source of consumer reviews across digital channels, including third-party aggregators and social media in addition to guest survey responses. KFC is now live in 10,000 restaurants and has seen a fivefold increase in per-store data point. Pizza Hut expanded this service to 7,000 restaurants across more than 50 countries.\nTalking about all of the tremendous advancements underway excites me about the future. This work will be vital as we embark on further innovation behind voice AI, restaurant automation and better leveraging our loyalty programs.\nNext, I'll provide an update on our balance sheet and liquidity position. Net capital expenditures for the quarter were $38 million, reflecting $49 million in gross CapEx and $11 million in refranchising proceeds. Our net leverage ratio ended the quarter at 4.1x. In the quarter, we sold our minority investment in Devyani for $104 million, representing a $73 million increase in value since acquisition. Our cash balance ended at $652 million, reflecting proceeds from the Devyani investment sale and modest accumulation in cash to finance the KFC U.K. acquisition.\nWith the KFC U.K. deal behind us, our cash balance will return to a normalized rate of around $400 million, excluding the unrepatriated Devyani proceeds. Thereafter, with no significant debt maturities in 2024 or 2025, we plan to use our excess free cash flow primarily to fund share repurchases, absent accretive investments we choose to make. I will reiterate that our capital priorities are guided by maximizing shareholder value. This includes investing in the business, maintaining a resilient balance sheet, offering a competitive dividend and returning excess cash to our shareholders.\nSubsequent to the quarter end, we renewed our pro rata credit facility, including our revolving credit facility and Term Loan A. We were pleased to renew the $2 billion facility with the same pricing and terms that we achieved in 2021 while also increasing the revolver from $1.25 billion to $1.5 billion.\nNow let me discuss our latest outlook on full year 2024. We are confident that 2024 will showcase a strong unit development story at or above 5% unit growth, led by KFC International as franchisees capitalize on our brand's attractive paybacks. In the U.S., Taco Bell continues to balance core everyday value to cater to a more discerning consumer across income groups with premium innovation to attract new consumers. We expect full year Taco Bell company-operated margins to be in the range of 23% to 24%. Excluding the 53rd week, we now expect ex special G&A to be flat to down slightly for the year, including incremental G&A associated with the KFC U.K. acquisition. Finally, we are confident we will deliver at least 8% core operating profit growth excluding the benefit of the 53rd week.\nTo close, I am incredibly proud of the progress we have made over the last few years in the areas to which we dedicated our focus and internal resources. Our team continues to manage through industry challenges to position us for a strong year and deliver our long-term operating profit plan, reinforcing the [ brilliance ] of our business, strength of our talent and commitment to our shareholders. Going forward, we are moving to solidify ourselves as the multi-brand franchisor of choice through a more efficient adaptable, data-driven organization. We are only in the early innings of unlocking the value of our unmatched data, which will help power our aspirations and deliver sustained above-market shareholder returns.\nWith that, operator, we are ready to take any questions."

Brands 2024 Second Quarter Earnings Call. My name is Lauren, and I will be coordinating the call today. [Operator Instructions] I will now hand you over to Matt Morris, Head of Investor Relations, to begin. Please go ahead.\n\nMatt Morris\n\nCEO, Stewart Information Services Corp.\n\nThanks, operator. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. On our call today are David Gibbs, our CEO; Chris Turner, our CFO; and Dave Russell, our Senior Vice President and Corporate Controller. Following the remarks from David and Chris, we'll open the call to questions.\nBefore we get started, please note that this call includes forward-looking statements that are subject to future events and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. All forward-looking statements are made only as of the date of this call and should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statement in the earnings release and the risk factors included in our filings with the SEC. In addition, please refer to our earnings release and the relevant sections of our filings with the SEC to find disclosures, definitions and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures and other metrics used on today's call. Please note that during today's call, all system sales growth and operating profit growth results exclude the impact of foreign currency.\nAs a reminder, several of the Yum! Brands business units report on a period calendar basis including all U.S. and Canada brands, KFC U.K. and KFC Australia. When forecasting 2024, please keep in mind this year will include an extra week in the fourth quarter for those entities. For more information on our reporting calendar for each market, please visit the Financial Reports section of the IR website.\nWe are broadcasting this conference call via our website. This call is also being recorded and will be available for playback.\nWe would like to make you aware of the upcoming Yum! investor events and the following. Our third quarter earnings will be released on November 5 with the conference call on the same day. Finally, on our last call, we shared the timing for our talk about consumer date originally planned for December of this year. We are finalizing a revised date for early next year. Please stay tuned for more details and invitations to follow.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to David Gibbs.\n\nDavid W. Gibbs\n\nPresident, Chief Financial Officer & Chief Operating Officer, Yum! Brands, Inc.\n\nThank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. Despite continued challenging operating environment, I'm pleased Yum! was able to deliver 10% growth in core operating profit this quarter, thanks to our team's strong execution and progress on the initiatives laid out on our last call. While we take comfort in improving global trends and still expect the first quarter warrant the low for same-store sales growth, significant volatility remains, and we recognize sales in some markets are not where we want them to be.\nThe impacts from the Middle East conflict, in addition to a more cost-conscious consumer, have presented headwinds to same-store sales. Despite these tougher waters, we are confident we will deliver on profit growth in line with our long-term algorithm for 2024 and are set up for continued strong growth in 2025. Fortunately, we are well positioned to navigate these consumer headwinds given the strength of our brands and reputations for value no matter the environment.\nNonetheless, ensuring we provide consumers affordable options has been an area of greater focus for us since last year with all of our brands having offered disruptive deals and introduced or reintroduced the track of everyday value with examples in the U.S. such as KFC's Taste of KFC deals, Pizza Hut's $7 Deal Lovers and Taco Bell's Cravings Value Menu. As a result, our brands experienced improving trends relative to the first quarter in the U.S. market, and we continue to refine our offerings in international markets to recapture similar momentum.\nThe second quarter offered signs of improving fundamentals. For example, at Taco Bell, we've begun to see sensitivities to check management stabilize to improve from Q1 into Q2, and have witnessed year-over-year check growth led by items per transaction. Internationally, KFC markets excluding China, that we believe were not impacted materially by the Middle East conflict, reported an encouraging mid-single-digit increase in same-store sales.\nAcross our system, our 2024 commodity inflation has come in lower than we expected heading into the year, helping our franchise partners navigate recent sales volatility. Furthermore, momentum in the critical and strategic areas of our business remains strong. This includes robust increases in digital sales, progress leveraging our scale, continued deployment of our proprietary technology ecosystem and efficiency improvements in our cost structure from efforts underway in the next phase of our journey to be a leading global digital restaurant company.\nOur twin growth engines, Taco Bell U.S. and KFC International, helped Yum! deliver 3% system sales growth driven by market share gains at Taco Bell U.S. and strong unit growth at KFC International. Combined, these two powerful business units delivered 7% operating profit growth.\nAt an individual level, unmatched innovation fueled Taco Bell U.S.' 7% increase in system sales with Cantina Chicken performing above our expectations. Taco Bell is a clear standout in today's environment, not only achieving same-store sales growth well ahead of the QSR category, but delivering restaurant-level margins near a record high. In addition, Taco Bell's same-store sales grew mid-single digits across all income cohorts, proving that craveable innovation even at a higher price point wins with today's consumers.\nAt KFC International, on a quarter-over-quarter basis, same-store sales showed strong improvement on a 2-year trend, and unit growth in the quarter was an impressive 9% year-over-year as franchisees take advantage of strong paybacks. I know from experience, this powerful brand is not constrained by expansion opportunity, but rather its growth and success are tied closely with having the right franchise partner. This is why we are very intentional about who we choose to allow into our system.\nFor example, our new franchise partner in South Korea took over in April 2023 and has drastically improved performance with same-store sales up 17% this quarter. In that vein, the KFC team is tirelessly working to give our franchisees the tools to succeed, including furthering the expansion of Super App and the KFC global loyalty program, which is now live in 14 markets.\nNow I'll discuss our relevant, easy and distinctive brands or R.E.D for short, followed by our unrivaled culture and talent and good growth strategy. Chris will provide an update on our second quarter results, followed by our bold restaurant development, unmatched operating capabilities and balance sheet position and capital strategy.\nBeginning with the KFC division, which accounts for 49% of our divisional operating profit, we grew system sales 2% led by 8% unit growth. Our same-store sales were down 3%, largely on account of scattered pockets of weakness in a number of markets relating to the Middle East conflict and underperformance in the U.S. market. This quarter, we did not see any improvement in the most directly impacted markets. If Q2 trends hold, the pressure on same-store sales growth for the set of directly impacted markets will begin to abate as we lap the prior year's sales impact beginning in November.\nBeyond the most significantly impacted markets of the Middle East, Malaysia and Indonesia, we've seen sales impacts from the Middle East conflict surface in several other markets based on store performance comparisons across neighborhoods.\nIn other parts of the world, we witnessed trends improved from the first quarter, including Canada and Central and Eastern Europe, while South Africa's transactions began to improve during the quarter.\nAnother exciting development in the quarter was Yum China celebrating its 200th K Coffee, which consists of an adjacent storefront that is part of an existing KFC, allowing a reduced investment and lower operating costs from sharing KFC kitchen facilities. The Yum China team has averaged one new K Coffee per day since the beginning of 2024. While these do not count as new units in our system, they are a driver of future same-store sales growth. This quarter, we acquired 216 KFC restaurants in the U.K. and Ireland, and we have started to optimize restaurant operations there. Lastly, KFC digital sales, excluding China grew nearly 20% with an impressive 40% growth in kiosk sales.\nMoving on to the Taco Bell division, which represents 37% of our divisional operating profit. U.S. same-store sales grew 5%, outpacing the U.S. QSR industry by a wide margin. Taco Bell executed its winning formula this quarter through introducing a variety of compelling innovations such as the Cheez-It and secret [ Aardvark Fries ]. The second quarter often reflected sales contribution from the Cantina Chicken menu, our foray into an elevated chicken offering and a new platform to innovate around. Since the platform launch, Taco Bell's chicken sales mix has increased 10 points with nearly 1 in 4 orders, including a Chicken Cantina item.\nAnother part of the team's winning formula is digital in which digital sales continue to grow at a breakneck pace. In Q2, Taco Bell's loyalty sales were up over 30%.\nAt Taco Bell International, the team is working on building brand relevance. It is still early days in many markets and trends remain volatile but we remain confident in the long-term opportunity. A restored emphasis on value has forced our teams to be creative with a limited national marketing budget. In more mature markets within Europe, which accounts for over 40% of Taco Bell International system sales, we saw encouraging signs of improvement with the introduction of value offers.\nNext, I'll discuss our Pizza Hut division, which accounts for 14% of our divisional operating profit. System sales [ were flat ] this quarter and units expanded 3% year-over-year. International same-store sales remained negative in part because of a stalled recovery in Malaysia and Indonesia. We're encouraged Pizza Hut same-store sales -- have improved 4 points from last quarter with progressing trends in the U.S. and encouraging recoveries in Thailand and Hong Kong.\nAround the world, our team is actively expanding [ My Hut Box ] introducing [ Melts ], including most recently in India and Thailand. Both platforms lift underdeveloped dayparts, expand individual meal occasions and provide attractive price points to our consumers. Since joining Pizza Hut as CEO in 2021, Aaron Powell has assembled an amazing team and is providing strong leadership to drive efficiency, increase accountability, reduce complexity and align the brand to consumer trends. In the U.S., momentum accelerated throughout the quarter with an increase in weekly per restaurant average transactions attributable to a number of value-based promotions and the launch of My Hut Box.\nLastly, at the Habit Burger Grill, second quarter system sales declined 1%. Habit's restaurant count increased 5% year-over-year as a result of new regulations in Habit's home market of California that have raised the cost to business, Habit's leadership team has been focused on protecting profitability to remain competitive. Those efforts led to a comprehensive store level labor optimization effort, which contributed to an impressive 520 basis point expansion of restaurant level margins from the first quarter despite a double-digit increase in restaurant level labor rates in California stores.\nSame-store sales growth remained suppressed, but we're encouraged by the improvement from first quarter trends despite a more challenged regional backdrop. Subsequent to quarter end, I was pleased to learn Habit's Double Charred Burger, reigned supreme in USA TODAY's 10 Best Readers' Choice Award for Best Quick Service Burger, landing the #1 spot and beating out all other QSR and better burger competitors.\nNow I'll turn to our good growth strategy, start with our people pillar. One of Yum!'s hallmarks is our people-first culture, which drives recruitment of amazing talent and also builds a deep bench of leaders within the organization. I'm excited about the great work going on at Pizza Hut from a talent perspective, where we recently welcomed [ Karl Laredo ] as the brand's U.S. President. Karl is a seasoned marketing leader with deep experience in delivering impressive results at some of the world's largest and best-known brands. We also welcomed former PepsiCo Executive, [ Calin Thornton ] as Global Chief Brand Officer, leading the Pizza Hut division's global brand strategy and marketing, including harnessing the power of engaging consumer connections across physical and digital touch points.\nIt is also rewarding to see leaders from Yum!'s deep bench of talent assume bigger roles. [ Melissa Freebay ] recently joined Pizza Hut U.S. as Chief Marketing Officer, after spending 27 years at Taco Bell in various finance, marketing, insights and brand strategy positions.\nIn addition to recruiting and promoting talent and professionals, we're furthering our culture of collaboration and building capability across our company in powerful forums such as KFC's annual global marketing planning meeting. KFC gathered marketing leaders, franchise partners and vendors from around the world to share best practices and consumer insights to keep our iconic brand R.E.D, discuss innovative strategies and sale of delicious products from various markets.\nMoving on to the planet pillar of our Good Growth strategy. We are making progress on our global goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions nearly 50% by 2030 with a focus on renewable energy and energy efficiencies in our restaurants and ongoing collaboration with our food suppliers. For example, KFC has reduced emissions by focusing on key areas such as cooking and holding systems, refrigeration and cooling and lighting while Pizza Hut and Taco Bell are collaborating with partners to reduce on-farm emission and encourage sustainable practices.\nIn terms of packaging, we are making progress against our global goals with many markets eliminating unnecessary plastic items like straws, cup lids, stirrers and cutlery. And finally, we're also making a meaningful impact in the communities we serve by continuing to unlock opportunities. As an example, in Thailand, KFC partnered with nonprofit and the Thai government to launch the country's first-ever flexible learning curriculum to help students who dropped out of school, gain critical job and entrepreneurial skills.\nTo wrap up before handing over to Chris, we are pleased our second quarter built to a 10% growth in core operating profit despite system sales pressures. While our teams work to prove system sales trends, we are confident the investments we are making in tandem to be more agile, resilient and stronger as part of the next phase in our technology journey will lead to a promising year in 2025. All these efforts underscore our commitment to be the franchisor of choice and deliver more, better, faster, cheaper and safer technology services to our partners.\nI'm excited about our plans to harness the power of AI, including the expansion of drive-through Voice AI technology with plans to roll this capability out to hundreds of Taco Bell U.S. stores by year-end in addition to testing with KFC in an international market. We are hard at work driving the next phase of our technology journey to unlock future growth by strengthening our business resilience and ensuring we deliver exceptional shareholder value in the years ahead.\nWith that, Chris, over to you.\n\nChristopher Lee Turner\n\nCFO, Yum! Brands, Inc.\n\nThank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our financial results, our bold restaurant development and unmatched operating capability growth drivers, our balance sheet and capital strategy and provide an update on our outlook for the remainder of the year.\nBeginning with our second quarter results. System sales grew 3%, driven by 5% unit growth. Consumer sentiment relating to the conflict in the Middle East continued to pressure system sales growth in the quarter. The recovery trajectory we observed in Q1 for the Middle East, Malaysia and Indonesia, flattened in Q2. And while hard to precisely quantify, we continue to observe conflict-related impacts in a broader set of markets. Despite these pressures, Yum! delivered an impressive 10% core operating profit growth reflecting the resilience of our scale, multi-brand business model, the increasing benefits of our digital and technology strategy and the expert management of the business by our leaders around the globe.\nA prime example of factors underpinning our resilience was profitability in our 488 company-owned Taco Bell stores in the U.S., our single largest estate of company-owned stores representing approximately half of our total global company-owned store revenue. Store level margins were 25.6% with mature stores achieving over 27%, reflecting the strength of the Taco Bell business model and its magic formula, which enables the brand to simultaneously deliver an outstanding consumer experience, tremendous consumer value and exceptional store-level margins for our franchisees and Yum! Importantly, Taco Bell operations leaders are taking advantage of the continued growth in digital sales mix which is now 35% to further digitally enable our operations in ways that not only improve consumer -- experiences, but also improve labor productivity.\nAnother contributor to profit growth was improved expense leverage. As we shared in January, we expected throughout the year to see the benefits of our ongoing resource optimization program, which strategically leverages our scale to free up general and administrative expense for reinvestment in future growth drivers such as AI, which will benefit both Yum! and our franchisees in addition to some beneficial onetime G&A expense overlaps. Second quarter ex-special G&A expense was $256 million, down [ 9% ] year-over-year. Reported G&A was $281 million, reflecting $25 million of special expense related to our resource optimization program. We expect to generate additional savings on an ex-special basis from the resource optimization program in the second half of the year.\nReported operating profit increased 6% as foreign currency translation continued to be a headwind with a $12 million negative impact in the quarter. Historically, given our global footprint, foreign currency translation has at times been a significant tailwind to our reported operating profit and at other times, a headwind. Since interest rates in the U.S. began to rise in Q1 2022, our current annual operating profit reflects a headwind of nearly $180 million in foreign currency, equivalent to roughly 1 year of operating profit growth under our long-term growth algorithm during that period.\nSecond quarter ex-special EPS was $1.35, reflecting a $0.20 negative impact from a higher year-over-year tax rate and lower year-over-year investment gains. Additionally, foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted Q2 EPS by $0.03.\nMoving on to our bold restaurant development growth driver. Yum! opened 894 units, the second highest number of Q2 gross openings in Yum!'s history, leading to our unit count expanding 5% year-over-year, contributing 4 points to total system sales growth. In the quarter, we transferred certain rights related to the trademarks of the [ Gino's Pizza and Telepizza ] brands in Latin America to our local franchisee, enabling our teams in Latin America to focus exclusively on driving growth in the Pizza Hut brand. As a result, we removed 120 low volume and low royalty rate units associated with those brands from our store base in exchange for nominal compensation. Excluding the impact of this transfer, our unit growth was 6%. Our growth remains diversified across brands and countries with 195 brand country combinations contributing growth during the last 12 months.\nMoving to brand-specific development. In the KFC division, we opened 598 units across 57 countries. This brings our year-to-date gross openings in KFC to 1,107 units, a new all-time record for KFC for the first half of the year. China, India, Thailand and Japan led development. Over the last year, we've seen positive development trends in South Africa, the Philippines and Brazil. In the quarter, we closed on the transaction to purchase 216 stores in the U.K. and Ireland, one of our highest average annual unit volume markets. Our total equity estate at KFC is now 434 stores, the majority of which are located in the U.K. market.\nThe Pizza Hut division opened 236 units across 30 countries. Pizza Hut's year-over-year unit growth is trending higher from this time last year for several of our largest markets, including China and Japan, which is offsetting closures in the U.S. and the conflict-related slowing of development in Indonesia and Malaysia.\nAt Taco Bell, we opened 56 units this quarter, including 17 new units in our international markets across 10 countries. Our U.S. gross openings are running higher year-over-year for the first half, and we expect international store growth to pick up in the second half of the year. Excluding China, Taco Bell international unit count was up 7% year-over-year.\nMoving to our digital and technology initiatives. You will recall that on our last earnings call, David and I discussed our journey to become the leading global digital restaurant company. The first phase of this journey is focused on acquiring, building and scaling a comprehensive suite of owned platforms that enable ownership of our data, control of the digital ecosystem, speed of innovation and cost advantages through scale leverage. Within this phase, we are accelerating deployment of our foundational platforms, such as the Poseidon POS system, the Yum! e-commerce platform, Dragontail, Super App and our Global Data Hub. In the next phase, we are focused on maximizing the value creation potential of our platforms through AI and leveraging our extensive data assets.\nData is becoming a crucial differentiator, enabling us and our franchisees to generate better insights and make better decisions. We believe we are still only scratching the surface of the full value creation potential of our capabilities.\nLet me now discuss additional digital and technology accomplishments for Q2 across our easy experiences, easy operations and easy insights pillars. I will begin with our easy experience pillar, focused on providing frictionless experiences to our consumers. As you recall, last quarter, we discussed plans to expand drive-through Voice AI technology to more Taco Bell stores. I'm excited to announce that given our encouraging early results, the team has accelerated the rollout. And as of today, we now have this technology operational in over 100 Taco Bell stores. We plan to scale the technology to several hundred stores by year-end, while the pilot test is underway in KFC Australia. In our tests, we have witnessed consistent consumer experiences and higher team member productivity. This technology leverages digital menu boards, which will be a Taco Bell brand standard in 2025 and Yum!'s proprietary point-of-sale system, Poseidon.\nOn the e-commerce front, we have made significant progress in implementing the Yum! Commerce platform at Pizza Hut U.S. We are currently transitioning to this platform at Pizza Hut in the U.K., which will be the second international Pizza Hut market to operate on the Yum! Commerce platform to Pizza Hut Canada next in line.\nNext, I'll discuss our easy operations pillar, where we continue to deploy our world-class technology to provide our franchisees and team members with the capabilities to operate their stores more effectively and efficiently. We have fully deployed our Poseidon point-of-sale system within Taco Bell U.S. and are in the early stages of incorporating this system into the KFC U.S. estate. With respect to Dragontail, our AI-enabled restaurant management system, we plan to have the system rolled out to nearly the entire Pizza Hut U.S. system by year-end. As an example of Dragontail's impact, in the first 1,000 Pizza Hut U.S. stores to implement the technology, we have measured a 7% increase in overall consumer satisfaction due to hotter and fresher pizzas leading to improved consumer frequency. Finally, we are in the process of scaling -- our restaurant General Manager support app at Pizza Hut U.S., and we plan to achieve the 10,000 store milestone across KFC globally by year-end.\nLastly, I'll discuss our easy insights pillar. We deepened our AI pursuits this quarter, taking steps to unlock the benefits of our R.E.D 360 database and engage with an innovative start-up in the AI-driven personalization space to leverage our massive first-party data assets. This partnership covers the application and integration of a deep learning AI approach known as reinforcement learning, which we expect to be broadly and easily scalable across brands. This partnership will focus on our basic CRM channels and in the future, may extend to our other consumer sales and communications channels, for instance, paid media.\nNext, I'll provide an update on our balance sheet and liquidity position. As a reminder, our capital priorities are guided by maximizing shareholder value and include investing in the business, maintaining a resilient balance sheet, offering a competitive dividend and returning excess cash to our shareholders. Net capital expenditures for the quarter were $31 million, reflecting $50 million in gross CapEx and $19 million in refranchising proceeds. Our net leverage ratio ended the quarter at 4.1x. We have a strong balance sheet and no debt maturities until 2026.\nDuring the second quarter, we are pleased to have resumed share repurchases by buying back $50 million in our stock, which for context is the same value of shares repurchased during the entire year of 2023. Going forward, absent any attractive investment opportunities like our recent acquisition of KFC U.K. restaurants, we plan to continue to return excess cash flow to shareholders through share repurchases.\nFinally, I'll discuss our outlook on the balance of 2024. We remain on track to achieve 5% unit growth for the full year despite the extended impact of the Middle East conflict. On a global basis, our planned number of gross unit openings for the full year is expected to be similar to our number of gross openings in 2023. We should also note some certainty on the future path in the Middle East markets. For example, there are approximately 210 restaurants currently temporarily closed across the Middle East, Malaysia and Indonesia. While there are plans in place to reopen some of those restaurants starting later this month and throughout the second half of the year, there is risk that some could close permanently pending the future trajectory of the conflict impact. These stores have not been producing royalties while temporarily closed, but our reported unit count would be negatively impacted if these stores were to permanently close.\nWith respect to company store profitability, we expect full year Taco Bell company-operated store margins to be in the range of 23% to 24%.\nRegarding G&A. Excluding the 53rd week, we now expect ex-special G&A expense to be lower on a year-over-year basis by a low single-digit percentage. As for sequencing, Q3 G&A will be higher year-over-year as we lap last year's recovery of cyber-related insurance proceeds and as we incur costs relating to our Global Leadership Summit. Finally, despite updating our balance of year sales outlook to reflect the continued softness we're seeing tied to the Middle East conflict, we remain confident that we will deliver at least 8% core operating profit growth on a full year basis excluding the benefit of the 53rd week.\nI'm very proud of the work our teams continue to do to position Yum! as a resilient growth business going forward and to further cement Yum! as the global franchisor of choice. We are making incredible strides toward our distinctive digital and technology ambitions, our 50% plus digital sales mix and our continued rollout of distinctive digital and AI technologies are testaments to that pursuit.\nIn markets around the world, we have the privilege of working with outstanding 3C that is capable, well-capitalized and committed franchisees who want to grow with our system and our iconic brands.\nWith that, operator, we are ready to take any questions."

All forward-looking statements are made only as of the date of this call and should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statements in our earnings release and the risk factors included in our filings with the SEC.\nIn addition, please refer to our earnings release and relevant section filings with the SEC to find disclosures, definitions and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures and other metrics used on today's call.\nPlease note that during today's call, all system sales growth and operating profit growth results exclude the impact of foreign currency.

Looking ahead, our fourth quarter earnings will be released on February 7 with the conference call on the same day.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to David Gibbs.\n\nDavid W. Gibbs\n\nPresident, Chief Financial Officer & Chief Operating Officer, Yum! Brands, Inc.\n\nThank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. Before I go over our third quarter results, I'd like to express our deep concern for those affected by the ongoing violence in Israel and Gaza. The safety of our people in the region is our utmost priority. And in addition to staying in close contact with our local team members and franchisees, our franchise restaurants in the region are only open when it is safe for staff and customers. Yum! is supporting affected employees and contributing to humanitarian organizations that are providing critical aid. Our heartfelt wish is for the safety and well-being of innocent civilians and families in the region impacted by this conflict.\nTurning to our third quarter results, which once again reflect our ability to grow our iconic brands globally through our Recipe for Good growth. I'm proud to share that we delivered 10% system sales growth, led by 6% same-store sales growth and 6% unit growth. We set a Q3 record on unit development, opening an incredible 1,130 gross new units in the quarter. Our digital sales growth remains on fire with sales up more than 20% year-over-year and digital sales setting a record by exceeding $7 billion.\nOur third quarter core operating profit grew an impressive 16%. KFC International and Taco Bell U.S., which collectively contribute approximately 80% of our divisional operating profit, fueled this quarter's growth. Together, these twin growth engines delivered a remarkable 13% system sales growth in the quarter.\nKFC International has the most units among quick-service restaurants in 60 countries and has been adding more absolute units than any other retail brand in the world since 2021. Of course, Taco Bell U.S. is in a class of its own in the domestic QSR category as a culturally iconic brand and clear leader in value perception with the most crave-worthy food in the industry. Taco Bell has unmatched menu flexibility, exceptional pricing power, industry-leading unit economics and world-class franchise partners. Both businesses are performing at extremely high levels and have ambitious plans to accelerate their growth to even greater heights.\nNow let me discuss the quarter's results in greater detail through the lens of two of our growth drivers: Relevant, easy and distinctive or R.E.D brands, and unrivaled culture and talent. R.E.D brands are the cornerstone of our strategy and the way we bring this to life continues to evolve as consumers' behaviors shift and new trends are established. Over the past quarter, we have made significant progress in three specific initiatives: Building sales layers through new category entry points, leveraging technology to drive brand loyalty and delivering exciting value offers to broaden appeal. Our brand teams are galvanized around these three focus areas, and we are highly encouraged by the results these areas are driving in our divisions which I will now highlight.\nStarting with the KFC division, which grew system sales 12% this quarter, driven by 8% unit growth and 6% same-store sales growth. While much of KFC's recent momentum has been led by emerging markets, this quarter, we saw a broad-based strength across a more diverse group of geographies, further proof of our ability to win in any macro environment. A few markets with standout same-store sales growth performance include Africa at 9% growth, Australia with 9% growth and Latin America and Caribbean at 8%.\nKFC hand-breaded original recipe nuggets are a global innovation platform and represent a new category entry point to attract individuals and families. After a successful launch in the U.S., we expanded nuggets to our Latin America and Caribbean market this quarter and saw incredible consumer reception that helped drive significant sales. The team plans to expand the offering to several more places around the world.\nKFC Africa delivered their 11th consecutive quarter of same-store sales growth with a combination of abundant value offers, strong e-commerce sales and the relaunch of their breakfast campaign driving this quarter's performance.\nFinally, I want to highlight our KFC Australia business as they continue to deliver fantastic performance with kiosk sales growing more than 90% compared to last year and the advent of a highly personalized value campaign that drove significant owned channel sales.\nThe KFC global team is -- great progress in expanding its loyalty program around the world, including in the U.S. where we soon expect to launch KFC Rewards.\nNext, I'll discuss our Taco Bell division, which delivered 11% system sales growth in Q3, led by 8% same-store sales growth and 5% unit growth. At Taco Bell U.S., system sales grew 11% with an impressive 8% same-store sales growth and 3% unit growth. The Taco Bell team leveraged its magic formula that encompasses a balanced set of commercial strategies, including building brand buzz, unparalleled value, [ mock ] occasions and digital initiatives to grow transactions during the quarter. They delivered unparalleled value with the return of fan favorites like the $5 box, an amazing platform at a compelling price point.\nThough Taco Bell featured a great value promotion in the quarter, value purchases remained within range of the brand's intended 10% mix target. This, combined with exciting innovation and brand buzz, helped the brand maintain its industry-leading margins of 24%.\nA key component of the magic formula is [ mass ] occasions, the brand's personal expression of building new category entry points. One such example is the growth in chicken offerings, which the team plans to further expand with the launch of its Cantina menu. We're excited about the impact these new menu items will have -- roll out these offerings in 2024.\nAnother component of this brand's success is digital, which includes loyalty. While a Taco Bell loyalty customer already spends 40% more per year than a traditional customer, the consumer feedback we've received indicates that we can do an even better job at creating more obvious and exciting ways to both earn and redeem rewards.\nStarting next year, Taco Bell will enhance its loyalty program and provide easier access across channels to earn and redeem points. Additionally, members will enjoy more exclusive experiences, including more digital innovation, early access to new products and loyalty enabled and experiences. Eventually, the team will integrate its loyalty program with digital menu boards to create an even more personalized experience.\nTaco Bell International delivered 16% system sales growth driven by 23% unit growth and 1% same-store sales growth. A key contributor to Taco Bell's international business has been robust digital sales, which increased nearly 45% year-over-year this quarter.\nThe global Taco Tuesday campaign that launched in June continued to drive customer engagement around the globe, bringing greater brand awareness and equity with consumers. The international markets are focused on amplifying National Taco Day and providing consumers with both craveable food and -- value.\nTurning to the Pizza Hut division, which grew system sales 4% driven by 4% unit growth and 1% same-store sales growth. International same-store sales grew 2%, driven by transaction growth in China, continued momentum in Melts and more strategically activating aggregator partnerships in international markets. Same-store sales results in the U.S. were flat as Pizza Hut leaned into its long-term strategy to build new category entry points through individual meal occasions with products like Melts and wings.\nThis quarter, Pizza Hut U.S. teamed up with the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles to relaunch our big New Yorker pizza and deliver pizzas into the New York subway stations, leading to over 1 billion media impressions. As we head into the fourth quarter, the Pizza Hut U.S. team launched a late night initiative, strategically expanding operating hours in more than 1,000 restaurants to give consumers even more ways to access the brand.\nTo wrap up with the Habit Burger Grill, system sales grew 4%, driven by 8% unit growth. The new Habit leadership team is settling in well and has placed a distinct focus on building strong unit level economics to set the brand up for long-term success. Of note, the team is developing a new cost-effective packaging range designed for off-premise occasions, along with a new prototype store to optimize CapEx and preopening costs.\nThe Habit is set to launch its first everyday value platform in November called Simple Craft after a successful test this quarter. We have tremendous confidence in the long-term prospects of this brand and are encouraged by the improvements that the team is making to deliver success in the future.\nNow I'll turn to our good growth strategy, starting with our people pillar. We've held powerful forms this quarter, supporting our unrivaled culture and talent growth driver including a leadership development conference for underrepresented talent and a new program aimed at preparing high potential female talent to be part of the next generation of senior leadership.\nIn addition, we're furthering our culture of collaboration and building capability across our company. Recently, a cross-brand group of leaders gathered for the first R.E.D innovation experience in our innovation lab, where they learned design thinking and real-time problem-solving through new age innovation techniques.\nWe're also making a meaningful impact in the communities we serve through our global unlocking opportunity initiative to create more equality. For example, in the U.K., KFC partnered with a nonprofit with the goal of having 1/3 of its new hires be at risk youth. In Sri Lanka, Pizza Hut is investing in the development of 30 vocational and technical training facilities to prepare youth for careers in the QSR industry.\nIn terms of our planet pillar and our focus on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, we're educating suppliers through the supplier leadership and climate transition, a consortium of multinational companies created to accelerate climate action in the supply chain. Many of Yum!'s poultry, beef and dairy suppliers in key markets have joined this program or already have emissions reduction goals. These are just a few of the examples of the great work of our teams, earning us recognition like Newsweek's 2023 America's Greenest companies.\nOverall, we're incredibly pleased with our results for the quarter and year-to-date. Our strategy is clear and the emphasis we are placing on building sales layers through new category entry points, leveraging technology to drive brand loyalty and delivering exciting value offers to broaden appeal is going to drive our business forward even faster.\nAs we conclude our internal annual operating plan views and look forward to 2024, it's clear we have the very best teams in place and are perfectly set up to capture an even greater share of a growing global QSR market and deliver compelling shareholder value going forward.\nWith that, Chris, over to you.\n\nChristopher Lee Turner\n\nCFO, Yum! Brands, Inc.\n\nThank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our financial results, our Bold Restaurant Development and unmatched operating capability growth drivers followed by an update on our balance sheet and capital strategy.\nI'll begin by discussing our strong results for Q3. We achieved 10% system sales growth driven by 6% same-store sales growth and 6% unit growth. Our digital sales channels continue to grow with digital sales setting another record this quarter, exceeding $7 billion, an increase of more than 20% year-over-year. Core operating profit grew an impressive 16%.\nTaco Bell delivered another quarter of exceptional performance, achieving 24% restaurant-level margins while simultaneously driving transaction growth.\nGlobal ex-special, general and administrative expenses were $263 million lower than expected in part due to timing, with some expenses shifting into the fourth quarter. Our ex-special tax rate of 19% was lower year-over-year. Lastly, our EPS, excluding special items, was $1.44 per share. Ex-special EPS was positively impacted by $0.05 of unrealized investment gains related to our investment in Devyani.\nI'd now like to give a little bit of color on the remainder of the year. We're proud to say that we continue to expect that our results will land well above our long-term growth algorithm for the full year, including achieving low double-digit core operating profit growth. On the fourth quarter specifically, we now expect an operating loss at Habit of approximately $10 million, largely driven by restaurant asset impairment charges which will be higher than we had initially expected due to anticipated impacts from the California Assembly Bill 1228, previously referred to as the FAST Act. Even with the previously mentioned timing shift of G&A expenses, we still expect fourth quarter G&A to be slightly lower year-over-year.\nMoving to reported operating profit. We now expect foreign currency translation to represent a $45 million to $55 million headwind on a full year basis. Finally, we expect our ex-special full year tax rate to land at approximately 20%.\nNext, I'll cover our Bold Restaurant Development growth driver. We are on track to finish 2023 with net new unit development similar to the record-breaking performances of the last 2 years. This quarter's 6% growth in unit count led by a Q3 record of 1,130 gross new openings across 65 countries reflects the continued success of our multiyear effort to accelerate development across our brands.\nBy now, you've seen the announcement at Yum China's recent investor conference, raising their unit growth expectations for our brands in China. This announcement highlights continued strong returns on new restaurant development in our brands in combination with the best-in-class development capabilities that Yum China leadership team have built in the market.\nMore broadly, we continue to see excitement for our brands all around the world. As an example, in Vietnam, a market with a high population but relatively low Yum! restaurant penetration, our unit count increased by over 40 units versus last year, reflecting 16% growth. In total, this quarter, KFC achieved 8% unit growth, including 664 gross new units, a Q3 record for the brand. This was led by Yum China, along with our franchisees in India, Sapphire and Devyani, and IS Holdings in Turkey.\nAt Pizza Hut, we opened 383 gross new units with more than 30 markets contributing to this growth. Our Taco Bell division opened 74 gross new units, led by the U.S., China and India.\nIn the midst of a higher interest rate environment, our world-class 3C franchise partners are stepping up and investing to grow share. One of those exceptional franchisees is the Serrano Group, our partner for KFC in multiple countries in Latin America. In just the past 3 years, the Serrano Group has opened over 100 net new units, quadrupling their store count from the past 10 years and building world-class assets that reflect how dynamic and tech forward our brand is in this region.\nBuilding a network of growth-minded franchise partners is no easy task. It requires persistent effort to identify and engage with like-minded partners to consistently deliver on brand standards, growth ambitions and mutually shared financial objectives, all of which add up to long-term profitable growth for all parties and competitive advantage for our brands.\nWhile we focus on having the right partners, we also work to ensure we have the right restaurant formats and economic models in place. All of our brands are laser-focused on delivering industry-leading franchisee returns by continuously optimizing new store CapEx as well as maintaining a flexible portfolio of formats that meet the unique needs of each trade zone in which we operate.\nTaco Bell's newest small box design, Go Mobile 2.0, now open in El Paso, Texas, builds on the original Go Mobile concept. This new design leverages digital capabilities to create more touch points for consumers to order and pick up in a seamless manner.\nMoving on to our unmatched operating capability growth driver. We continue to focus on delivering a seamless digital experience for our consumers, enabling easier operations for our team members and harnessing our expansive data to make fast and informed decisions. We frame up this approach through three lenses: Easy experiences, easy operations and easy insights.\nWithin easy experiences, we successfully rolled out the Yum! Commerce platform to the Taco Bell system last quarter and are in the process of rolling the platform out to the Pizza Hut U.S. system, transitioning our brands on to Yum! owned platforms allows us to scale new capabilities at a rapid pace and build out an ecosystem of proprietary platforms that are designed to work together in a secure and seamless fashion.\nOur primary focus is to deliver leading-edge capabilities to our franchisees with advantaged economics, and our franchisees continue to co-invest with us as we develop and roll out our solutions.\nOne exciting area of growth is the implementation of in-store kiosks. We now have kiosks in nearly 40% of KFC stores outside of China. All of our Taco Bell U.S. locations, excluding licensed stores and almost 70% of our -- locations. Looking forward, for our KFC stores outside of China, we expect to drive a 20-point increase in our kiosk penetration next year on the way to reaching the vast majority of stores by the end of 2026.\nKiosks not only drive a higher check compared to our traditional front counter, but also drive higher margins through operational efficiencies and generate new opportunities to leverage customer data and create personalized ordering experiences.\nWithin easy operations, we're on track to have our recommended ordering technology, which we're calling AIM, or automated inventory management, rolled out across our KFC U.S. system by year-end. As a reminder, this is an in-house developed AI module that predicts and suggests the quantity of each product a restaurant general manager should order. We now have AIM in place at over 7,000 U.S. restaurants, including 2,700 KFC U.S. restaurants added over the past quarter.\nThere is also great momentum behind the Dragontail rollout. We have deployed Dragontail, an AI-driven production and delivery sequencing platform, to nearly 1,400 Pizza Hut U.S. stores as of the end of the quarter, and are on track to have Dragontail deployed to around 8,000 restaurants globally by year-end, further proof of our unique ability to scale Yum! owned technologies around the world.\nWe have made significant progress in 2023, building, testing and refining our proprietary technology platforms. In 2024, we will further scale these platforms and continue to realize the value of our owned tech ecosystem.\nFinally, we are excited about the new technologies. Our R.E.D innovation team is in the early stages of piloting in restaurants to support our franchisees and free up team member time to allow them to focus even more on delivering world-class customer experiences.\nFirst, we are testing a voice-enabled AI drive-thru platform in a couple of our restaurants in California that elevates the drive-thru experience, increases speed, productivity and efficiencies and generates automated upsell recommendations.\nSecond, we have developed a proprietary automated drinks fulfillment system that frees up team member time and increases drive-thru speed and accuracy. We've designed these technologies to integrate seamlessly with our proprietary -- point-of-sale platform, and we look forward to continuing to test, refine and pilot these capabilities.\nWrapping up with our easy insights pillar. I'm very excited by the progress we have made in building the infrastructure and engineering capabilities required to harness the power of our global data assets. We continue to expand the Yum! Global Data Hub, which captures the vast majority of global transaction-level sales data and other key operational and customer metrics. We believe this centralized hub is a key asset and differentiator for Yum! as we develop leading AI capabilities.\nIn 2024, our easy insights team will develop and test new AI-driven capabilities that pull from the global data hub and integrate into our own technology platforms. Some examples of these AI-driven capabilities include personalized upsell recommendations for customers ordering on our digital platforms, intelligent menu pricing recommendations and dynamic restaurant routines for restaurant general managers.\nFinally, we will begin activating our U.S. cross-brand customer data platform in Q4 and throughout 2024. This cross-brand platform gives us unprecedented visibility into the ordering behaviors of millions of customers across our four brands and will also be a breakthrough source of learnings for Collider, the high impact boutique insights consultancy that we acquired in 2015.\nLastly, I'll provide an update on our balance sheet and capital strategy. As a reminder, our capital priorities remain unchanged: Invest in the business for the long term, maintain a resilient balance sheet, pay a competitive dividend and maximize shareholder value by returning excess capital through debt paydown and share repurchases.\nNet capital expenditures for the quarter were $31 million, reflecting $57 million in gross CapEx and $26 million in refranchising proceeds. Our net leverage ratio ended the quarter at 4.4x. Furthermore, our current outstanding debt has a weighted average maturity of 6 years and our greater than 90% fixed debt ratio remains highly attractive in the current market environment.\nTo wrap up, we're very proud of the results in this quarter. We are on a clear path to achieving double-digit core operating profit growth for the full year. We continue to strengthen our position as the global franchisor of choice, a testament to the success of our business strategies and industry-leading talent. We're proud of our incredible continued momentum on unit development and are excited as we further accelerate our tech deployments and AI initiatives to meet the demands of consumers both today and tomorrow.\nWith that, operator, we are ready to take any questions."

Brands Earnings Conference Call. My name is Bruno, and I'll be the operator of today. [Operator Instructions]\nI would now like to hand over to your host, Jodi Dyer, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nJodi Dyer\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThanks, operator. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. On our call today are David Gibbs, our CEO; Chris Turner, our CFO; and Dave Russell, our Senior Vice President and Corporate Controller. Following remarks from David and Chris, we'll open the call to questions.\nBefore we get started, please note that this call includes forward-looking statements that are subject to future events and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. All forward-looking statements are made only as of the date of this call and should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statements in our earnings release and the risk factors included in our filings with the SEC.\nIn addition, please refer to our earnings release and relevant sections of our filings with the SEC to find disclosures, definitions and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures and other metrics used on today's call.\nPlease note that during today's call, all system sales growth and operating profit growth results exclude the impact of foreign currency. Please also note the following financial reporting treatment related to our exit from Russia. As a reminder, as of the beginning of the second quarter of 2022, we elected to remove the Russia business from key performance metrics. For the purpose of this call, all references to system sales growth and unit growth results for the quarter are adjusted to remove our Russia business from the prior year base. This negatively impacted both our worldwide unit growth and worldwide system sales growth by 2 percentage points. These units were removed from our same-store sales calculations and, thus, do not impact same-store sales results for the first quarter.\nAll GAAP figures reported continue to include the impacts of Russia operations for KFC for the full quarter. These GAAP figures primarily include royalty revenues from continued franchise operations and G&A to support our Russia business.\nAdditionally, our GAAP G&A includes expenses incurred relating to the transfer of ownership of the business. As a result of our decision to exit our Russia business, we have reclassed net operating profits from the operating segments in which they are earned subsequent to the start of the conflict to corporate and unallocated and reflected those net operating profits as a special item within the other income and expense line.\nAs a reminder, in April, we completed the exit of the Russia market by selling the KFC business in Russia to Smart Service Ltd., including all Russian KFC restaurants operating systems, master franchise rights and the trademark for the Rostik brand. Beginning in the second quarter, the Russia business will no longer be reported in our GAAP results, including franchise revenue and G&A.\nFor more information on our reporting calendar for each market, please visit the Financial Reports section of our website.\nWe are broadcasting this conference call via our website. This call is also being recorded and will be available for playback. Looking ahead, our second quarter earnings will be released on August 2, 2023, with the conference call on the same day.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to David Gibbs.\n\nDavid W. Gibbs\n\nPresident, Chief Financial Officer & Chief Operating Officer, Yum! Brands, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jodi, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter results provide further proof of the power of our portfolio of iconic brands. Both the diverse nature of our global footprint and the advantages of our business model enable us to thrive in any environment.\nOur incredible teams and franchise partners delivered another strong quarter with 13% system sales growth driven by 8% same-store sales growth and 5% unit growth. A strong set of commercial strategies that balance compelling value and craveable, distinctive products fueled our first quarter sales momentum.\nWe continue to execute on our digital strategy to create more seamless, personalized experiences to drive greater customer engagement and easier access to our brands. These efforts resulted in broad-based acceleration in digital sales growth, leading to a record quarter for both digital system sales of nearly $7 billion and a digital sales mix that exceeded 45%.\nImportantly, our core operating profit grew 11% in the first quarter, including a 1 point headwind from the removal of Russia profits, giving us great confidence in delivering on our long-term growth algorithm this year.\nBefore I discuss our first quarter results, I wanted to provide an update on Russia. In April, we announced the completion of our sale of the KFC Russia business to Smart Service Ltd., including all Russian KFC restaurants operating systems, master franchise rights and the trademark for the Rostik's brand. As part of the sale and purchase agreement, Smart Service has agreed to retain our company employees in Russia. With the completion of this transaction, we have ceased our corporate presence in Russia.\nNow I'll discuss our first quarter results through the lens of our Recipe for Good Growth framework. I'll begin by talking about our Relevant, Easy and Distinctive brands or R.E.D. for short, and our Unrivaled Culture & Talent. Chris will then share the details of our first quarter financial results before discussing our bold restaurant development and unmatched operating capabilities.\nFirst, let's discuss our iconic R.E.D. brands, beginning with the KFC Division, which represents 50% of our divisional operating profit. First quarter system sales grew 15%, driven by 9% same-store sales growth and 7% unit growth, reflecting broad-based strength. Globally, KFC is consistently executing its winning recipe of menu innovation, disruptive value, expanding category use occasions and doubling down on digital initiatives.\nWe were pleased to see strong year-over-year growth in our KFC China business. As usual, Joey Wat and her team did a great job navigating the complex operating environment as consumers became more mobile in the quarter and KFC was there to meet their needs.\nAdditionally, our International, ex China same-store sales, grew 11%, fueled by strong transaction and check growth. We attribute this exceptional performance to strong value offerings, the continued return of dine-in traffic, digital initiatives and strategic third-party partnerships. We've seen sustained momentum across many of our emerging markets, including Latin America and the Middle East. Additionally, we've seen renewed strength in many European markets where the team is promoting value at several price points to appeal to a broader customer base while innovating around our core menu offerings.\nThe focus at KFC U.S. is targeting new audiences and category use occasions by using relevant value and product innovation, as demonstrated with the introduction of boneless offerings, including the return of the DoubleDown sandwich and launch of 2 for $5 wraps in the first quarter and the national launch of the much-anticipated chicken nuggets early in the second quarter.\nMoving on to the Taco Bell Division, which represents 34% of our divisional operating profit. Before I get to results for the quarter, I want to highlight that Mark King was recently named the 2023 Restaurant Business Leader of the Year for the incredible progress Taco Bell has made, growing the brand while expanding unit economics and strengthening relationships with franchisees under his leadership. Seeing our world-class talent recognized more broadly across our industry gives all of us at Yum! great pride.\nTaco Bell first quarter system sales grew 12%, led by 8% same-store sales growth and 6% unit growth. These incredible results build on years of sustained top line strength as the team executes on its consistent growth formula, which leverages the combination of brand buzz with unparalleled value offerings, [ buzz ] occasions and digital initiatives.\nThis quarter, Taco Bell created customer buzz around craveable product offerings that included the Crispy Melt Taco and the Grilled Cheese Burrito while still providing everyday value through $2 Burritos on the Cravings Value Menu. Strong demand for the Grilled Cheese Burrito is a fantastic example that proves Taco Bell can win in the big burrito category and participate in higher price points while maintaining value leadership.\nTaco Bell U.S. is leaning into its digital initiatives to drive customer engagement, with year-over-year digital sales up approximately 60%, leading to an 8-point improvement in its digital mix.\nTaco Bell recently launched delivery-as-a-service through its mobile app to create easier access for our customers to get our craveable products. Additionally, the team also continues to make progress against our Recipe for Good Growth strategy with the ongoing condition of their packaging suite to more recycle-ready options.\nTaco Bell International grew system sales 25% in the quarter, driven by continued development momentum and strong value proposition through core menu innovation offerings.\nNext, I'll discuss the Pizza Hut Division, which accounts for 17% of our divisional operating profit. System sales grew 10% for the quarter, driven by 7% same-store sales growth and 3% unit growth. Same-store sales growth accelerated sequentially from the fourth quarter, driven by China and continued strength in the U.S.\nPizza Hut International, which accounts for 9% of our divisional operating profit, grew system sales 10%, led by 5% same-store sales growth and 5% unit growth.\nFollowing the successful launch of Melts in the U.S., the team launched this breakthrough product in 10 additional markets, including the U.K., Canada and several markets in Latin America. I'd like to recognize our global pizza team for their collaborative efforts to scale this winning innovation quickly. Our markets not only shared consumer insights and product innovation at unprecedented speed, but the operations team also used augmented reality to expedite training of our international team members through our intelligent coaching app.\nPizza Hut U.S., which represents 8% of our divisional operating profit, achieved 10% system sales growth with 8% same-store sales growth and flat unit growth. Melts, in combination with the Big New Yorker in the quarter, helped to drive positive transaction growth by attracting new and repeat customers. The team continues to expand strategic partnerships and is now integrated with the 3 major food aggregators in the U.S. We view aggregator marketplaces as an additional channel to provide customers greater access to our brand, while also attracting an incremental customer.\nThe Habit Burger Grill Division grew system sales 8% with 8% -- the Habit team continues to focus on expanding its abilities through mobile app user base and partnering with third-party aggregators.\nBefore moving on to our Unrivaled Culture & Talent, I want to take a moment to thank [ Russ Bendel ] and celebrate his accomplished career in the restaurant industry as he plans to retire next month. Russ' passion for restaurants has always shined through and anyone who knows Russ knows that what he really values above all else is people. Everyone is a friend to Russ, and he is loved by all who have had the privilege to work beside him, whether in a kitchen or an office.\nWe recently announced that Russ's successor is former KFC Global Division CFO, Shannon Hennessy. Shannon is an exceptional leader, and we're excited to have her drive the next chapter of growth for Habit and continue Russ' focus on people.\nMore broadly on our Unrivaled Culture & Talent growth driver, we've held powerful forums this year that galvanized our franchisees and top talent around our Recipe for Good Growth. In February, we hosted our 11th International Franchise Convention in Singapore, bringing together our global brand leadership teams and many of our 1,500 franchisees from around the world. Having attended this convention for many years, I've never seen this level of unity and enthusiasm for growth, particularly as it relates to development and broad strategic alignment with our franchise community. Our franchisees are some of the most growth-minded entrepreneurs in the world, and the international franchise convention was an opportunity to learn from, recognize and celebrate each other's achievements.\nOur partnership with our franchisees is as strong as it's ever been. We are strategically aligned to keep our iconic brands R.E.D. and our global growth momentum strong by leveraging the investments we've made in consumer insights, our digital ecosystem, innovative technologies and data analytics.\nAdditionally, we are focused on unlocking opportunities for our people and communities while promoting equity inclusion and belonging across all aspects of our business. We were proud that many of our leaders, including myself, participated in the Women's Foodservice Forum as we focus on elevating all voices and achieving gender parity globally by 2030.\nWe also announced the launch of Franchise Fast Start, the program funded by Lafayette Square to provide lending support to expand Yum! franchise ownership in underserved communities in the U.S.\nAs a result of our efforts, we've recently been named to Newsweek's America's Greatest Workplaces for Women and Forbes America's Best Employers for Diversity List.\nTo wrap up, I'm always thrilled to start the year with fantastic momentum, especially when the strength is broad-based across our global portfolio. I remain confident in our ability to navigate any economic environment as our brands stand for unmatched value and convenience, providing a range of products and price points to meet all customers' needs. We are poised to maintain our robust sales momentum given our pipeline of R.E.D. product innovation, accelerating digital sales, strengthening operational execution and compelling value across our global portfolio of iconic brands.\nWith that, Chris, over to you.\n\nChristopher Lee Turner\n\nCFO, Yum! Brands, Inc.\n\nThank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our financial results, our bold restaurant development and unmatched operating capability growth drivers followed by our capital strategy.\nI'll begin with our first quarter results, which reflects strong fundamental performance across all of our core financial metrics. We delivered 13% system sales growth driven by 8% same-store sales growth and 5% unit growth. Core operating profit growth for the quarter came in at 11%, which includes a 1 point headwind from the removal of Russia profits. Reported operating profit includes a $27 million negative impact from foreign currency translation. We expect foreign currency translation to be a $10 million to $20 million headwind to second quarter operating profit.\nOur digital sales accelerated across our 3 global brands, leading to a record quarter with nearly $7 billion in digital sales. We are confident our digital strategies are working, considering we reached a new high in our digital sales mix, exceeding 45% this quarter.\nTaco Bell store level margins were 22%, flat year-over-year, ex special, general and administrative expenses were $278 million, in line with our expectations. As we previously mentioned, we expect our year-over-year G&A growth will be higher in the first half of the year.\nThe ex special tax rate for the quarter was 19%. Our first quarter EPS, excluding special items, was $1.06, roughly flat over the prior year. First quarter EPS was negatively impacted by unrealized investment losses of $0.07 relating to our investment in Devyani and foreign currency translation impact of $0.08.\nAs David mentioned, we completed the sale of our Russia business last month. Beginning in the second quarter, the Russia business will no longer be reported in our GAAP results, including franchise revenue and G&A. For modeling purposes, KFC Russia's quarterly franchisee fee revenue and G&A have averaged approximately $20 million and $5 million, respectively, over the last few quarters.\nWe are pleased to see inflationary pressures, staffing challenges and supply chain disruptions abate in the U.S. as we return to a more normalized operating environment. While we've seen similar trends in some international markets, there are others where our franchisees continue to face outsized inflationary pressures. We continue to partner with our franchisees to protect restaurant-level profitability while ensuring we maintain strong relative value for our customers. We're encouraged by trends in commodity inflation and labor availability as both bode well for the health of our franchise system, which is the foundation of our industry-leading development engine.\nNow moving on to Bold Restaurant Development. we opened 746 gross new units during the quarter. Full year 2023 is shaping up to be another incredible year of development, similar to 2021 and 2022. But it's important to note the quarterly cadence of development will be weighted more heavily towards the second half of the year.\nAs we've said before, we have great line of sight into our development pipeline, with over 80% of 2023 planned units at KFC and Pizza Hut outside of China committed with well-capitalized road-ready franchise partners.\nLet me share a few highlights of our diverse development drivers, beginning with the KFC Division, which opened 385 gross units this quarter. China, India and our Latin America markets led the charge this quarter, with each opening more than 20 units. I'd like to recognize our KFC team in the Philippines for their efforts to drive our [ good growth solar ] panels to build more sustainable restaurants.\nAs for the Pizza Hut Division, the team opened 271 gross units this quarter, including the China, India and Turkey markets each opening more than 20 units. As we had anticipated, we exited our Pakistan Pizza Hut franchise partner and closed all 77 stores in the market. We are committed to partnering with capable, committed and well-capitalized franchisees. In some instances, the best thing for our brands and business in the long term is to exit a market and reopen with the right 3C franchise partner, which is exactly what we plan to do in this situation.\nTurning to Taco Bell. The team opened 79 gross units in Q1. The Taco Bell team continues to leverage unique store designs to enhance both the digital and drive-through experience for our customers.\nTaco Bell International is off to a record-breaking start, with 46 units opened this quarter, and Taco Bell China becoming our fourth international market to cross the 100-unit threshold, along with Spain, the U.K. and India. These top 4 markets accounted for 60% of new builds this quarter, illustrating the power and scale to drive accelerated growth.\nIn summary, we remain confident in our ability to maintain our industry-leading development momentum.\nNext, I'll discuss our unmatched operating capabilities and the 3 pillars of our digital strategy: Easy Experiences, Easy Operations and Easy Insights.\nFirst, our commitment as a franchise-first organization and unmatched operating capabilities are contributing to our position as the global franchisor of choice. We mentioned on our fourth quarter earnings call that Taco Bell was ranked #1 in Entrepreneur Magazine's Franchise 500 ranking in North America. Building on that recognition, this last week, Entrepreneur Magazine announced its [ 2023 top ] global [indiscernible] largest brands made the top 5, led by KFC in the #1 spot.\nMoving on to the pillars of our digital strategy. Beginning with the Easy Experiences pillar, we continued to enhance our digital ordering capabilities and launched new ordering channels. In fact, Tictuk completed its single largest market deployment for chat ordering to date this quarter.\nCustomers are now able to order KFC across 1,000 stores in South Africa using WhatsApp. Early results in the market show this new ordering channel is sticky, with more than 40% of users placing multiple orders in the first 90 days after launch.\nWithin the Easy Operations pillar, Dragontail launched in over 1,000 [ orders ] across KFC and Pizza Hut this quarter, led by the Pizza Hut U.S. system, which doubled its store count to reach approximately 1,000 restaurants in total. Additionally, KFC Canada launched nearly 400 restaurants on the platform.\nRestaurants that implement Dragontail consistently see improvements in product quality and customer satisfaction scores as the order sequencing algorithm and driver dispatch capabilities ensure customers' favorite Yum! products arrive hot and fresh.\nAdditionally, the first quarter marked an exciting collaboration milestone for our restaurant technology teams. The core platform that powers Hut [ but ], Pizza Huts Coach in your pocket application that supports over 20,000 Pizza Hut managers in 85 countries will now be managed centrally by Yum! digital and technology. This shift allows us to scale mobile-first technology for our restaurant managers more quickly across our brands and ensures continued product enhancement and future AI-based innovation under the Yum! Super App banner.\nFinally, for our Easy Insights pillar, we rolled out recommended ordering to nearly 600 additional stores and are live in over 3,600 stores in KFC and Taco Bell U.S. Recommended ordering is an AI module that recommends the quantity of product a restaurant manager should order each week. It reduces the time restaurant managers spend ordering product, improves forecast accuracy and reduces waste and time-consuming off-cycle orders and cross-store transfers. At Taco Bell, we have seen a 70% reduction in off-cycle orders and store transfers which frees up our managers to focus on delivering great guest experiences.\nLastly, I'll provide an update on our balance sheet and liquidity position. Our capital priorities remain unchanged: invest in the business, maintain a resilient balance sheet, offer a competitive dividend and continuously evaluate the optimal use of our excess cash. We constantly revisit the allocation of our capital to optimize shareholder returns.\nOur net leverage ratio ended the quarter at 4.9x. As a reminder, we expect our leverage ratio to drift modestly lower this year.\nOur net capital expenditures for the quarter were $57 million, reflecting $5 million in refranchising proceeds and $62 million in gross CapEx.\nAs it relates to our share buyback program, during the quarter, we repurchased approximately 400,000 shares at an average share price of $129 per share, totaling approximately $50 million.\nTo close, we're incredibly pleased with our results for the quarter. With a great start to the year, we're confident in delivering on our long-term growth algorithm in 2023. Our relevant and iconic brands consistently demonstrate that they are uniquely positioned to thrive in any macro environment and create lasting shareholder value.\nWith that, operator, we are ready to take any questions."

Brands, Inc. 2022 Third Quarter Earnings Call. My name is Drew, and I'll be coordinating your call today. (Operator Instructions)\nI'm now going to hand over to Gavin Felder, Chief Strategy Officer and Interim Head of Investor Relations, to begin. Please go ahead.\n\nGavin Felder\n\nChief Strategy Officer, Yum! Brands, Inc.\n\nThanks, operator. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. As a reminder, I will be covering for Jodi Dyer while she is out on maternity leave.\nOn our call today are David Gibbs, our CEO; Chris Turner, our CFO; and Dave Russell, our Senior Vice President and Corporate Controller. Following remarks from David and Chris, we'll open the call to questions.\nBefore we get started, I would like to remind you that this conference call includes forward-looking statements that are subject to future events and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. All forward-looking statements are made only as of the date of this announcement and should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statements in our earnings release and the risk factors included in our filings with the SEC.\nIn addition, please refer to our earnings releases and relevant sections of our filings with the SEC to find disclosures and definitions of non-GAAP financial measures and other metrics that may be used on today's call as well as reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures. Please note that during today's call, all system sales growth and operating profit growth results exclude the impact of foreign currency.\nNext, I'll provide an update on the financial reporting treatment related to our exit from Russia. As a reminder, as of the beginning of the second quarter, we elected to remove the Russia business from key performance metrics. This negatively impacted our third quarter unit growth by 2 percentage points and our system sales growth by 3 percentage points.\nAdditionally, these units were removed from our same-store sales calculations and thus do not impact same-store sales results for the third quarter. For the purposes of this call, all references to system sales growth and unit growth results for the quarter are adjusted to remove our Russia business from the prior year base.\nWe continue to include Russia in GAAP measures for KFC, including royalty revenue and expenses to support the Russia business and expenses incurred relating to the transfer of ownership of the business. As a result of our decision to exit our Russia business, we have reclassed net operating profits from the operating segments subsequent to the start of the conflict to corporate and unallocated and reflected as a special item within the other income and expense line.\nFor more information on our reporting calendar for each market, please visit the Financial Reports section of our website. We are broadcasting this conference call via our website. This call is also being recorded and will be available for playback. Please be advised that if you ask a question, it will be included in both our live conference and in any future use of the recording.\nWe would like to make you aware of upcoming Yum! investor events and the following. Disclosures pertaining to outstanding debt in our restricted group capital structure will be provided at the time of our Form 10-Q filing. We will be hosting an Investor Day in person on Tuesday, December 13, 2022, at the New York Stock Exchange. The event will also be webcast via our website at investors.yum.com. Fourth quarter earnings will be released on February 8, 2023, with the conference call on the same day.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to David Gibbs.\n\nDavid W. Gibbs\n\nCEO & Director, Yum! Brands, Inc.\n\nThank you, Gavin, and good morning, everyone. Our strong top line momentum this quarter highlights clear demand for our iconic brands. We delivered 10% system sales growth underpinned by 5% same-store sales growth and 6% unit growth.\nWhile the broader macro environment evolves, our brands continue to thrive by being distinctive, creating excitement for consumers and by delivering exceptional value and convenience. The investments we have made in areas such as consumer insights, marketing analytics and new technology platforms allow us to act with pace and confidence to meet the needs of consumers around the world.\nI'm particularly thrilled about the performance of the KFC and Taco Bell division that were both standout performers this quarter. KFC did an excellent job in driving transaction growth through its omnichannel approach, leading to a sequential improvement in comps from the prior quarter. Taco Bell is winning, thanks to its ability to generate and amplify standout moments in culture and translate the resulting top line growth into impressive restaurant-level margins.\nI'm also excited to share that we opened a total of 979 gross units across 74 countries, proof that our development engine is powerful and diversified. As these results show, our committed and well-capitalized franchise partners are seizing opportunities to invest in the growth of our brands for the long term.\nNext, I want to provide an update on our Russian business. As Gavin mentioned, we have a signed purchase agreement to transfer ownership of our Russian KFC restaurants, operating system and master franchise rights to an existing KFC Russia franchisee. Following the completion of the transaction, we will have ceased our corporate presence in Russia.\nI want to say that I'm incredibly proud of how our local teams have managed through this extremely difficult time and prioritized the safety of our people in the region. Our #1 priority is our people, and they will always be at the center of every decision we make.\nNow I'll talk about 2 of our growth drivers, our Relevant, Easy and Distinctive Brands, or R.E.D. for short, and our unrivaled culture and talent. Then I'll provide an update on our Recipe for Good. Chris will share the details of our third quarter financial results before discussing our Bold Restaurant Development and unmatched operating capabilities growth drivers.\nFirst, I'll discuss our R.E.D. brands. Beginning with the KFC division, which accounts for 51% of our operating cost. System sales grew 12%, underpinned by 7% same-store sales growth and 7% unit growth. As these results prove, this business can perform well in a multitude of environments, even as certain pockets of the global portfolio experience heightened macro pressures.\nAt KFC's International business, which represents 46% of our operating profit, our system sales grew 14%, driven by an 8% increase in same-store sales. This represents a significant acceleration from the 1% same-store sales growth in the second quarter.\nWe saw notable strength in the Middle East, India and Africa, thanks to momentum across our digital channels and a focus on operations and value. Our Middle East market is truly on fire, where system sales grew an impressive 46% with strength across all channels, including a ramp-up in the use of kiosks and Click and Collect.\nOur India market saw system sales grow 45% during the quarter, with customers enjoying the convenience-driven 7-minute Express takeaway guarantee. In Africa, where system sales grew 31%, the team is focused on providing an easy and convenient digital experience for consumers. They've done an outstanding job rebranding their Click and Collect channel as well as rolling out kiosks across the market to drive sales, underpinned by compelling sharing offers like the All In One Feast.\nAt KFC U.S., we brought back our famous $5 Mac & Cheese Bowls as a value-oriented item this quarter. The reboot of this much-loved product helps drive a positive 2% same-store sales comp. Additionally, for a limited time, we launched a $6 2-piece drum and thigh combo, which has driven positive results in a meaningful, sequential improvement in transactions.\nMoving on to our Taco Bell division, which represents 34% of our operating profit. We saw extremely strong momentum with system sales growing 9%, led by 6% same-store sales growth and 5% unit growth.\nAt Taco Bell U.S., system sales grew 8% for the quarter, underpinned by a 7% same-store sales growth and 2% unit growth. The brand is bringing to life its one-of-a-kind menu through creative innovation in a way that only Taco Bell can. This was most evident with the team adding products to its $2 cravings menu such as the Cheesy Double Beef Burrito, while innovating with premium offers like the Grilled Cheese Burrito.\nTaco Bell is a brand that is truly relevant, easy and distinctive with a unique ability to stand for value in the current economic environment, yet have a broad enough range to appeal to consumers across every demographic. As we enter the fourth quarter, we're even more excited about the momentum in Taco Bell U.S. with the relaunch of the Mexican Pizza, which occurred in mid-September.\nAt Taco Bell International, system sales grew 26%, driven by 30% unit growth and 5% same-store sales growth. In the third quarter, 5 markets delivered double-digit system sales growth, marking another milestone in Taco Bell's international expansion journey. Year-to-date, we've opened 111 net new units, almost double the number opened at this point last year. We're driving scale in key markets, helping our franchisees leverage their size to optimize marketing spend, expand development capabilities and gain local sourcing efficiencies.\nNext, at the Pizza Hut division, which accounts for 15% of our operating profit. Our system sales grew 5%, led by 5% unit growth and 1% same-store sales growth. At Pizza Hut International, which accounts for 8% of our operating profit, system sales grew 6%, underpinned by 8% unit growth and 2% same-store sales growth.\nAcross our markets, we are focused on finding ways to expand our reach to become a more everyday brand. For example, as a leading everyday value offering, the Pizza Hut India team launched a Fun Flavor pizza costing roughly $1.\nMore broadly, the My Box value platform is proving to be a key traffic driver through innovation and giving customers the option to customize with new entrees and side items. The platform helps us lean in on the individual meal and lunch occasions, and it's now live in over 50 countries. I'm also pleased to say that our emerging markets are seeing a recovery in traffic and demand as we lap the impact of COVID.\nPizza Hut U.S., which accounts for 7% of our operating profit, saw system sales grow 2%, driven by 1% same-store sales growth. A key focus for this business has been to provide our customers with the ability to access our brands wherever they are. As part of this initiative, we continue to partner with third-party aggregators and integrate them into our POS systems, with 90% of our system using at least one third-party marketplace.\nIn addition, we are working to ensure we have the right value offerings to meet consumer demand and maintain franchisee profitability. This effort led to the introduction of items such as the $6.99 medium 1-topping pairs deal and the return of the Big Dinner Box as an abundant family value offering.\nLastly at The Habit Burger Grill. Same-store sales trends on a 3-year basis have sequentially improved since the second quarter. Additionally, we continued to see consumers download our mobile app, leading to a 10% increase in app downloads since last quarter. Digital sales at The Habit now account for 33% of mix. The team is making good progress growing new sales channels and forming direct relationships with our customers.\nMoving on to our unrivaled culture and talent growth driver. As we've mentioned on previous calls, we have been celebrating our 25th anniversary as a publicly-traded company in various forms throughout this year. I'd like to acknowledge the important role our unique people-first culture and world-class talent have played in our success over the last 25 years.\nOur culture, which is focused on recognition and collaboration, is a key differentiator across our portfolio of iconic brands. It continues to drive retention and recruitment of amazing leaders who are developing others, growing their careers and ensuring the continued strong performance and success of our brand. I'm proud of Yum!'s deep bench of outstanding leaders and how our commitment to growing our people from within has driven a healthy increase in promotions and new opportunities for our teams. Our culture continues to attract top external talents as well. We recently welcomed former Mars Inc. executive, Allyson Park, to our global leadership team as Yum!'s Chief Corporate Affairs Officer, overseeing communications and public policy as well as our ESG strategy, an area of increased importance as we continue driving our Recipe for Good.\nAt Pizza Hut, we welcomed former Starbucks executive Shannon Garcia as the brand's Global Chief Operating and Transformation Officer, a role that will evolve the way in which the brand works with its markets to add value and operate with a digital-first mindset. These are just 2 examples of the incredible talent that our culture enables us to attract from outside and within our industry.\nWhen it comes to our Recipe for Good, we continue to invest in critical work that's focused on our 3 priority areas of people, food and planet. I'm proud of our commitment and the progress we're making on the execution of our ESG agenda.\nFor example, when it comes to our climate efforts, we moved Yum!'s U.S. offices as well as all of our company-owned restaurants to renewable electricity. We're now conducting a global study on renewable energy markets to identify low-carbon solutions at our restaurants worldwide.\nAnd in August, Pizza Hut U.S. announced an exciting partnership with Dairy Farmers of America on an innovative farm-level sustainability project to provide participating farmers with the technology and data needed to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. With iconic brands and unmatched scale, I truly believe that we're in a unique position to make a significant impact in the areas we are prioritizing.\nTo wrap up, I'm excited about the momentum in the business that we demonstrated this quarter. The power and resilience of our brands was clear as we continue to prove we can perform well in any environment. With our diversified global scale, world-class franchise partners and unmatched operating capabilities, I am more confident than ever in the future success of our business.\nWith that, Chris, over to you.\n\nChristopher Lee Turner\n\nCFO, Yum! Brands, Inc.\n\nThank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our financial results, our Bold Restaurant Development and Unmatched Operating Capability growth drivers, followed by our capital strategy.\nI'll begin with our third quarter financial results. System sales grew 10%, with broad-based strength evident across our portfolio. Same-store sales grew 5% while units grew 6%. Core operating profit grew 8%, which includes a 3 point headwind from the removal of Russia profits this year. Ex special, general and administrative expenses came in at $259 million, tracking in line with our expectations for $1.1 billion of G&A expense for fiscal 2022.\nImpressively, our Taco Bell store-level margins were 24%, trending above third quarter last year and above pre-COVID levels. With respect to reported operating profit, FX had a negative $39 million impact and we now expect a full year FX headwind of approximately $100 million.\nThird quarter EPS, excluding special items, was $1.09, an 11% decrease versus the prior year. In addition to a 3 percentage point impact from forgone operating profits in Russia, EPS growth was also negatively impacted by 9 percentage points from the aforementioned FX, 9 percentage points owing to a higher tax rate and 6 percentage points from lower year-over-year unrealized gain associated with our investment in Devyani.\nOur ex special tax rate this quarter was higher than usual at just under 27%, largely due to adjustments recorded in the quarter associated with prior year taxes. Given these adjustments, we now expect our full year tax rate to land between 23% and 24%.\nOverall, given the same strength of our global business, we continue to expect to grow core operating profit in the mid-single-digit range for the full year. As we mentioned on the past 2 quarterly calls, were it not for the loss of Russian profits, we would expect core operating profit growth to be high single digits this year, in line with our long-term growth outlook.\nNow let me share some more detail on unit growth and our Bold Restaurant Development growth driver. This quarter, we opened 979 gross new units with encouraging momentum across our brand portfolio. At KFC, we opened 485 gross new units with China, India, the Middle East and Thailand leading the charge. Our Pizza Hut International division saw incredible development progress this quarter, opening 344 gross new units, setting a third quarter development record. This puts Pizza Hut International's year-to-date gross openings at 879 units, which is 280 units ahead of this time last year. China, India and Turkey led Pizza Hut development, with each market adding more than 30 gross new units.\nThe Taco Bell division opened 98 gross new units this quarter, led by strong international development, achieving a Q3 record of over 50 gross new units. For Taco Bell International, I'm excited to share that this quarter, both the India and U.K. markets, joined Spain in the ranks of countries that now exceed 100 units.\nWhile Taco Bell U.S. development remains robust, we expect international development to lead Taco Bell's unit growth this year.\nDespite the uneven macro pressures across our markets, our development remains strong as our franchisees use market disruptions as opportunities to grow. We are partnering closely with our franchisees to navigate challenges in the supply chain and higher construction costs. We are leveraging both our sourcing expertise and scale to secure equipment and realize favorable pricing on key items. Our teams are highly focused on balancing long-term profitability for our franchisees and offering value for our customers. With the power of our well-capitalized and committed franchise system and the unique global scale we have at Yum!, we remain confident in our ability to grow in any economic environment.\nNext, I'll discuss our unmatched operating capabilities and the 3 pillars of our digital strategy: Easy Experiences, Easy Operations and Easy Insights. I'll start with an update on our Easy Experiences pillar, which focuses on delivering exceptional customer experiences through technology and dedicated operational programs.\nQSR magazine ranked Taco Bell and KFC in the top 3 for fastest drive-thru times in the U.S. In fact, Taco Bell drive-thru times were 9 seconds faster year-over-year.\nKFC division kiosk sales also stood out this quarter with a more than 40% increase in sales year-over-year and 6% system sales mix, an impressive result considering that only 15% of KFC restaurants currently have kiosks.\nWe are also encouraged that the Tictuk platform is expanding beyond chat ordering with its e-commerce engine, with a front- and back-end website and mobile app that is serving some of our smaller international countries. We recently went live with Tictuk's e-commerce engine in KFC Mexico and saw an increase in conversion rates post launch. We expect Tictuk's e-commerce engine will be live in 18 countries by year-end.\nMoving on to our Easy Operations pillar that centers on the team member and franchise partner experience. We completed the integration of our second delivery aggregator into the Pizza Hut U.S. system this quarter, building on our initiative to partner with third-party aggregators and provide our customers with more options to access our brands.\nFurther adoption of third-party aggregators for delivery as a service has also helped ensure that we can meet customer expectations during peak delivery hours and save valuable time for our team members, who can then spend more time elevating the customer experience.\nAdditionally, the global rollout of Dragontail's smart kitchen management and driver tracking system continues to progress at an impressive rate.\nLastly, I'll cover our Easy Insights pillar, which leverages the power of data and analytics to allow our teams to make smarter decisions. Kvantum, the marketing analytics company we acquired last year, continues to roll out to markets around the world. We are now leveraging Kvantum's media optimization platform across nearly 60 brand-country combinations, covering more than 60% of our system sales. Notably, Pizza Hut Australia has seen a double-digit increase in return on media spend after deploying Kvantum's advanced media mix analytics platform. Our brand teams are also using Kvantum's expanded suite of tools in areas such as customer analytics, pricing optimization and market intelligence.\nNext, I'll provide an update on our balance sheet and liquidity position. Our net leverage ratio ended the quarter at 5x despite the exclusion of our Russia business. Though capital markets continue to adjust to higher interest rates, we are proud of the work our treasury team has done to put us in the enviable position of having no significant maturities over the next 3 years and approximately 94% of our debt fixed.\nAs we've said before, our capital priorities remain consistent: invest in the business, maintain a healthy balance sheet, pay a competitive dividend and returning the remaining excess cash to shareholders via share repurchases.\nOur capital expenditures for the quarter, net of refranchising proceeds, were $51 million. Our full year expectation for net capital expenditures is now approximately $200 million, reflecting $50 million in refranchising proceeds and roughly $250 million in gross CapEx.\nWith regard to our share buyback program, we repurchased 1.4 million shares in the quarter at an average share price of $116 per share, totaling approximately $157 million.\nAdditionally, during September, the Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase authorization of up to $2 billion through June 30, 2024, that will take effect upon exhaustion of the current authorization.\nTo close, I'm excited about the continued growth we saw this quarter and the momentum in our diversified development across the portfolio. This once again shows that our iconic brands and world-class franchise partners are well positioned to navigate any economic environment.\nBefore wrapping up, I'd like to remind everyone that our Investor Day is taking place in person at the New York Stock Exchange on December 13. We look forward to seeing you then.\nWith that, operator, we are ready to take any questions."

Brands as we cross the $60 billion system sales threshold and exceeded all [indiscernible] of our long-term growth algorithm. Despite facing numerous challenges around the world, our incredible teams delivered another exceptional year of growth across our business.\nWe set an industry development record for the third straight year. We made massive strides in scaling our proprietary digital and AI-driven ecosystem, and we continue to build a talent base that I believe is the best in the industry.\nWe delivered 6% unit growth, 10% system sales growth and 12% core operating profit growth. We enter 2024 having opened just shy of 10,000 net new restaurants over the past 3 years and are well on our way to reaching 60,000 restaurants this year. This growth would not be possible were not for our world-class franchise partners, who continue to deploy their own capital based on their confidence to invest behind the long-term potential of our brand.\nAlong with the record-breaking success we've had on development, our digital strategy has helped propel top line results and improve bottom line profits. Digital sales approached $30 billion in 2023, up 22% year-over-year with mix now exceeding 45%.\nAt the same time, we have accelerated the deployment of our proprietary technologies to optimize back-of-house operations and make it easier to run our restaurants. In doing so, we are equipping our franchise partners with distinctive capabilities that differentiate them from the competition, especially in emerging markets.\nI'll now share some more details on the fourth quarter specifically. During the quarter, top line sales were impacted by the conflict in the Middle East region, with varying degrees of impact across markets in the Middle East, Malaysia and Indonesia. This represented a low single-digit headwind to Yum!'s overall fourth quarter same-store sales growth. This trend has continued into the first quarter, and we expect the sales impact to decrease over the course of 2024.\nKey to our growth is the performance of our twin growth engines, KFC International and Taco Bell U.S., which account for approximately 70% of Yum! system sales and roughly 80% of Yum!'s division operating profit. In 2023, KFC International opened nearly 2,700 new restaurants, reaching 10% growth with restaurants opened across 96 countries. More than 80% of unit growth came from our 15 publicly traded franchisees. Entering 2024, I have strong confidence in the durability of KFC's global expansion for which we continue to see an incremental 50,000 restaurant opportunity over the long term.\nOn a global basis, Taco Bell crossed the $15 billion system sales milestone this year, reflecting the growing scale of this powerhouse brand. Turning to Taco Bell U.S., which contributes more than 75% of our U.S. divisional operating profit, the brand maintained its 2-year same-store sales trend in the fourth quarter, outperforming the QSR industry. Taco Bell continued to deliver industry-leading margins at 24% this year while at the same time, leading the QSR industry in several key value perception indicators.\nNow I'll discuss our Relevant, Easy and Distinctive Brands or R.E.D. for short, followed by our Unrivaled Culture and Talent and good growth strategy. Chris will then provide an update on our fourth quarter results and balance sheet position, followed by our Bold Restaurant Development and Unmatched Operating Capability.\nStarting with the KFC division, which accounts for 50% of our divisional operating profit and will soon cross the incredible milestone of 30,000 units. For the year, system sales grew 12% with 8% unit growth and 7% same-store sales growth.\nFor the quarter, KFC achieved 7% system sales growth [indiscernible] to 8% unit growth and 2% same-store sales growth. Sales trends decelerated during the quarter in several markets as a result of the conflict in the Middle East.\nKFC China grew system sales by an impressive 20% during the quarter. We had several other standout markets this quarter, including 16% system sales growth in Latin America and 13% system sales growth in both Africa and Thailand.\nIn Latin America, we targeted new consumers and dayparts using compelling value offers, and we expanded our KFC original nugget. In Africa, the team boosted its breakfast daypart with new beverages, including signature coffees at a great price.\nThe Thailand market saw strong transaction growth driven by smart value offering across all dayparts. At KFC U.S., same-store sales were flat this quarter with trends on a 2-year basis remaining consistent from the prior quarter.\nIn Q1, the team has planned a range of exciting initiatives, including the smash potato bowl, the first bowl innovation since 2019, and the rollout of KFC's first loyalty rewards program.\nMoving on to Taco Bell division, which represents 36% of our divisional operating profit. At Taco Bell U.S., fourth quarter same-store sales grew 3% and 15% on a 2-year basis, outperforming the QSR industry by 3 points.\nTaco Bell U.S. faced tough laps early in the quarter but finished the year strong with comps up over 5% in the final period. The quarter included a record digital sales mix, which reached 31%, up 7 points year-over-year.\nGrowth in kiosk sales was a large driver with in-store kiosk sales mix increasing 15 points from Q4 last year. Optimizing our digital channels is also contributing to growth in Taco Bell's loyalty program with active loyalty users growing 17% in 2023.\nThe team plans to bring exciting enhancements to the loyalty program in the second half of 2024 to capitalize on digital engagement and provide an easier experience for customers to earn and redeem points. While not surprising, I'm always proud to see our incredible Taco Bell team's efforts being recognized with Entrepreneur Magazine naming the brand the #1 franchisor for the fourth year running and with Nation Restaurant News crowning Taco Bell the 2023 brand icon.\nWith an unprecedented range of exciting innovations launching this year, including at least one new product every 5 weeks, twice the rate of 2023, I'm confident Taco Bell will remain a brand icon for years to come.\nAt Taco Bell International, we delivered 14% unit growth this year. The majority of this growth was contributed by our big 4 scaled markets, including Spain, which opened 19 new units this year and is on track to reach 150 units in Q1.\nAs we enter 2024, we will work with our franchise partners in these markets to build brand and category awareness with Mexican food, particularly in Europe and Asia, leading into fan favorites and expanding offerings. Additionally, we are working on scaling and entering new markets that will enable a broader base from which to grow.\nNext, at the Pizza Hut division, which comprises 15% of our divisional operating profit and will soon eclipse 20,000 units. In Q4, system sales grew 1% with 4% unit growth and a 2% decline in same-store sales. Sales trends decelerated during the quarter in several markets as a result of the conflict in the Middle East. For the full year, system sales grew 5%, including 4% unit growth and 2% same-store sales growth.\nAt Pizza Hut International, same-store sales were flat for the quarter. The team continues to roll out Melts across the globe to build the individual eater occasion. Strength in the aggregator channel continues to be a bright spot across several markets, including Canada and Latin America.\nBuy One, Get One deals coupled with aggregator promotions drove transaction growth in Canada during the quarter. In Latin America, the promotion of our own digital channels in Brazil combined with the New York-style pizza helped boost sales for that market.\nAt Pizza Hut U.S., same-store sales declined 4% for the quarter while growing 1% for the full year. The Melts launch and the promotion of the Detroit-style pizza in the prior year contributed to a difficult lap this quarter.\nPizza Hut U.S. will face another challenging lap in Q1 as same-store sales increased 8% last year, reflecting full quarter of sales from the Melts platform and the Big New Yorker. However, we expect performance trends on a 2-year basis to improve in the first quarter.\nIn Q1, the team will launch 2 limited-time offers, including hot honey pizza and wings, a perfect pairing for fans to enjoy in the run-up to the Super Bowl. In the months ahead, the team will be announcing some exciting innovations to the Melts platform.\nLastly, at the Habit Burger Grill for the full year, system sales grew 6% led by 8% unit growth. Reflecting on 2023, Habit's new leadership team focused on improving all elements of Habit's operations, including expediting a robust kiosk rollout, implementing a sales-driven labor optimization model and harnessing Yum!'s co-op purchasing group to lower procurement costs and rationalize SKUs. As a result of these efforts, the team achieved a 380 basis point increase in full year store level margins despite softness in sales.\nNow I'll turn to our good growth strategy, starting with our people pillar. We take great pride in developing our talent and ensuring we have a strong bench to drive performance. And we were thrilled to be recognized in Time Magazine's inaugural list of the Best Companies for Future Leaders with Yum! ranking an impressive 32nd among U.S. companies.\nThe strength of our talent is evident through Sean Tresvant's official transition to Taco Bell division CEO on January 1. Sean joined Yum! in 2022 and is a visionary business leader with a proven track record of driving transformative brand building through his previous role as the Taco Bell Global Chief Brand and Strategy Officer. I'd like to again congratulate Sean as he takes the helm at Taco Bell. And I'm confident he and the rest of the team will continue to successfully deliver the brand's long-term global growth strategy.\nI'd also be remiss if we didn't take another opportunity to recognize Mark King for everything he did as Taco Bell division CEO to set the brand up for future success, including handpicking Sean as his successor and ensuring that Taco Bell would be in more than capable hand. On behalf of the entire Yum! system, I want to thank Mark for his people-first leadership that drove strong results, inspired restless creativity and solidified Taco Bell's unique brand identity that makes it an undisputed global icon.\nAdditionally, Pizza Hut Global Chief Technology Officer, Joe Park, will be moving into the Yum! Chief Digital and Technology Officer role currently held by Clay Johnson, who will continue as a senior adviser. I want to thank Clay for his incredible leadership joining Yum! in 2019, including developing our digital and technology capabilities from the ground up and establishing Yum! as a clear leader in technology in global QSR.\nSince joining Yum!, Joe formed our first-ever long-range innovation team before moving on to Pizza Hut, our most digital brand, where he partnered with our global operations and technology leaders to deliver new levels of ease to our customers and improved unit economics for our franchisees. I'm confident he is the perfect person to lead us into the next chapter on our digital and technology journey.\nMoving on to the planet pillar of our good growth strategy. In 2023, we remain focused on efforts under our priority areas of greenhouse gas reduction and sustainable packaging. We've made progress on our goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions nearly 50% by 2030 through investments in renewable energy and energy efficiencies in our restaurants and through ongoing commitments with our food suppliers.\nIn terms of packaging, we are increasing our global use of more widely recyclable plastics in our consumer packaging. And we continue to remove plastic packaging in the form of bags and cutlery in addition to eliminating styrofoam.\nOur continued progress in sustainability has been underscored by several recent recognition, including being named to the 2024 Dow Jones Sustainability Index North America for the eighth consecutive year and being listed by Newsweek as one of America's Most Responsible Companies for 2024.\nBefore I wrap, I want to pay tribute to our incredible partners, Yum China. In December, my team and I traveled to Shanghai to meet with CEO, Joey Wat, and her executive team. That trip reinforced our view that Yum China is without question the world's most capable restaurant operator. They enable rapid growth and structural cost efficiencies through their dynamic development capabilities and their robust in-house supply chain.\nOur team sampled amazing new menu items in their innovation kitchen. We saw firsthand the digital capabilities that enable Yum China to engage with an astounding 470 million members in its loyalty program. These advantages enable consistent paybacks of 2 to 3 years in KFC and Pizza Hut despite evolving market conditions, further testament to their clear competitive advantages in the market.\nAs I look back over the last year, the unique advantages of our diversified system shone through. While the business takes persistent inflation across the globe and navigated shifts in consumer sentiment coming from regional conflicts, we responded with a focused determination to execute our growth plan, including growing units in 110 countries, meaningfully scaling our technology systems, deepening collaboration across our brands and delivering both sales and profits well above our long-term growth algorithm.\nWe're confident 2024 will be another banner year with a number of exciting sales-driving opportunities such as enhancing the range of protein offerings at Taco Bell, expanding new category entry points and significantly boosting the impact of our loyalty program. With a world-class team, globally iconic brands, industry-leading franchisees and a relentless appetite for growth, the future is brighter than ever. And I am confident that we will continue to maximize value for our shareholders.\nWith that, Chris, over to you.\n\nChristopher Lee Turner\n\nCFO, Yum! Brands, Inc.\n\nThank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our financial results, our Bold Restaurant Development and Unmatched Operating Capability growth drivers, followed by an update on our balance sheet and capital strategy.\nAs David mentioned, 2023 was an exceptional year with Yum! exceeding all components of our long-term growth algorithm. Full year same-store sales grew a very robust 6%. We opened 4,754 gross new units, equivalent of 13 restaurants a day or one restaurant roughly every 2 hours. KFC set a brand development record opening over 2,700 new units, 97 different countries.\nI also want to extend congratulations to the Yum China team, who crossed 10,000 KFC restaurants this quarter with nearly 40% of those restaurants built in the last 3 years.\nTurning to our results. Full year system sales grew 10% with fourth quarter system sales up 5%, led by 6% unit growth and 1% same-store sales growth. Yum!'s twin growth engines, KFC International and Taco Bell U.S., grew system sales 12% this year.\nFourth quarter ex special general and administrative expenses were $344 million, down 4% year-over-year due to strict cost control. Reported G&A was $353 million for the quarter, including $9 million in special expense related to an ongoing resource optimization project. For the full year, ex special general and administrative expenses were $1.17 billion.\nCore operating profit grew 8% for the quarter and 12% for the full year. Reported operating profit includes a negligible impact in the quarter from foreign currency translation and a $49 million headwind for the full year. Our ex special tax rate was 26% in the quarter and slightly under 21% for the full year.\nFourth quarter ex special EPS was $1.26, a decline year-over-year, stemming from a $0.23 headwind from [indiscernible] in our quarterly tax rate that drove our effective tax rate above our guided range in 2023 and below our guided range in 2022. Full year ex special EPS was $5.17, a 14% increase year-over-year.\nNow let me share some greater detail on our fourth quarter unit growth in the context of our Bold Restaurant Development growth driver. Yum! opened just shy of 1,900 units in the fourth quarter with approximately 87% of that growth coming from our international markets. The KFC division was the largest driver, finishing the year with units up 8%. China, India, Thailand, South Africa and Spain drove KFC's development this year and were part of a group of 15 countries that grew unit count by more than 25 restaurants.\nIn December, we were pleased to announce that we signed an agreement to acquire 218 KFC restaurants from our largest franchisee in the U.K. This is an exciting opportunity for us to purchase restaurants with average unit volumes above $2 million and healthy store level cash margins in a market where we have an exceptional local management team who run our existing KFC U.K. equity store base.\nWe expect the addition of these units to provide approximately $40 million of incremental EBITDA in the 12 months after acquisition, while the benefit to our operating profit will be largely offset over the next several years due to depreciation and amortization, including amortization of reacquired franchise rights, which will be reflected in store level margins post acquisition. We anticipate this transaction to close during the second quarter.\nAt Pizza Hut, the division opened 575 units for the quarter and nearly 1,600 units for the year, a record for the brand. There were 73 markets that contributed to the brand's development. China, India, Turkey, Japan and Canada led Pizza Hut's growth internationally with more than 900 units opened across those countries.\nThe Taco Bell division opened 201 units in Q4 and 417 units for the full year. In the U.S., unit development was also on fire with 244 gross new units.\nOur longer-term growth engines that include Habit and Taco Bell International opened 208 units on a combined basis and grew unit count by 12%. We finished 2023 with unit growth occurring in 110 countries. We now have units in 293 brand country combinations, providing an unmatched level of diversity geographically as well as in consumer preference with lean brands in the chicken, pizza and Mexican categories. Looking ahead, we expect development in 2024 to continue at a robust pace.\nIn the first half, KFC will reach an incredible 30,000 units, and Pizza Hut will top 20,000 units. At KFC, we entered 2024 with more development commitments than last year. We recently returned from an inspiring visit to China in December, and we're reminded of the incredible runway for KFC's growth in the market, where Yum China has over 10,000 KFC restaurants yet served only 1/3 of the population.\nTaco Bell International will continue to expand their footprint, though the growth rate will temporarily slow as the brand looks to stabilize same-store sales performance in emerging markets and partner with franchisees to optimize site selection, leveraging KFC and Pizza Hut market-mapping data.\nMoving on to our Unmatched Operating Capabilities growth driver, which I'll speak to through the lens of our digital strategy, involving our Easy Experiences, Easy Operations and Easy Insights pillars. 2023 was a landmark year for successfully scaling our suite of proprietary technologies across our global restaurant base.\nBeginning with our Easy Experiences pillar, we have successfully deployed our Yum! Commerce Platform to KFC U.S. and Taco Bell U.S. and are continuing to onboard the Pizza Hut U.S. system. Looking ahead, we will start to deploy this platform to 2 Pizza Hut International markets in the first half of 2024.\nKiosks remain an important priority in delivering a consistent customer experience, driving ticket uplift and streamlining our restaurant operations. Globally, we've increased our kiosk penetration in KFC restaurants by 70% over the past year outside of China. We ended the year with kiosks in approximately 500 KFC U.S. restaurants, a huge step-up from nearly 0 only 2 quarters before. Our KFC Latin America markets also began the rollout of kiosks using our proprietary TikTok platform this year and plan to triple the restaurant count in 2024.\nWithin Easy Operations, this quarter, we continued to fire on all cylinders, significantly expanding the rollout of our world-class technology products and platforms. Poseidon, our proprietary point-of-sale system, which was expanded to an additional 1,700 Taco Bell U.S. restaurants, resulting in 5,000 restaurants having been onboarded this year.\nWe also ramped up the deployment of our Dragontail AI platform with an additional 1,000 locations onboarded this quarter and over 4,000 new restaurants added for the full year. We now have Dragontail in place in nearly 7,000 restaurants across Pizza Hut and KFC.\nOur 2024 rollout will include launching Dragontail in nearly 6,000 more restaurants, further evidence of our ability to scale software globally at a rapid pace. Our AI-driven automated inventory management system is now being used in 90% of our KFC U.S. locations and roughly half of our Taco Bell U.S. restaurants, driving more seamless and more accurate inventory ordering processes for our restaurant managers. More than 3,000 additional restaurants across KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut will be onboarded to the automated inventory management system in 2024.\nFinally, our custom-built super app, which provides smart automated routine management tools for our restaurant managers, is now used in over 8,500 Pizza Hut restaurants globally. And KFC has plans to roll this out to approximately 6,000 restaurants in 2024.\nFor the third pillar of our easy strategy, Easy Insights, we are fully leveraging our unique global scale to bring new insights and enable even smarter and quicker decision-making. This year, we expanded the reach of our Yum! Global Data Hub, which captures the vast majority of global transaction-level sales data and other key operational and customer metrics.\nIn 2024, our Easy Insights team will develop and test new AI-driven capabilities that pull from the global data hub and integrate into our own technology platforms, including personalized upsell recommendations for customers ordering on our digital platforms, intelligent menu pricing recommendations and dynamic restaurant routines for general managers.\nStepping back, it's incredibly encouraging to see this digital ecosystem come to life in our restaurants. By the end of 2024, we are likely to have our Taco Bell U.S. restaurants operating substantially all of these key technologies through the Yum! ecosystem. From the Poseidon point-of-sale system to the Yum! Commerce Platform, our automated inventory management software, and the tracks restaurant management application, truly a power brand powered by world-class technology.\nNext, I'll provide an update on our balance sheet and liquidity position. Our net leverage ratio ended the year at 4.2x, down from 5x last year. As we had previously shared, we had planned for our net leverage ratio to drift lower during 2023 based on pausing new debt financing, paying our $279 million revolver balance in Q1 and retiring a $325 million bond maturity in Q4.\nOur capital expenditures for the quarter, net of refranchising proceeds, were $103 million. Our net capital expenditures for the year came in at $225 million, reflecting $60 million in refranchising proceeds and $285 million in gross CapEx.\nFor the full year, we repurchased approximately 400,000 shares totaling $50 million. With the November bond maturity behind us and no significant debt maturities in 2024 or 2025, we will return to using our excess free cash flow to fund the share repurchases and any accretive investments we choose to make, for example, the U.K. KFC acquisition.\nIn addition, we were pleased to recently announce an 11% increase to the dividend. I will reiterate that our capital priorities are guided by maximizing shareholder value. This includes investing in the business, maintaining a resilient balance sheet, offering a competitive dividend and continuously evaluating the optimal use of our excess cash.\nFinally, let me shed some light on how 2024 is shaping up. Despite a more challenging operating environment, including the impact of the conflict in the Middle East, we expect to deliver our long-term growth algorithm in 2024. This includes core operating profit growth to be at least 8%, excluding the benefit of the 53rd week.\nWe have a strong unit development pipeline, thanks to attractive and reliable paybacks and growth-minded franchisees, which gives us confidence in our ability to deliver strong system sales growth. For the shape of the year, we expect top line trends in Q1 to be the most challenged with same-store sales trends improving sequentially as [indiscernible] and a range of sales-driving initiatives take hold.\nWe expect full year Taco Bell company operated margins to be in the range of 23% to 24%. We anticipate flat ex special G&A growth as we manage spend across the organization. Remember that G&A can vary due to the nature of our performance-based compensation plan. Lastly, we expect our full year tax rate to be in the range of 21% to 23%.\nTo close, I am incredibly proud of our performance this year. Sales trends became a little more challenging in the second half and yet we delivered profit growth above our algorithm as our teams quickly adjusted marketing calendars to meet demand and kept a strict focus on managing costs.\nIt is our team's relentless focus to stay vigilant on all areas of the business that gives me confidence we will deliver our long-term growth algorithm in 2024. The unbeatable combination of our iconic brands, best-in-class franchisees and resilient business model will enable us to deliver growth and shareholder value creation for years to come.\nWith that, operator, we are ready to take any questions."

Brands 2022 Second Quarter Earnings Call. My name is Seb, and I will be the operator for your call today. (Operator Instructions)\nI will now hand the floor over to Jodi Dyer, VP, Investor Relations.\n\nJodi Dyer\n\nVP of IR, Yum! Brands, Inc.\n\nThanks, operator. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. On our call today are David Gibbs, our CEO; Chris Turner, our CFO; and Dave Russell, our Senior Vice President and Corporate Controller. Following remarks from David and Chris, we'll open the call to questions. .\nBefore we get started, I would like to remind you that this conference call includes forward-looking statements that are subject to future events and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. All forward-looking statements are made only as of the date of this announcement and should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statements in our earnings release and the risk factors included in our filings with the SEC.\nIn addition, please refer to our earnings releases and relevant sections of our filings with the SEC to find disclosures and definitions of non-GAAP financial measures and other metrics that may be used on today's call as well as reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures.\nPlease note that during today's call, all system sales and operating profit results exclude the impact of foreign currency.\nNext, I'll provide an update on the financial reporting treatment related to the exit of our Russia business. During the second quarter, we completed the transfer of the Pizza Hut business to a local operator who has initiated the process of rebranding to a non-Yum! concept.\nGiven the transfer of Pizza Hut and our progress for the full exit from Russia for KFC, we have elected to remove the Russia business from key performance metrics. Specifically, 1,165 units in Russia and their associated system sales were removed from our total unit count and total system sales, respectively, as of the beginning of the second quarter. This negatively impacted our reported second quarter unit growth by 2 percentage points and our reported system sales growth, excluding foreign currency, by 2 percentage points.\nAdditionally, these units were removed from our same-store sales calculations and thus, do not impact our same-store sales results for the second quarter. However, we continue to include Russia and GAAP measures in the second quarter for Pizza Hut prior to the date of transfer and for KFC for the entire second quarter, including royalty revenue and all expenses to support the business and onetime expenses related to the transfer of ownership of the business.\nAs a result of our decision to exit the Russia business, we have reclassed net operating profits from the operating segment subsequent to the start of the conflict to our corporate and unallocated segment and reflected as a special item within the other income and expense line. For more information on our reporting calendar for each market, please visit the Financial Reports section of our website.\nWe are broadcasting this conference call via our website. This call is also being recorded and will be available for playback. Please be advised that if you ask a question, it will be included in both our live conference and any future use of the recording.\nWe would like to make you aware of upcoming Yum! investor events in the following. Disclosures pertaining to outstanding debt in our restricted group capital structure will be provided at the time of our Form 10-Q filing. Third quarter earnings will be released on November 2, 2022, with the conference call on the same day.\nFinally, as a reminder, we'll be hosting an in-person Yum! Brands Investor Day on Tuesday, December 13, 2022, at the New York Stock Exchange. Please stay tuned for more details.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. David Gibbs.\n\nDavid W. Gibbs\n\nCEO & Director, Yum! Brands, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jodi, and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter results are a testament to the resilience of our iconic brands and the power of our highly franchised business in this complex operating environment. System sales grew 5% after adjusting for the exclusion of our Russia business, driven by sustained development momentum. We opened 781 gross new units in the quarter with broad-based contributions from each of our brands.\nAdditionally, we delivered positive same-store sales growth while lapping last year's growth of 23%, the strongest quarter of same-store sales growth in Yum!'s history.\nWe're pleased with the continued growth in our digital business with sales of nearly $6 billion, fueled by the adoption of our global platforms and capabilities. Our unmatched global scale and digital capabilities are key differentiators in the restaurant industry, and these competitive advantages enable us to thrive in any environment.\nI'll now share a few global trends from the quarter. As Yum China shared on its earnings call last week, COVID-related restrictions continued throughout the quarter, significantly impacting second quarter results. However, trends outside of China remains strong. Our consolidated same-store sales, excluding China, grew 6% for the quarter. Despite a complex consumer landscape in the U.S., Taco Bell U.S. is not yet out of the park with 8% same-store sales growth. The team achieved these results through exceptional execution of a well-balanced marketing agenda that sustained the brand buzz, distinctive product news and compelling value offerings and that was all supported by operational improvements and a focus on elevating the digital experience.\nAdditionally, emerging markets, excluding China, continued to recover to pre-COVID levels, driven by the reopening of dining rooms and growth in our digital business. In fact, same-store sales growth for emerging markets, excluding China, was up 22%, a 4-point acceleration from the prior quarter. We remain confident that we are well positioned to win in this environment given our iconic brands that customers love, strong consumer value proposition, scale advantages, expanded digital access and sophisticated franchise partners with unmatched operating capability.\nBefore I provide an update on our growth drivers, I'd like to share an update on our ongoing process to exit Russia. Last month, we shared that we completed the transfer of ownership of our Pizza Hut business in Russia to a local operator who has initiated the process of rebranding locations to a non-Yum! concept.\nAs for our KFC restaurants in Russia, we are in advanced stages of transferring ownership, operating systems and master franchise rights, including the network of franchise restaurants to a local operator who will be responsible for rebranding locations to a non-Yum! concept. Upon the completion of this process, we will have fully exited from Russia.\nOur franchisees and team members in Ukraine continue to demonstrate incredible fortitude through this conflict. And I'm proud to report that nearly all of our stores in Ukraine have reopened to serve the people of Ukraine while ensuring the safety of our team members.\nNow I'll talk about 2 of our growth drivers, our Relevant, Easy and Distinctive Brands, or RED for short, and our Unrivaled Culture and Talent. Then I'll provide an update on our Recipe for Good. Chris will share the details of our second quarter financial results, including an update on our capital strategy before providing an update on our unmatched operating capabilities and bold restaurant development growth driver.\nLet me begin with our Relevant, Easy and Distinctive Brands. Our KFC Division, which accounts for 49% of our operating profit grew system sales 1% this quarter, driven by 3% unit growth and a 1% decline in same-store sales. Adjusting last year for the exclusion of Russia, KFC Division system sales growth was 4%, with 7% unit growth. Continued sales weakness in China contributed to significant year-over-year pressure in the quarter. Excluding China, our same-store sales grew 7%.\nSo China remains difficult to forecast, pressures gradually improved throughout the quarter. However, as Yum China said last week, given the recurrence of COVID outbreaks, the sales recovery will likely be nonlinear and uneven.\nIt's been well noted that many developed markets experienced increasing macro pressures and headwinds to consumer spending this quarter. In addition, the U.S. and U.K. markets faced tough compares due to government stimulus last year. While KFC U.S. face difficult laps from stimulus and the successful launch of the chicken sandwich platform, we're pleased to share that same-store sales growth improved sequentially throughout the quarter.\nHowever, the macro pressures were not felt consistently across all developed markets in our portfolio. For example, Australia grew system sales 7% as same-store sales growth doubled from the prior quarter. This strong demand has followed the introduction of modern menu, which highlights our uniquely craveable products and contemporary value offers.\nTurning to our emerging markets, which delivered remarkable results in the quarter. I'd like to highlight India, the Middle East and Latin America. In India, where system sales grew 103%, the team continued to advance their digital ecosystem and provide consumers with disruptive value offering. System sales grew 41% in the Middle East driven by accelerating digital sales that grew approximately 70% year-over-year even as dine-in sales continue to recover.\nThe launch of Click & Collect functionalities including QR code ordering via the KFC app and several of our Middle East markets helped drive these results. The Latin America market achieved 32% system sales growth, propelled by a well-balanced marketing strategy, including a focus on product innovation and dedication to value offerings while advancing digital capabilities following the launch of the KFC mobile app and kiosks. Our diverse global portfolio is one of the many reasons we have great confidence we're well positioned in the current environment.\nTurning to our Taco Bell Division, which accounts for 36% of our operating profit, system sales grew 10%, driven by 4% unit growth and 8% same-store sales growth. Taco Bell continues to fire on all cylinders as evidenced by the broad-based strength of its second quarter results. For Taco Bell U.S., system sales grew 9%, driven by 8% same-store sales growth and 2% unit growth. Taco Bell remains a culture leader in the industry, successfully executing on its strategy to inspire and enable the world to Live Más through innovative marketing campaigns, buzzworthy brand news, distinctive products and strong value offering. Despite significant inflation, Taco Bell maintained restaurant margins by leveraging its pricing power for premium products and craveable LTOs, while still providing consumers with everyday value through a broad range of price points such as those items featured on the Cravings Value Menu.\nThe return of the Mexican Pizza as an LTO this quarter is a prime demonstration of these strengths. Taco Bell's most loyal fans were granted early access, increasing the average loyalty registrations 15x during the 2 days of early access and fueling 10% growth in loyalty members in the quarter.\nDemand for the Mexican Pizza was 7x previous levels, reaching over 20 million pizzas sold nationwide, with some stores selling out within a week, creating a sustained positive halo for the brand. Given the overwhelmingly positive reaction from our customers, we're excited to bring back the Mexican Pizza in the fall, when it will become a permanent fixture on the menu.\nAt Taco Bell International, system sales grew 31%, owing to 27% unit growth and 9% same-store sales growth. 5 of our 7 European markets saw double-digit same-store sales growth, thanks to the balanced execution of everyday value and disruptive value while also continuing to grow brand awareness. Taco Bell International is building on its development momentum and now meaningfully contributes to the division's total unit growth.\nMoving on to the Pizza Hut Division, which accounts for 15% of our operating profit. Q2 system sales were flat, driven by 4% unit growth and a 3% same-store sales decline. At Pizza Hut International, which represents 8% of our operating profit, system sales grew 3%, led by 7% unit growth and a 2% decline in same-store sales.\nAs I mentioned before, COVID lockdowns in China led to sales softness in the quarter. Excluding China, Pizza Hut International same-store sales grew 6%.\nI'd like to highlight 2 of our leading markets for the quarter, India and Latin America. India system sales grew 79%, a 35-point acceleration from the prior quarter, driven by further recovery in dine-in sales and home meal replacement strength. System sales grew 18% in the Middle East, where the team has successfully executed a balanced strategy of offering everyday value and customized products, with particular success from the My Box offering. My Box offers a compelling entry price point that is well positioned to serve the individual eater and lunch occasion and is now live in nearly 50 markets.\nAt Pizza Hut U.S., which represents 7% of our operating profit, system sales declined 3%, driven by flat unit growth and a 4% decline in same-store sales, driven in large part by continued operational challenges in our delivery business. We made progress expanding system-wide adoption of third-party delivery as a service to help address our delivery driver capacity constraints to meet consumer demand. As of the end of Q2, approximately 55% of our U.S. locations have implemented delivery as a service, up from 40% at the beginning of the quarter.\nAdditionally, we're leaning into our aggregator partnerships by joining third-party marketplaces, so our consumers can access our craveable food wherever they shop. As of the end of Q2, roughly 70% of eligible stores have opted into using at least 1 aggregator marketplace, up from approximately 45% at the beginning of Q2. Finally, the team shifted promotional focus towards compelling value to address the needs of the consumer.\nLastly, the Habit Burger Grill grew system sales 10%, driven by 15% unit growth and 4% same-store sales decline. During National Burger Month, Habit provided exclusive offers through its mobile app, resulting in a 10% increase in mobile app installed, while also highlighting its culinary-inspired innovation, which included the Spicy Green Beans, a spicy twist on its signature tempura-battered green beans.\nMoving on to our Unrivaled Culture and Talent growth driver. We continue to see growth of our unrivaled talent with Tarun Lal being named President of KFC U.S. and Shannon Hennessy taking on a new role as President of the Habit Burger Grill. Tarun is a prime example of growth from within, joining our organization 25 years ago and serving in various leadership positions. He is not only a best-in-class operator known for driving breakthrough results, he's also a driver of our culture. I'm confident Tarun's leadership and winning partnership mindset with our franchisees, will be an asset as we drive the next chapter of growth for the KFC U.S. business.\nShannon joined Yum! a few years ago as a KFC Global CFO and immediately hit the ground running. She has a unique ability to work across functions and bring people together to solve problems, drive change and deliver meaningful results for our business. She's also a standout culture leader with a commitment to growing talent and to advancing equity inclusion and belonging.\nWhen it comes to our Recipe for Good, we recently published our Annual Global Citizenship & Sustainability Report, which highlights our strategic investments in socially responsible growth and stewardship of our people, food and impact on the planet. The report includes updates on our key commitments, including our social purpose and how we've awarded more than $50 million in grants to nearly 30 social impact programs globally. This is accomplished through Yum's! unlocking opportunity initiative, that champions equity and inclusion, education and entrepreneurship for frontline restaurant teams and communities around the world. It reinforces our industry-leading commitment to food safety as well as our efforts to respond to customers' evolving preferences and improve the nutritional value of our menu items.\nFinally, the report also highlights our environmental commitments, including our Science Based Targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions nearly 50% by 2030 as well as a newly harmonized packaging policy across our brands that commits to moving all consumer-facing plastic packaging to be reusable, recyclable or compostable by 2025.\nTo wrap up, our performance continues to demonstrate the power of our unmatched global scale in a challenging operating environment. Thanks to the advantages of our unrivaled talent, global development capabilities and expanding technology platforms and capabilities, our iconic brands continue to drive consistent growth. Our best-in-class teams and franchise partners are committed to serving up the most loved, trusted and fastest-growing restaurant brands in the world.\nWith that, Chris, over to you.\n\nChristopher Lee Turner\n\nCFO, Yum! Brands, Inc.\n\nThank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our financial results, our bold restaurant development and unmatched operating capability growth drivers and our capital strategy.\nI'll begin with an overview of our second quarter financial results. Adjusting last year for the exclusion of Russia in our reported results, system sales grew 5%, underpinned by 6% unit growth and 1% same-store sales growth. Despite more severe inflation this quarter, our teams achieved strong performance, demonstrating the resilience of Yum!'s business model.\nAs you may recall, we shared during our last earnings call that Q2 core operating profit growth would look similar to Q1, given continued softness in China, a full quarter impact from lost Russia profits and a headwind from normalized G&A spend in comparison to 2021. I'm pleased to report that we exceeded our previous guidance, with core operating profit down 1% for the quarter, owing to outperformance at the Taco Bell Division. Ex special, general and administrative expenses were $252 million, tracking in line with our expectations for $1.1 billion of G&A expense for fiscal 2022, consistent with our previous guidance. Despite double-digit labor and commodity inflation in the U.S., Taco Bell company-owned restaurant margins of 26% were in line year-over-year and 200 basis points ahead of the pre-COVID Q2 2019 margins. This is a testament to the brand's pricing power and the operational efficiencies the team continues to achieve both contributing to best-in-class unit economics.\nThe FX impact to reported operating profit was $23 million, nearly double our expectations shared on our first quarter earnings call. We now expect the full year FX headwind to reported operating profit to be approximately $70 million to $90 million and expect similar amounts in Q3 and Q4 as those reported in Q2.\nFinally, EPS, excluding special items, was $1.05, a 9% decrease year-over-year. However, there was a $0.13 impact to EPS driven by items that are nonoperating in nature, including higher foreign currency exchange, an increase in our effective tax rate and a decrease in the value of our investment in Devyani International Limited.\nI'm pleased to report that given the strength across our diversified portfolio, we are reiterating our fiscal 2022 guidance that we shared on our first quarter earnings call. As a reminder, other than core operating profit growth due to the removal of Russia profits, we expect to deliver on all parts of the long-term growth algorithm this year. With this impact, we anticipate full year core operating profit growth of mid-single digits.\nAnd as we previously mentioned, that profit growth is weighted to the second half of the year, especially the fourth quarter, largely owing to timing of G&A expense in comparison to 2021.\nNext, I'll discuss our unmatched operating capabilities through the lens of our digital strategy, easy experiences, easy operations and easy insights.\nFirst, I'll provide an update on our efforts to create easy experiences for our customers. This quarter, Taco Bell franchisee, Border Foods, owned and operated by the Engler family, opened one of the most revolutionary restaurant formats in the industry's history, Taco Bell Defy. Taco Bell Defy features one of the most innovative drive-thru experiences yet. It's a first-of-its-kind 2-story restaurant design, featuring a proprietary vertical list to transport iconic, craveable Taco Bell menu items straight from the kitchen to pans. This is on top of unique digital check-in screens for mobile orders that enable a differentiated, fun and seamless experience for consumers.\nTaco Bell Defy boast many features that could show up in future Taco Bell restaurants given it is a hit with consumers and performing well.\nAt KFC Africa, the team doubled kiosk penetration in its store footprint, with significant commitments to further deploy across the majority of the system by year-end. Kiosks served to modernize our assets, improve customer experience and drive greater insights into customer behavior.\nAdditionally, we continue to deploy Tictuk's chat and e-commerce products across our global portfolio and surpassed 2,400 stores in 43 markets this quarter, serving KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell.\nEarlier in the year, Pizza Hut Germany launched its new e-commerce website, fully powered by Tictuk. Germany has seen impressive early results, including a 15% increase in conversion rate and a EUR 2 increase in average ticket when compared to previous performance on aggregator platforms in the market. We are seeing similar success stories across the markets where it Tictuk is live.\nNext, I'll provide an update on our efforts to enhance the team member experience as part of our easy operations initiative. Pizza Hut International reached 25 markets using the Dragontail system, bringing global adoption of this platform to 28 markets across both KFC and Pizza Hut brands.\nWe also made significant progress during the quarter in the rollout of digital order pickup shelves, including adding shelves at 100 more Habit Burger Grill stores. Approximately 2/3 of our Habit Burger Grill stores are now equipped with pickup shelves. Taco Bell also has joined our other brands in the U.S. to deploy pickup shelves, which are now fully deployed across company-operated stores with plans to roll out across the rest of the system by early 2023.\nExpanding options and ease for off-premise consumption improves the customer, delivery driver and team member experience.\nFinally, I'll discuss our efforts around easy insights. Our data and analytics experts, along with Kvantum, the AI-based marketing analytics team we acquired last year, continue to scale a Kvantum media optimization tool, while also developing additional AI and machine learning products that drive performance for Yum! and our franchisees. As an example, they are currently partnering with Taco Bell and KFC U.S. to test and deploy an inventory management tool that helps our restaurant managers more accurately forecast food and supplies. The tool is driven by our cutting-edge demand forecasting platform. Based on encouraging early results, we plan to scale this platform throughout the remainder of the year.\nMoving on to our Bold Restaurant Development growth driver. We sustained our robust development momentum this quarter. At KFC, we opened over 400 gross new units, reaching nearly 1,000 gross new units opened year-to-date. China, India and the Middle East led development this quarter, each opening more than 40 gross new units. It's worth noting that the year-to-date development pace is attributable to a broad contribution from our emerging markets outside of China.\nAt Pizza Hut, we opened nearly 300 gross new units, leading to over 600 gross new units opened year-to-date. The Pizza Hut Division remains on pace to set another development record this year with significant contributions from India, China and Indonesia.\nFor the third consecutive quarter, Taco Bell International Development outpaced Taco Bell U.S. development, opening 46 net new restaurants in Q2 and 67 year-to-date. For the first time, full year Taco Bell International development is on pace to surpass U.S. development this year.\nOur broad-based development continues to be driven by healthy unit economics, significant white space and our world-class franchise partners who are committed to growth. This global development momentum, coupled with the visibility we have into our development pipeline, gives us line of sight to deliver unit growth within our long-term growth algorithm range of 4% to 5%.\nNext, I'll provide an update on our balance sheet and liquidity position. Our capital priorities remain unchanged: invest in the business, maintain a healthy balance sheet, pay a competitive dividend and return the remaining excess cash to shareholders via share repurchases. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $412 million, excluding restricted cash.\nOn April 1, we closed on a new $1 billion, 5.375% YBI bond due in 2032. The majority of the proceeds were used to call our $600 million, 7.75% YBI bond due in 2025. We closed the quarter in line with our net leverage target of 5x. We have a well-positioned capital structure and debt guideline for a high inflation environment, considering approximately 94% of our debt is fixed with no significant maturities for the next 3 years.\nCapital expenditures for the quarter, net of refranchising proceeds, were $38 million. Our full year expectation for $250 million in net capital expenditures remains unchanged, now reflecting $65 million in refranchising proceeds and up to $315 million in gross CapEx.\nWith respect to our share buyback program, during the quarter, we repurchased 1.3 million shares at an average share price of $118 per share, totaling approximately $150 million.\nIn closing, I'm pleased with the resilience of our performance in the quarter. The structural advantages of our globally diversified, highly franchised business model and our unmatched scale uniquely position us to navigate complex and uncertain macro environments with incredible stability. I remain confident that our global portfolio provides investors a high-quality, defensive growth opportunity with visibility into consistent compounding returns.\nWith that, operator, we are ready to take any questions."

Gibbs\n\nPresident, Chief Financial Officer & Chief Operating Officer, Yum! Brands, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jodi, and good morning, everyone. At our Investor Day last December, we shared our long-term vision for Yum! to deliver accelerated global growth. I'm proud to say that our second quarter results are further evidence of our ability to execute against this vision. Two of them differentiated capabilities, our Bold Restaurant Development engine, including 1,025 gross new units in the current quarter; and our distinctive digital capabilities, which drove record digital sales, fueled the second quarter's 13% growth in system sales.\nI'm especially pleased to report that based on our strong year-to-date results and the continued momentum we see in our business, we expect to deliver full year 2023 results well above our long-term growth algorithm.\nI'll start with a few high-level thoughts on our second quarter results before sharing some additional details through the lens of the Relevant, Easy and Distinctive brands and Unrivaled Culture and Talent pillars of our Recipe for Good Growth framework. Chris will then provide some additional color on our second quarter results, followed by an update on our Bold Restaurant Development and Unmatched Operating Capabilities growth pillars.\nFor the second quarter, we delivered same-store sales growth of 9% and unit growth of 6% with KFC setting the pace with a remarkable 19% system sales growth on the foundation of our industry-leading development momentum, distinctive marketing campaigns and relevant new product layers, such as the launch of original recipe hand breaded chicken nuggets here in the U.S. And as I'm sure you've all heard, Taco Bell, in partnership with another global icon, LeBron James, successfully liberated Taco Tuesday in a way no other brand could mimic. As we also discussed in December, our Recipe for Good Growth strategy will be powered by digital and technology. Our distinctive digital capabilities, which enable easier experiences and greater access to our iconic brands, continues to unlock incremental sales through higher spend and frequency as well as incremental profitability for our system.\nOn that note, I'm pleased to report another quarter of double-digit growth, resulting in $7 billion in digital sales, representing over 45% of our global system sales.\nTurning back to our Recipe for Good Growth and our iconic R.E.D. brands, let me start with the KFC division, which represents 50% of our divisional operating profits. Second quarter system sales growth of 19% was driven by 13% same-store sales growth and 7% unit growth. Widespread transaction growth and a strong recovery in our China market, as Yum China detailed in the results earlier this week, powered our same-store sales growth.\nHowever, even outside of China, KFC Global same-store sales growth was up an impressive 10% in the quarter. KFC represents our largest digital business globally on a dollar basis and showed continued momentum with strong year-over-year growth in both digital sales and mix.\nAmong KFC's emerging markets, I'd like to highlight our Middle East team for the work they did to drive system sales with a focus on their core menu and new snacking product offerings and the South Africa team for their efforts to grow the breakfast layer through a bold marketing campaign with Trevor Noah. Thanks to unlocking additional customer use occasions, compelling value offerings and continued digital growth, both markets posted strong same-store sales growth.\nAmong our developed markets, Western Europe led the way with strong results in check and transactions by balancing disruptive value and core menu items.\nTurning to KFC U.S. Same-store sales grew 5%, improving sequentially with the combination of product innovation and an Always On value strategy. Building on first quarter momentum behind Wraps, KFC U.S. launched hand breaded original recipe chicken nuggets to expand its off-the-bone chicken offerings, leveraging the learnings from our significant off-the-bone business at KFC International. This product innovation was met with an immediate positive consumer reaction resulting in over 100 million nuggets sold in the first 8 weeks after launch. These boneless offerings appeal to younger and new KFC customers and build upon an already well-established sales layer following the successful launch of the chicken sandwich in 2021.\nMoving on to the Taco Bell Division, which represents 35% of our global divisional operating profit and roughly 75% of our U.S. divisional operating process. Once again, I'm thrilled to share more external recognition of Taco Bell's brand power and relevance with the brand's inclusion on the Time 100 List of the World's Most Influential Companies. This category of one brand remains ever relevant by pushing boundaries and introducing and reintroducing exciting and craveable menu items and always being part of the cultural moment and conversation.\nCongrats to the entire Taco Bell team and our incredible franchisees for yet another well-deserved honor.\nFor the second quarter, Taco Bell's global system sales grew 7%, led by 4% same-store sales growth and 5% unit growth. Taco Bell continues to execute its magic growth formula through a balanced set of commercial strategies, including building brand buzz, unparalleled value, Mas occasions and digital initiatives.\nThis quarter, the team launched a campaign to liberate Taco Tuesday in a first-ever global Taco Tuesday campaign spanning 19 markets in partnership with a true global icon, LeBron James. The campaign created massive brand buzz with engagement and mentions in 1 week for Taco Tuesday liberation surpassing the entirety of the highly successful Mexican pizza relaunch last year.\nOther promotions in the quarter contributing to Taco Bell's winning Magic Growth formula include both our $5 Cravings Trio and Deluxe Build Your Own Cravings box that helps sustain our strong consumer value proposition and maintain over 25% margins.\nIn addition, an expansion of trading hours with strong growth at both the breakfast and late night dayparts helped Taco Bell's second quarter results.\nFinally, the team continues to create incremental demand for their digital channels. In the U.S., digital sales increased almost 35% year-over-year with kiosks now deployed in 100% of Taco Bell stores.\nTaking all of this into account, it is no surprise Taco Bell continues to be a leader in value perception while also delivering amazing unit economics.\nFor Taco Bell International, system sales grew 18% driven by development momentum. The global Taco Tuesday campaign, which launched in June and will continue through the third quarter, leverages Taco Bell's U.S. cultural leadership, building brand equity and consumer awareness with a consistent look and feel around the world.\nI also want to highlight Taco Bell's continued progress against our Recipe for Good Growth strategy that included raising $20 million so far this year through its roundup fundraiser. Throughout the quarter, the Taco Bell Foundation donated these funds to over 400 nonprofits and nearly 1,000 Live Mas scholarships.\nNext, I'll discuss the Pizza Hut division, which accounts for 14% of our divisional operating profit. System sales grew 7% for the quarter, driven by 4% same-store sales growth and 4% unit growth. Pizza Hut International grew system sales 11%, led by 6% same-store sales growth and 5% unit growth.\nThe individual occasion continued to be a growth driver largely on incremental transaction growth from the Melts platform, which in the U.S. has proven to be a self-sustaining layer at an attractive entry price point. Since launching in the U.S. late last year, Melts has now reached 35 markets, up significantly from the 11 markets in the first quarter now in over half of our global store base.\nMelts is delivering encouraging early results alongside My Box, our other international individual occasion product offering. Our team is focused on providing distinctive value offerings across markets such as the Super Limo Abundant value deal in the UAE and the national pizza party promotion in Australia.\nPizza Hut U.S. grew system sales 2%, driven by 1% same-store sales growth. In the U.S., we introduced new labor profile to our Melts platform, providing yet another reason for customers to order from Pizza Hut.\nThe Habit Burger Grill division grew system sales 9% on 7% unit growth. The Habit team continues to lean into its menu strategy of Culinary Forward limited time offerings highlighting its craft brand positioning through their elevated craveable offering. We continue to expand access points for our customers with the rollout of kiosks, now in over 60% of stores. An average kiosk sales see 10% higher checks compared with front counter sales, an excellent profit flow-through, yet another proof point of the value from converting to digital sales.\nMoving to our Unrivaled Culture and Talent growth driver, which continues to be the foundation of our success. To start, I'd like to recognize Taco Bell Division CEO, Mark King, who will retire at the end of the year. As we celebrate the legacy that Mark will leave at Taco Bell, we're thrilled that Sean Tresvant will become the CEO of the Taco Bell Division effective January 2024. Sean joined Taco Bell's Chief Brand Officer 2 years ago and earlier this year, expanded his role to Global Chief Brand and Strategy Officer. With Sean's clear vision and strong track record of driving transformative R.E.D. innovation I'm confident that Taco Bell will continue to successfully execute its long-term global growth strategy.\nThis is a great reminder of how people are truly at the center of everything we do, which is also reinforced in our global Citizenship & Sustainability Report, which was published last month. The report outlines our strategic investments in socially responsible growth, risk management and sustainable stewardship of our 3 priority pillars of people, food and planet. I'd like to take a moment to highlight work on key issues across each pillar, including the quality packaging and carbon reduction.\nWe remain committed to our purpose of unlocking opportunity in part through our $100 million commitment over 5 years that we announced in 2020 to knock down barriers to equity inclusion, education and entrepreneurship around the world. Through our Unlocking Opportunity initiative, we have funded and activated more than 30 social impact programs in 11 countries enabling markets to develop localized programs to deliver meaningful change in communities where we operate.\nWe also continued to make progress towards achieving vendor parity and leadership roles by 2030 with 43% of global leadership roles held by women in 2022. These are just 2 examples of the great progress we've made and of how Yum!'s commitment to its people first culture has never been stronger.\nIn addition, we continue to make progress around sustainable packaging, building upon our harmonized cross-brand packaging policy that was introduced last year. Furthermore, we've had great success as we march toward our climate goals to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by nearly 50% by 2030. To date, our teams have achieved a 57% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions at corporate restaurants and offices, coupled with a 28% reduction at franchise restaurants.\nReflecting on the first half of the year, our teams have put forward an impressive set of results. And looking forward, the picture we see for the second half of the year will be similarly strong. Our confidence comes from our Recipe for Good Growth strategy and the fact that category leaders, Taco Bell U.S. and KFC International, drive 80% of Yum!'s divisional operating profit. The vast majority of our U.S. operating profit is driven by Taco Bell, a leading brand in both cultural relevancy and affordability, while globally, KFC is positioned with unmatched scale advantages and growth-minded franchise partners eager to capitalize on opportunities in their markets and widen their competitive moat.\nIn an uncertain environment, we know that consumers make decisions with value in mind. The good news is that our brands have always stood for tremendous value in addition to convenience, experience and craveable food. This is a winning combination that will continue to differentiate us from our competitors. And when coupled with our Recipe for Good Growth strategy, I am confident that we can continue to deliver on our long-term vision for accelerated global growth in 2023 and beyond.\nWith that, Chris, over to you.\n\nChristopher Lee Turner\n\nCFO, Yum! Brands, Inc.\n\nThank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our second quarter financial results and our Bold Restaurant Development and Unmatched Operating Capability growth drivers before turning to our capital strategy.\nI'll begin with our second quarter results. We delivered 13% system sales growth driven by 9% same-store sales growth and 6% unit growth. Digital sales improved at all 4 of our brands with total digital sales up nearly 30% year-over-year. Core operating profit for the quarter grew 12%. Taco Bell store level margins were an impressive 25% and 6%. We continue to expect full year Taco Bell company-operated margins to be similar to margins in 2022 and Taco Bell's ability to deliver such strong margin performance despite mid-single-digit inflation once again demonstrates the power and resilience of their business model and preserves their compelling unit economics, which remain near an all-time high.\nFor Habit, company-operated margins improved to 11%, thanks to better leverage of Yum!'s purchasing scale as well as efforts to improve store level labor productivity. We're encouraged with the margin improvement progress at Habit and we'll continue to invest in the long-term growth of the business.\nAnd as a result, we expect a small operating loss for the division this year. Ex special general and administrative expenses were $280 million, in line with our expectations. The ex special tax rate for the quarter was 18%.\nFinally, our second quarter EPS, excluding special items, was $1.41 per share. Second quarter EPS was positively impacted by unrealized investment gains of $0.09 relating to our investment in Devyani, offset by a negative foreign currency translation impact of $0.05.\nGiven our strong first half results and continuing momentum into the second half of the year, I'm happy to report that we expect on a full year basis to over deliver on all components of our long-term growth algorithm. We expect full year 2023 core operating profit to grow low double digits, which is ahead of our long-term guidance of at least 8%.\nWe expect second half G&A expenses to be modestly higher relative to our initial plan, primarily attributable to above-target incentive compensation accruals resulting from our strong performance and which we began recording in Q2.\nAs a reminder, employee incentive compensation is tied to internal performance targets linked to components of our long-term growth algorithm. The accrual we booked throughout the year can go up or down depending on our performance.\nConsistent with our prior G&A guidance, we still expect our year-over-year G&A growth to be lower in the second half of the year. Balance of year, we expect the third quarter year-over-year G&A growth rate to look similar to the growth rate in the first half, followed by a year-over-year decline in the fourth quarter.\nFinally, we faced a $44 million foreign currency headwind year-to-date, and our current forecast is for little to no FX impact to reported operating profit in the balance of the year.\nNow moving on to Bold Restaurant Development. We opened 1,025 gross new units during the quarter, contributing to 6% unit growth. We are encouraged by the excitement among our growth-ready franchise partners who see broad consumer appeal for our brands and enormous white space opportunity in their markets and who are enthusiastic about Yum!'s unmatched operating capabilities.\nWe continue to expect that the benefits of our scale and the health of our franchise system will allow us to further widen our development advantage relative to the industry. As you've heard me say before, the Yum! system is made up of world-class franchise partners who are truly 3C: committed, capable and well capitalized.\nAs a result, we expect 2023 will be another incredible year of development, similar to 2021 and 2022, which were both industry record-setting years.\nLet me share a few highlights of our unit development in the quarter, beginning with the KFC Division, which opened 600 gross new units. Yum China's development momentum reaccelerated with 375 gross new units opened this quarter, putting their year-to-date development ahead of last year's pace. The remainder of KFC's unit growth was widespread across markets led by India the Middle East and Asia.\nAs for the Pizza Hut Division, the team opened 357 gross new units, led by China, India, Spain, Turkey and the U.S. with each opening at least 20 units. In June, the Flynn Restaurant Group announced its first international expansion with an agreement to acquire Pizza Hut Australia, which owns approximately 260 Pizza Hut units. This is a great example of a 3C partner eager to grow within our system.\nFor those unfamiliar with the Flynn Restaurant Group, they are the largest franchise operator in the U.S. restaurant industry with roughly 2,400 restaurants, including nearly 300 Taco Bells and nearly 1,000 Pizza Huts. For some perspective, in 2022, Flynn accounted for roughly 20% of the Pizza Hut U.S. new builds, and their overall same-store sales growth significantly outperformed the rest of the U.S. system.\nTaco Bell development remains on track for another record-setting year with 63 gross new units, including 27 in international markets across 8 countries.\nTotaling it all up Yum!'s first half unit development reflects nearly 1,800 gross new units, a fantastic result that demonstrates the resilience of Yum!'s development engine despite a more challenging macro environment.\nNext, I'll turn to our unmatched operating capabilities that contribute to our position as the global franchisor of choice. This includes our distinctive digital strategy to unlock improved customer experiences that lead to faster sales growth and better store level margins.\nWith that, let me discuss the 3 pillars of our digital strategy. Beginning with the Easy Experiences pillar, this quarter, the KFC U.S. team leveraged the Yum! commerce platform, which was first launched with KFC U.S. in 2021 to enable a Diablo IV limited-time promotion in partnership with Activision Blizzard and offered customers exclusive in-game rewards in exchange for KFC purchases.\nBy leveraging our in-house technology, we were able to build the necessary infrastructure and integrations to support this exciting gaming promotion in a matter of weeks. Previously, the process would have taken months with significant third-party expense. This quarter, we achieved a significant milestone in expanding the Yum! commerce platform as Taco Bell U.S. migrated its digital traffic onto the platform. All of Taco Bell's web, mobile and delivery-as-a-service digital transactions are now processed through this platform. Additionally, Pizza Hut Peru became the first international market to begin using the Yum! commerce platform this quarter.\nWe will continue to migrate additional brands and markets to the Yum! commerce platform over the coming quarters. including Pizza Hut U.S. throughout 2023 and several international markets.\nWithin the Easy Operations pillar, we continue to expand adoption of both recommended ordering and our Yum! point-of-sale system. As you may recall, recommended ordering is an AI machine learning module that predicts and recommends the quantity of each product a restaurant general manager should order. Recommended ordering was deployed in another 800 stores this quarter and is now live in over 4,400 KFC and Taco Bell U.S. stores.\nOur Yum! next-generation cloud-first point of sale system improves operational efficiencies and enhances team member effectiveness. Taco Bell U.S. is leading this rollout, having deployed this system to 1,000 stores this quarter and targeting 5,000 stores by year-end.\nFinally, for our Easy Insights pillar, we are advancing our digital strategy and using a new customer data platform solution to provide a unified view of customers across our U.S. brands and third-party aggregators. This will enable us to improve digital experiences for our customers and ultimately increase customer frequency. Eventually, this and other internal programs will provide the infrastructure to unlock personalized marketing, joint branding and future automation. This is the latest step in our vision to one day achieve 100% of sales powered by digital.\nLastly, I'll provide an update on our balance sheet and liquidity position. As a reminder, our strategy is to enable growth while maximizing shareholder value. In doing that, our capital priorities remain unchanged: investing in the business for the long term, maintaining a resilient balance sheet, paying a competitive dividend and maximizing shareholder value by returning excess capital through debt paydown and share repurchases.\nNet capital expenditures for the quarter were $34 million, reflecting $60 million in gross CapEx and $26 million in refranchising proceeds. Our net leverage ratio declined to 4.7x, reflecting our previously stated intention to allow net leverage to drift modestly lower this year.\nKeep in mind, we have an upcoming bond maturity of $325 million in November of this year, our only maturity until 2026.\nFurthermore, our current outstanding debt has a weighted average remaining term of 6 years. And our greater than 90% fixed floating ratio is attractive in the current market environment. We paid down $164 million on our revolver, leaving a minimal balance at the end of the quarter.\nWe continue to evaluate the best use of our excess capital, and at current interest rates, we believe funding our upcoming debt maturity before share repurchases best optimizes shareholder value.\nTo round out our prepared remarks, I'm incredibly pleased with our strong year-to-date results and continued momentum, giving us confidence we will deliver full year 2023 results well above our long-term growth algorithm. Our brand teams and franchise operators remain vigilant in the pursuit to maximize performance, and in turn, deliver exceptional shareholder value.\nWith that, operator, we are ready to take any questions."

My name is Ruby, and I will be your moderator for today's call. (Operator Instructions)\nI will now hand over to our host, Jodi Dyer, VP of Investor Relations, to begin.\n\nJodi Dyer\n\nVP of IR and CFO of Digital & Technology, Yum! Brands, Inc.\n\nThanks, operator. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. On our call today are David Gibbs, our CEO; Chris Turner, our CFO; and Dave Russell, our Senior Vice President and Corporate Controller. Following remarks from David and Chris, we'll open the call to questions.\nBefore we get started, I would like to remind you that this conference call includes forward-looking statements that are subject to future events and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. All forward-looking statements are made only as of the date of this announcement and should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statements in our earnings release and the risk factors included in our filings with the SEC. In addition, please refer to our earnings releases and relevant sections of our filings with the SEC to find disclosures and definitions of non-GAAP financial measures and other metrics that may be used in today's call as well as reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures.\nPlease note that during today's call, all system sales and operating profit results exclude the impact of foreign currency. Additionally, as it relates to our Russia business, our operating results for the first quarter continue to reflect revenues and expenses related to Russia within their historical financial statement line items and operating segments. However, we have reclassed net operating profit attributable to Russia for the month of March that had not yet been redirected to humanitarian efforts as of the end of the quarter from the operating segments in which it was earned to our corporate and unallocated segment. Those operating profits have been reflected within other income/expense and reflected as a special item. David and Chris will provide additional context in their prepared remarks. For more information on our reporting calendar for each market, please visit the Financial Reports section of our website.\nWe are broadcasting this conference call via our website. This call is also being recorded and will be available for playback. Please be advised that if you ask a question, it will be included in both our live conference and in any future use of the recording.\nWe would like to make you aware of upcoming Yum! investor events and the following. Disclosures pertaining to outstanding debt in our restricted group capital structure will be provided at the time of our Form 10-Q filing. Second quarter earnings will be released on August 3, 2022, with a conference call on the same day. Finally, we will be hosting an in-person Yum! Brands Investor Day on Tuesday, December 13, 2022, at the New York Stock Exchange. Stay tuned for more details.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. David Gibbs.\n\nDavid W. Gibbs\n\nCEO & Director, Yum! Brands, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jodi, and good morning, everyone. Before I go over our first quarter results, I'd like to begin by sharing an update on our business in Russia and Ukraine.\nAs a company that puts people first in every decision, I'm incredibly proud that we have made the safety and well-being of all those impacted by the tragedy in Ukraine as the top priority. I want to personally thank our many dedicated team members and franchisees working hard to navigate through this deadly conflict and manage our business in the most complex and challenging geopolitical environment in recent history. I'm proud of how our people in the surrounding regions have banded together and are doing everything possible to support impacted Ukrainian refugees, team members and franchisees, some of whom have overcome incredible challenges and have reopened a number of stores to serve food in communities where it is safe.\nAdditionally, the Yum! Brands Foundation made a donation to the Red Cross to support those affected by the crisis. We activated the Yum! Disaster Relief Fund to support Ukrainian franchise employees and are matching employee donations to organizations providing relief in Ukraine, including UNICEF, the Red Cross, the World Food Programme and the International Rescue Committee.\nWe previously announced the suspension of all investment and restaurant development efforts in Russia as well as operations of company-owned KFC restaurants and that we are finalizing an agreement with our Pizza Hut master franchisee to suspend all restaurant operations. In addition to these actions, we have begun a process aimed at transferring ownership to local operators while, in the interim, we continue to redirect any profits from Russia operations to humanitarian aid. This is not a decision we take lightly, and I know that it will be a complicated process to execute these transactions. We will update you on this process during our second quarter earnings call. Chris will provide more details around the financial impact from Russia on the quarter.\nI'll now discuss our first quarter results, which illustrate the resiliency of our highly franchised diversified growth model. Our first quarter system sales growth of 8%, driven by both unit development and same-store sales growth, is a testament to our iconic brands and the unmatched operating capabilities of our world-class franchise partners. We set a first quarter development record, opening nearly 1,000 gross units, supported by positive unit growth at each of our brands. Our continued same-store sales momentum was fueled by our brands executing our Recipe for Growth strategy by providing relevant value, access via new channels, distinctive products and a strong brand voice, all supported by our digital and delivery capabilities.\nOur digital channels continue to accelerate with digital sales of approximately $6 billion, a new first quarter record, reflecting an increase of 15% year-over-year. Importantly, we set a new digital mix record, now exceeding 40%. In this complex and highly inflationary operating environment, we and our franchisees remain focused on maintaining long-term profitability by leveraging our scale and strategic pricing actions while still offering our customers convenience and value. The many competitive advantages of our unrivaled talent, our sophisticated franchise system and the power of our business model give me great confidence that we are well prepared to navigate these complexities and deliver robust global growth.\nLet me share a few global trends from the quarter. As Yum China shared on its first quarter earnings call last night, COVID-related lockdowns impacted restaurant operations and depressed sales in that market, temporarily delaying an eventual recovery. However, our results outside of China remains strong. In fact, excluding China, both our KFC Division and Pizza Hut International same-store sales were up 10%, which would result in consolidated Yum! same-store sales excluding China of 6% for the quarter.\nWe're pleased with the continued momentum in our developed markets as they lap strong results from last year, and we're excited about the continued resurgence of emerging markets, with same-store sales excluding China of positive 18% for the quarter. We continue to be encouraged by the global consumer recovery underpinned by returning consumer mobility, creating a tailwind for our on-premise dining while we sustain our off-premise business.\nNext, I'll discuss 2 of the 4 Recipe for Growth drivers: Our Relevant, Easy and Distinctive brands or RED for short; and our Unrivaled Culture and Talent. Then I'll discuss the progress we've made on our Recipe for Good.\nTurning to our first growth pillar: our Relevant, Easy and Distinctive brands. Starting with the KFC Division, which represents 51% of our operating profit. First quarter system sales grew 9%, driven by 8% unit growth and 3% same-store sales growth.\nTo illustrate the strength of the KFC brand around the world, I thought I'd highlight a few markets that showed meaningful improvement in the quarter, specifically the Middle East, Latin America and Africa. Our Middle East market delivered 40% system sales growth, fueled by robust transaction growth. Our marketing teams led with a healthy balance of new products with the launch of the Messy Burger as well as innovative value-focused flavory items such as the Twister Blaze. These items drove both value perception and new customer acquisition. Additionally, the team's focus on meeting the needs of our customers through digital and off-premise channel growth while the dine-in business bounces back fueled our strong results.\nLatin America is another standout market. This quarter, system sales grew 34%, thanks to our team hitting on all fronts. All countries in the market deployed a balanced marketing calendar focused on value to drive velocity and transaction while taste campaigns continued to build brand strength. This came to life for consumers in January with the Genius Menu value ladder that's helping recover the individual occasion. In March, the Latin American market launched the Kentucky Fried Chicken sandwich for the first time, which drove over 10% growth in the sandwich category.\nAnother market worth highlighting is our Africa business, which has been incredibly resilient as system sales grew 25%. Results were fueled by a continued traffic recovery, leading to transaction growth ahead of pre-COVID levels, a sign our value-driven strategy that offers successful price points resonated well with customers.\nFinally, in the U.S., our KFC team is working hard to maximize convenience for the customer and focusing marketing efforts on creating greater awareness of our off-premise channels, including Quick Pick-up services and our white label delivery offering. The incremental sales layers we've built over the past 2 years, including our digital ordering channels and the chicken sandwich platform, contributed to top line growth this quarter in the face of a difficult operating environment. Additionally, we offered Beyond Fried Chicken in the quarter, which elevated the brand and boosted relevance, resulting in more media impressions than any other product launch in the brand's history. A consistent theme across each of these 4 markets is the continued growth of digital transaction and the ability to execute an omnichannel strategy.\nMoving to the Taco Bell Division, which represents 32% of our operating profit. First quarter system sales grew 8%, driven by 5% unit growth and 5% same-store sales growth. Taco Bell U.S. system sales grew 7%, driven by 2% unit growth and 5% same-store sales growth.\nI thought I'd start by celebrating Taco Bell's 60th anniversary as a brand. Given the brand's role as a culture leader in the industry, it's easy to forget its experience and heritage, all of which makes us even more confident in the brand's ability to navigate any economic environment. Taco Bell is executing on its strategy to inspire and enable the world to live más by remaining relevant, easy and distinctive to its customers.\nOn the relevance front, Taco Bell continued to champion customer value with new offerings to meet all occasions, including the introduction of $2 burritos on the new Cravings Value Menu, adding to Taco Bell's existing $1 menu offering. The combination of Taco Bell's new Cravings Value Menu with its box and combo offerings positions Taco Bell well to serve the needs of all customers.\nBeyond value, Taco Bell was actively marketing craveable distinctive foods, from its limited-time crispy chicken wings to the return of our fan favorite Nacho Fries. Additionally, the return to the Super Bowl with Doja Cat marked the distinctive cultural moment in the quarter. We're building on this cultural moment with a long anticipated and much celebrated upcoming return of the Mexican Pizza, which Doja Cat announced in April.\nTaco Bell International system sales grew 37%, driven by 26% unit growth and 12% same-store sales growth. We continue to build brand momentum in multiple markets, including the U.K., Spain and India. Our new strategy to reach scale in a few key markets has driven brand awareness, thereby improving new unit returns that lead to accelerated growth.\nNext, the Pizza Hut Division, which accounts for 18% of our operating profit, saw first quarter system sales grow 3%, driven by 5% unit growth and flat same-store sales growth.\nAt Pizza Hut International, which represents 11% of our operating profit, system sales grew 10%, underpinned by 7% unit growth and 5% same-store sales growth. We opened 283 gross units, setting a Q1 record. With further easing in COVID restrictions, we saw strong contributions from India and Latin America, where system sales were up 44% and 18%, respectively.\nAt Pizza Hut U.S., which represents 7% of our operating profit, system sales declined 6% for the quarter, attributable to a 6% decline in same-store sales and flat unit growth. While consumer demand remains strong, sales softness in the quarter stems from our delivery channel where capacity constraints limited our ability to meet demand. This was driven by staffing challenges, mainly from delivery driver shortages that have been felt across the industry. The team is prioritizing restaurant operations, including a focus on improving staffing levels, restoring operating hours, increasing online ordering availability and more effectively leveraging the use of our overflow call centers.\nAdditionally, in early Q2, we completed the integration of delivery as a service into our point-of-sale system. This is leading to accelerated system adoption, allowing us to leverage third-party aggregators to augment our own delivery drivers. Another action item we're taking is expanding customer access to the Pizza Hut brand via aggregator marketplace. We are excited about the potential incremental growth from aggregator marketplaces based on outperformance we're seeing from existing franchisees using this channel.\nLastly, at The Habit Burger Grill, first quarter system sales grew 17%, driven by 13% unit growth and 3% same-store sales growth. To streamline restaurant operations for team members this quarter, we promoted operationally easy to execute customer favorites such as our Patty Melt and the Santa Barbara Charburger. We continued to lean into digital-only promotions and saw a strong response to our delivery and app-only campaigns in the quarter that ultimately drove an increase in app downloads and active app users. Even as consumer mobility improved in the first quarter, our digital sales across multiple channels increased sequentially, continuing to demonstrate the stickiness of these ordering options.\nMoving on to our Unrivaled Culture and Talent growth driver. We kicked off the celebration of our 25th year as a publicly traded company with several powerful forums that galvanized our top talent around engagement and development. For the first time in 5 years, we brought our top 250 leaders from around the world together for our Global Leadership Summit. Our technology leaders at the summit made up the largest functional group, which speaks to the investments we've made in differentiated technology capabilities and growth-oriented functions. We also showcased the progress our brands have made putting our Recipe for Good priorities at the center of our future growth, not only with less carbon and less packaging and waste but also by making equity and inclusion come alive across every aspect of our business, from our talent to our brand marketing to our suppliers and franchisees.\nAdditionally, we were proud to take many of our aspiring leaders to the Women's Foodservice Forum, where our Chief Operating Officer and Chief People Office, Tracy Skeans, serves as chair. It was wonderful to see Yum! so prominently represented in a forum dedicated to growing women in our industry, something truly important to us as we're increasing the number of women in senior leadership globally and are on track to achieve gender parity in leadership by 2025. Finally, a group of our diverse leaders gathered in Washington, D.C. to discuss how we inspire and advance equity, inclusion and belonging across all levels of our organization.\nWhen it comes to our Recipe for Good, we invest in critical work that's focused on our 3 priority areas of people, food and planet. Just last month and as part of our larger climate strategy, Yum! joined the Supplier Leadership on Climate Transition global consortium, which was created to accelerate climate action throughout supply chain. Our climate work has started to take shape in markets such as KFC U.K., where they have partnered with the University of Liverpool to develop a road map to achieve net zero carbon and zero waste.\nTo wrap up, this continues to be an incredibly challenging operating environment but my confidence in our future remains high given the resilience of our iconic brands across our global diversified portfolio. Our unmatched global scale provides us unique competitive advantages, including our sophisticated supply chains with cross-brand purchasing power, strong marketing and consumer insights, expanding digital and technology capabilities and our capable, committed and well-capitalized franchisees that are willing to invest in the long-term growth of the business. This quarter's results continue to demonstrate the power and sustainability of our business model while we continue to deliver lasting value for our stakeholders for years to come.\nWith that, Chris, over to you.\n\nChristopher Lee Turner\n\nCFO, Yum! Brands, Inc.\n\nThank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our financial results, our Bold Restaurant Development and Unmatched Operating Capability growth drivers, and our solid balance sheet and liquidity position.\nI'll start by discussing our financial results. Our first quarter system sales grew 8%, driven by 6% unit growth and 3% same-store sales growth, reflecting our continued global momentum. During the quarter, we opened 997 gross units, a Q1 record for Yum!. Core operating profit decreased 5% for the quarter, including a negative impact from Russia of 1%. Ex special, general and administrative expenses were $252 million, tracking in line with our expectations for $1.1 billion of G&A expense for fiscal 2022 and a return to our normal quarterly cadence. Despite inflationary headwinds, we maintained company-owned restaurant margins of approximately 22% at Taco Bell, in line with Q1 2019 pre-COVID margins. Finally, EPS excluding special items was $1.05, representing a 1% decrease year-over-year.\nNext, I'll address the impact to our first quarter results from the Russia conflict in Ukraine. We previously announced the suspension of all investments and restaurant development efforts in Russia as well as operations of company-owned KFC restaurants and that we are finalizing an agreement with our Pizza Hut master franchisee to suspend all restaurant operations in that brand. In addition to these actions, we pledged to redirect profits from operations in Russia to humanitarian aid.\nOur core operating profits in Russia declined versus the first quarter of last year, negatively impacting our Yum! core operating profit growth by 1 percentage point. Finally, as David previously shared, we have begun a process aimed at transferring ownership to local operators. We will plan to provide additional updates on the process on our next earnings call.\nGiven the rapidly evolving operating environment, we wanted to provide our latest thoughts on full year results and the shape of the year. We remain confident in the strength of our business and our ability to achieve our long-term growth algorithm in future years. In 2022, the underlying momentum of the business gives us confidence that we can still deliver on the same-store sales, unit growth and system sales aspects of our long-term growth algorithm. Were it not for the loss of Russia profits, we would deliver on all elements of our long-term growth algorithm in 2022.\nHowever, losing 3% of full year core operating profit from the exclusion of Russia profits puts us outside of our high single-digit core operating profit range this year, with our current forecast closer to mid-single-digit core operating profit growth. With strength in many key markets, continued emerging market recovery and strong development momentum, our teams will continue to strive to overdeliver against our current forecast. We'll keep you updated as the year progresses.\nAs a reminder, given the shape of our anticipated G&A spend in 2022 in comparison to 2021, we expect our G&A expense to remain a headwind to Q2 core operating profit growth and a tailwind to second half core operating profit growth. Additionally, we expect continued softness in China and a full quarter impact from the exclusion of Russia profits. Therefore, we now expect Q2 core operating profit trends to be similar to Q1, and we remain on track with our prior expectations for high-teens core operating profit growth in the second half of the year.\nWhile our system sales and operating profit results shared during today's call excluded the impact of foreign currency, we wanted to provide a brief update on the impact in the quarter and the anticipated impact on both our second quarter and full year results. For Q1, our reported operating profit was unfavorably impacted by $14 million due to foreign currency translation. Based on current exchange rates, we expect FX to reduce second quarter reported operating profit by approximately $12 million to $14 million and reflect a headwind to full year reported operating profit of approximately $30 million to $45 million. This is directional guidance as rates will likely change as we move through the year.\nMoving on to our Bold Restaurant Development growth driver. I'm excited to share that we had another quarter with each of our brands reporting strong positive unit growth. During the quarter, we opened 997 gross units, resulting in 628 net new units, a Q1 development record for Yum!, contributing to 6% unit growth over the last 12 months. We wouldn't be able to achieve these record-breaking results without broad-based contributions from multiple markets across each of our brands.\nIn fact, we had over 500 gross units and 261 net new units opened outside of China, contributing to 5% unit growth in the rest of world year-over-year. Both KFC Division and Pizza Hut International delivered another exceptional development quarter with 587 and 283 gross units opened, respectively. While Yum China continues to be our lead developer, there were significant contributions from each of these brands in India, Asia, the Middle East and Latin America. Taco Bell remains on track for another record development year with growth in next-gen assets in the U.S. and additional markets reaching scale internationally.\nOn that front, we're excited to share that Yum China has committed to expanding the Taco Bell brand, which will allow even more people to live más as we build our brand identity globally and grow our footprint in that market. To that end, we now expect to have 3 more markets to cross the critically important scale threshold of 100 units by the end of 2022, joining Spain, which reached that milestone in 2021.\nThe global development landscape is increasingly complex. But the sophistication, scale and capabilities of our teams and franchisees provide competitive advantages that allowed us to deliver yet another quarter of record unit openings. The visibility into our development pipeline remains strong.\nNow I'll discuss our Unmatched Operating Capability and the 3 key elements we're leaning into: Easy Experiences, Easy Operations and Easy Insights. Before I provide an update across our Easy pillars, I want to comment briefly on our global supply chain. Our supply chain teams continued doing an amazing job building supply chain contingencies and acting as needed to secure product availability, including restaurant equipment, which is necessary for new store openings. Additionally, I'm proud of how our sourcing teams are leveraging our scale and cross-brand purchasing power to help our franchisees and equity stores manage costs in this highly inflationary environment as an important lever in maintaining long-term profitability. This scale combined with our operating experience and learnings from exposure to over 155 markets around the world create a unique competitive advantage for us as we navigate these inflationary pressures.\nStarting with Easy Experiences. With continued reopening trends in markets around the globe, a frictionless experience remains front and center for the consumer. With that in mind, we are constantly adding new convenient ways for our customers to access our brands.\nKFC U.S. and The Habit Burger Grill have made digital ordering even easier. Customers can now order via the app and pick up their food from a specific cubby or shelf within the restaurant. This enables a quicker and more seamless experience that eliminates the need to wait in line at the counter or in the drive-thru. Quick Pick-up is fully deployed across the KFC U.S. system, and roughly 1/3 Of the Habit stores currently have dedicated pickup shelves, with plans to expand more broadly in the coming months.\nIn addition, Taco Bell U.S. recently launched a similar program in their equity stores and will continue to deploy it across their systems more broadly in the coming quarters. Both delivery and early tests of Quick Pick-up continue to free up drive-thru capacity for the Taco Bell system, which helped fuel their ninth consecutive quarter of average drive-thru times under 4 minutes, with a sequential improvement from their fourth quarter drive-thru speed. Internationally, we have exciting projects in early stages, including our KFC Australia business, which is piloting a drone delivery program that gets our finger-licking good products to our customers' home or office in less than 15 minutes on average from when it's ordered.\nNext, I'll move on to Easy Operations, in which we are focused on streamlining operations for our team members and franchisees. We are installing a new kitchen display system and smart hub and leveraging our cloud-based point-of-sale system in our Taco Bell locations with the goal of modernizing the employee experience and providing more digital capabilities within our restaurants. These systems separate out delivery orders from standard drive-thru orders, allowing for improved visibility and execution in the restaurant by our team members. At KFC U.S., we're improving back-of-house operations by expanding our Mobile Manager, a back-of-house suite of applications which simplifies ordering, inventory management and digital order fulfillment, enabling our team members to spend more time focusing on the customer experience.\nPizza Hut continues to make progress putting technology in the hands of its team members through continued global expansion of Dragontail, HutBot and the 360 Coach platforms. Given the driver staffing challenges we're experiencing in the Pizza Hut U.S. business, we're piloting the Dragontail platform in over 100 of our U.S. stores to improve the efficiency of our delivery network. We're excited by the early results, and the platform is working as we hoped given the outstanding performance we've seen in other markets around the world. We're in conversations with our franchisees to expand this cutting-edge platform across the U.S. system.\nThird, I'll discuss Easy Insights, in which we focus on using data and analytics to drive more effective marketing and leverage our insights to enhance the customer and team member experience. At Taco Bell U.S., we continue to experiment with new and innovative ways to engage with our consumers through LTO programs such as the Taco Lover's Pass, which helped fuel growth in loyalty memberships during the quarter and which drove customer frequency.\nKvantum continues to scale its media mix marketing tool, which was recently used in several Pizza Hut International markets to drive incremental sales with a more efficient use of marketing spend. Additionally, we continue to build targeted artificial intelligence and machine learning-based tools, including an exciting new pricing tool that is being piloted in select international markets.\nNext, I'll provide an update on our strong balance sheet and liquidity position. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $365 million excluding restricted cash. On April 1, we called our $600 million 7.75% YBI bonds due in 2025. The repayment was funded by the issuance of a new $1 billion 5.375% YBI bond due in 2032. We were especially pleased with the strong demand and execution in light of the rate environment and volatility in the financial markets. With the recent bond offering, which closed subsequent to the quarter, our consolidated net leverage is roughly in line with our target of 5x. Our capital priorities remain unchanged: invest in the business, maintain a healthy balance sheet, pay a competitive dividend and return the remaining excess cash to shareholders via share repurchases.\nCapital expenditures, net of refranchising proceeds, during the quarter were $18 million. We continue to expect net capital expenditures of approximately $250 million for the full year, reflecting roughly $100 million in refranchising proceeds and up to $350 million of gross CapEx. With respect to our share buyback program, during the quarter, we repurchased 3.4 million shares at an average share price of $121 per share, totaling approximately $407 million.\nIn closing, I'm pleased with the results of the quarter. We opened a record number of units for the first quarter, driving impressive system sales growth. We remain committed to advancing our digital and technology capabilities, leading to enhancements in both the team member and customer experience. And I'm confident in our team's and franchisees' ability to win in a dynamic and complex global landscape.\nWith that, operator, we are ready to take any questions."

Throughout this presentation, unless otherwise indicated, our references to sales growth are year-over-year on a constant currency basis and exclude results from recently acquired businesses for the 12 months following each acquisition.\nThis presentation will include prepared remarks from Anders Gustafsson, our Chief Executive Officer; and Nathan Winters, our Chief Financial Officer. Anders will begin with our fourth quarter and full year 2021 results. Then Nathan will provide additional detail on financials and discuss our 2022 outlook. Anders will conclude with progress made on advancing our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision along with an updated view of our served market opportunity and revised long-term sales outlook. Following the prepared remarks, Joe Heel, our Chief Revenue Officer, will join us as we take your questions. Now let's turn to Slide 4 as I hand it over to Anders.\n\nAnders Gustafsson\n\nCEO & Director, Zebra Technologies Corporation\n\nThank you, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Our team delivered solid fourth quarter results in an exceptionally challenging supply chain environment. For the quarter, we realized adjusted net sales growth of 12% or 10% on an organic basis. Adjusted EBITDA of $319 million, a 4% year-over-year increase and adjusted EBITDA margin of 21.7%, a 180 basis point decrease. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $4.54, a 2% increase from the prior year and strong free cash flow. Customer demand is stronger than ever for our solutions that digitize and automate workflows. We realized sales growth across all 4 regions, supported by exceptional strength in mobile computing, with particularly strong growth in Asia Pacific and Latin America. Supply chain constraints limited us from fully satisfying our customer demand, particularly for certain data capture and printing offerings.\nOur teams have been aggressively working to mitigate the impact of the unprecedented industry-wide supply chain challenges by securing new sources of supply, utilizing alternative modalities of transportation and expediting customer shipments. Premium freight costs exceeded our expectations and significantly weighed on gross margin which was partially offset by higher service and software margin. We also scaled operating expenses while continuing to invest in initiatives to drive sustainable, profitable growth. Our solid fourth quarter performance closed an outstanding full year 2021 in which we generated record sales, EBITDA margin, earnings per share and free cash flow.\nWith that, I will now turn the call over to Nathan to review our Q4 financial results in more detail and discuss our 2022 outlook.\n\nNathan Andrew Winters\n\nCFO, Zebra Technologies Corporation\n\nThank you, Anders. Let's start with the P&L on Slide 6. In Q4, adjusted net sales increased 11.7%, including the impact of currency acquisitions and 10% on an organic basis, reflecting broad-based demand for our solutions. Our Asset Intelligence and Tracking segment, including printing and supplies grew 3.1% despite significant supply constraints on our printer products and cycling very strong prior year results. Enterprise Visibility & Mobility segment sales increased 13.2%, driven by exceptional growth in mobile computing. We continue to drive solid growth across services and software with strong service attach rates and expansion of our software offerings. We recognized solid growth in all 4 regions. North America sales increased 4% with strength in mobile computing, supplies and services. EMEA sales increased 9%, driven by strong growth in mobile computing. Asia Pacific sales grew 29% with strength across all major geographies, including China.\nAnd in Latin America, sales increased 42%, continuing strong double-digit growth in all major offerings. Adjusted gross margin declined 210 basis points to 45.7% due to unprecedented premium fee costs partially offset by higher service and software margins. We will discuss transitory costs, including premium freight further in a moment. Adjusted operating expenses as a percentage of sales improved 40 basis points as we scaled our cost structure while continuing to prioritize high-return investment opportunities in the business. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 21.7%, a 180 basis point decrease from the prior year period, entirely attributable to lower gross margin from transitory impacts, partially offset by operating expense leverage.\nWe drove non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $4.54 and $0.08 or 1.8% year-over-year increase, which also reflects lower interest expense and a slightly higher tax rate. Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow highlights on Slide 7. In 2021, we generated more than $1 billion of free cash flow for the first time in our history. This was $115 million higher than the prior year, primarily due to increased profitable growth. Our balance sheet remains strong. From a debt leverage perspective, we ended the year at a modest 0.5x net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio, which provides us ample flexibility. In 2021, we we invested $452 million to acquire Antuit, Fetch Robotics and Adaptive Vision to advance our solutions offerings in retail, manufacturing and the warehouse. In addition, we made $34 million of venture investments in 5 portfolio companies, $59 million of capital expenditures, $257 million of net debt repayments and $57 million of share repurchases.\nOn Slide 8, we show the multiyear impact of transitory costs primarily related to expedited freight due to supply chain bottlenecks caused by the pandemic as well as tariffs on China imports. Our team is making heroic efforts to satisfy customer demand. This includes dedicating substantial engineering resources to product redesigns, negotiating long-term supply agreements with new and existing suppliers, shifting virtually all transport to air promotion and expediting component parts and finished goods to meet customer commitments. Global freight rates have reached record high cost per kilo for all modalities of delivery across our supply chain. In Q4 compared to pre-pandemic rates, we incurred incremental premium freight costs of $67 million, which is higher than we had anticipated in our prior outlook and $58 million higher than the prior year. Partially offsetting this impact were $4 million of refunds of China import tariffs, which was $8 million less than we received in the fourth quarter of 2020.\nIn total, these transitory items had a combined unfavorable gross margin impact of $66 million year-over-year. I will discuss our assumptions regarding the 2022 impact of transitory costs in a moment. Let's now turn to our outlook. We entered the year with a strong order backlog and healthy sales pipeline supported by broad-based demand for our solutions. Our expected sales growth of 1% to 3% for the first quarter has been capped by what we can deliver to our customers due to extended lead times and limited availability of component parts. Our outlook assumes an approximately 1 percentage point additive impact from acquisitions and foreign currency changes.\nWe anticipate Q1 adjusted EBITDA margin to be approximately 20%, which assumes gross margin contraction from the prior year due to unfavorable sales mix and expected premium freight costs of $60 million, which translates to 340 basis point unfavorable impact to the prior year period. We also expect increased operating expenses as a percent of sales primarily due to our entry into expansion markets since last spring and resuming in-person events. We believe total supply chain impacts, including transitory costs and product availability are peaking in Q1, with recent improvements in freight capacity and better visibility and supplier commitments to component supply into the second quarter. Non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $3.70 to $4. For the full year 2022, we expect adjusted net sales to grow between 3% and 7% with the assumption that supply chain constraints steadily abate throughout the year. This outlook assumes a net neutral impact from acquisitions and foreign currency changes.\nWe anticipate full year 2022 adjusted EBITDA margin between 23% and 24%, which assumes total transitory cost impacts, including premium freight expenses of approximately $140 million to $160 million. This is slightly higher than the impact we realized in 2021. We expect our free cash flow to be at least $900 million for the year. Please reference additional modeling assumptions shown on Slide 9.\nWith that, I will turn the call back to Anders to discuss how we are advancing our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision and to provide an update on our served market opportunity and long-term growth expectations.\n\nAnders Gustafsson\n\nCEO & Director, Zebra Technologies Corporation\n\nThank you, Nathan. I am encouraged by the strong demand across our business and the bold actions our teams are taking to navigate the supply chain challenges. Slide 11 illustrates how we digitize and automate the front line of business by leveraging our industry-leading portfolio of products, software and services. By transforming workflows with our proven solutions that generate an attractive return on investment, Zebra's customers can effectively address their operational challenges, which have become increasingly complex through the pandemic. Our innovative solutions empower the workforce to do their jobs more efficiently by navigating constant change in near real time, utilizing insights driven by advanced software capabilities such as Prescriptive Analytics, intelligent automation and machine vision. We are raising our long-term organic sales growth expectations to 5% to 7% from our former expectation of 4% to 5%.\nOn Slide 12, we provide a refreshed view of our served markets totaling approximately $30 billion, which are supported by mega trends, including the on-demand economy, asset visibility, mobility and cloud computing and automation. These trends have become increasingly important to our enterprise customers, and we remain well positioned to meet their needs with our comprehensive solutions. Today, the vast majority of Zebra sales are in our core, which remains vibrant and is now expected to grow 4% to 5%. We have the broadest and deepest offering among the competition and believe that our continued focus and investment will advance our leadership position. Our near adjacencies provide ample opportunity to expand and have a generally higher growth profile than our core.\nThe most promising categories include RFID solutions for use cases that demand the highest level of workforce productivity and inventory accuracy. Smart supplies, including dynamic temperature as well as the opportunity to equip a broader set of frontline workers with our expanded offering of mobile computers. Beyond our core and near adjacencies are rapid growth expansion opportunities that are transforming workflows across the supply chain. We have entered these areas through organic and inorganic investments over the past 18 months, and they represent a low to mid-single-digit percentage of Zebra sales. In mid-2021, we launched several fixed industrial scanning and machine vision smart cameras.\nWe also acquired Fetch Robotics to give us the broadest portfolio of autonomous mobile robots in the industry. We are also building a compelling software suite that optimizes retail execution and demand planning, which includes Reflexis workforce and task management, Zebra Prescriptive Analytics, Workforce Connect, smart count and antuit.ai powered demand forecasting. Collectively, we are serving an approximately $6 billion market in these exciting expansion areas. We are early on our journey and have the opportunity to extend our capabilities deeper into the areas of machine vision, warehouse automation and workflow optimization software over time.\nNow turning to Slide 13. Businesses partner with Zebra to help optimize their end-to-end workflows as they strive to meet the increasing demands of consumers. I would like to highlight several recent key wins across our end markets. A global apparel retailer is deploying a Zebra solution of 32,000 TC52 mobile computers along with Workforce Connect voice collaboration software and our software solution that transforms mobile computers into workstations on demand. We are enabling this retailer to improve associate productivity and communication in both front of store and distribution center applications, eliminating the need for and full desktop computer workstations. Our mobile computers will also provide the benefit of stable network connectivity, improved security features and battery management tools.\nThis competitive takeaway win and a major consumer device provider demonstrates our superior value proposition versus the competition. Another recent win, Zebra's Reflexis workforce management solution has enabled a U.S.-based specialty retailer to optimize scheduling for more than 25,000 employees and provide enhanced self-service reporting and analytics to support accountability and performance. We have expanded our relationship with a leading international energy company to empower thousands of convenience store associates in the United Kingdom with Workforce Connect and Reflexis workforce management applications on their Zebra mobile computers and tablets. Our solution enables the store associates to automate their daily responsibilities, maximizing productivity and streamlining task management and administration.\nWe have expanded our relationship with a European auto manufacturer, augmenting thousands of their Zebra mobile computers with RFID readers to enhance quality control in production lines and allow secure employee system access. We continue to collaborate with this customer to pilot promising new solutions to further optimize their operations. In health care, a large hospital system in the Southern United States purchased TC52 mobile computers and our Workforce Connect software application to enable mobile access to the medical record systems as well as facilitate instant communication between nurses and other clinicians.\nZebra has competing consumer device providers because of our reputation for comprehensive enterprise solutions. In closing, we are working diligently to navigate through industry-wide supply chain challenges, which limit our ability to fully satisfy strong customer demand in the near term. That said, the pandemic has accelerated trends that have been driving growth in Zebra's vibrant markets, including e-commerce adopt, the need for real-time track and trace across the supply chain and the shift to a more digital health care experience. We continue to be very excited about our growth prospects. Now I'll hand the call back over to Mike.\n\nMichael A. Steele\n\nVP of IR, Zebra Technologies Corporation\n\nThanks, Anders. We'll now open the call to Q&A. We ask that you limit yourself to 1 question and 1 follow-up so that we can get to as many of you as possible."

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded.\nAnd I would now like to turn the conference over to Mike Steele, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nMichael A. Steele\n\nVice President-Investor Relations, Zebra Technologies Corp.\n\nGood morning, and welcome to Zebra's third quarter conference call. This presentation is being simulcast on our website at investors.zebra.com and will be archived there for at least 1 year. Our forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially, and we refer you to the factors discussed in our SEC filings. During this call, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures as we describe our business performance. You can find reconciliations at the end of the slide presentation and in today's earnings press release.\nThroughout this presentation, unless otherwise indicated, our references to sales performance are year-over-year on a constant currency basis and exclude results from recently acquired businesses for the 12 months following each acquisition. This presentation will include prepared remarks from Bill Burns, our Chief Executive Officer; and Nathan Winters, our Chief Financial Officer. Bill will begin with our third quarter results and actions we are taking. Nathan will then provide additional detail on the financials and discuss our Q4 outlook. Bill will conclude with progress we are making on advancing our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision. Following the prepared remarks, Joe Heel, our Chief Revenue Officer, will join us as we take your questions.\nNow let's turn to Slide 4 as I hand it over to Bill.\n\nWilliam J. Burns\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cross Country Healthcare, Inc.\n\nThank you, Mike. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. As expected, our third quarter performance was impacted by broad-based softness across our end markets and elongated sales cycles. This resulted in a significant decline in sales with expense deleveraging impacting profitability. We will spend time today discussing our results, and the demand environment as well as the progress we have made to rationalize our cost structure and shift our go-to-market resources to drive sales growth and improve profitability as our end markets recover. For the quarter, we realized sales of $956 million, a 30% decline from the prior year and adjusted EBITDA margin of 11.6% and a 950 basis point decrease and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.87, a 79% decrease from the prior year. We saw broad-based softening of demand in late Q2, which continued throughout Q3 as customers demonstrated more cautious spending behavior across all our end markets and regions. These dynamics have been exacerbated by our distributors reducing their inventory levels, which accounted for about 1/3 of our Q3 sales decline. As a reminder, our distribution channel has been aggressively driving down inventory as end-user demand has slowed, product lead times have recovered and cost of holding working capital has increased. We believe this reset will largely complete by year-end. Although we experienced declines across all product categories, services and software were bright spots in the quarter.\nAs we enter Q4, potentially all the cost restructuring actions now implemented, we expect to see a significant sequential improvement in profitability. These actions are now expected to yield net annualized cost savings of $100 million, which is an increase from our previous expectation of $85 million.\nOn Slide 5, we summarize drivers of demand trends across our end markets. Our 3 largest end markets, representing more than 3/4 of our sales volume, are indexed to the goods economy, which has been significantly underperforming the services economy. While each of our primary end markets declined, demand was weakest in retail and e-commerce and transportation logistics as many customers are navigating a challenging environment and absorbing capacity built out during the pandemic. As you see on the slide, despite current demand softness, there are several themes that we expect to drive investment in our solutions over the long term, including labor and resource constraints, real-time supply chain visibility, track and trace mandates and increased expectations from shoppers and patients.\nTurning to Slide 6. I'd like to review the actions we are taking to address and mitigate the impacts of the soft demand environment and position ourselves for long-term success. In late Q3 and early Q4, we implemented most of the cost restructuring actions that are driving $100 million of net annualized operating savings. We are reallocating resources to accelerate growth in underpenetrated markets, including Japan, along with government and manufacturing sectors, and to capture the potential of new use cases that leverage our solutions to digitize and automate environments, including RFID and machine vision. We are also renegotiating long-term supply agreements and working with our contract manufacturers to drive down component inventories. And as part of our long-term incentive plan, we added a free cash flow conversion metric. We expect the cost actions we have implemented and the shift of our go-to-market resources to improve profitability and drive sales growth as our end markets recover. While we believe we are seeing a leveling of demand trends and the peak of distributor destocking activity, we are not seeing signs of a market recovery based on customer behavior. Therefore, we remain cautious in our planning through the remainder of this year and the first half of 2024. We'll continue to take an agile approach to managing through this uncertain environment, and we remain disciplined with respect to our cost structure and cash flow.\nI will now turn the call over to Nathan to review our Q3 financial results and discuss our fourth quarter outlook.\n\nNathan Andrew Winters\n\nActing CFO, Zebra Technologies Corporation\n\nThank you, Bill.\nLet's start with the P&L on Slide 8. In Q3, net sales decreased 30.6% and 29.6%, excluding the impact of FX. Our Asset Intelligence and Tracking segment declined 25.8% primarily driven by printing. Enterprise Visibility and Mobility segment sales declined 31.4% and with pronounced weakness in mobile computing. On a positive note, we drove growth across service and software with strong attach and renewal rates. We saw double-digit sales declines across our regions. In North America, sales decreased 25%. EMEA sales declined 39% with broad-based declines across the region. Asia Pacific sales decreased 32% driven by China and Southeast Asia, and Latin America sales decreased 15%, driven by Mexico. Adjusted gross margin decreased 100 basis points to 44.8%, primarily due to expense deleveraging from lower sales volumes, partially offset by favorable premium supply chain costs. As these supply chain costs have been fully mitigated, we are no longer including a slide as part of our earnings presentation. Adjusted operating expenses delevered 910 basis points as a percent of sales. Note that the bulk of the previously announced restructuring plans to drive operating expense savings were implemented in late Q3 and early Q4. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 11.6%, a 950 basis point decrease driven by expense deleveraging. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.87, a 79% year-over-year decrease. Increased interest expense contributed to the decline, offset by a lower tax rate.\nTurning now to the balance sheet and cash flow on Slide 9. For the first 9 months of 2023, negative free cash flow of $193 million was unfavorable to the prior year period, primarily due to lower earnings, including the impact of restructuring actions and higher interest costs. Greater use of net working capital due to higher cash taxes and payments for inventory and $45 million more of previously announced quarterly settlement payments, all of which was partially offset by lower incentive compensation payments. We ended the quarter at 2.2x net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio, which is below the top end of our target range of 2.5x and had approximately $1 billion of capacity on a revolving credit facility providing ample flexibility as we navigate a challenging environment.\nLet's now turn to our outlook. As we enter the fourth quarter, we are seeing sales velocity out of the channel stabilize on a sequential basis and destocking activity moderate as expected. Our Q4 sales are expected to decline between 32% and 36% compared to the prior year. This outlook assumes double-digit declines across our major product categories, with distributor destocking accounting for approximately 1/5 of the sales decline. We are in Q4 with the necessary backlog and pipeline to support our guide. That said, we are not seeing compelling signs of a market recovery as we look to the first half of 2024. We anticipate Q4 adjusted EBITDA margin to be approximately 16%, driven by expense deleveraging from lower sales volumes, partially mitigated by the benefits of our cost restructuring actions. Despite anticipated expense deleveraging, we expect year-on-year gross margin improvement as we cycle $25 million of premium supply chain costs in the prior year period. Non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.40 to $1.80. Our Q4 outlook translates to an expected full year sales decline of approximately 21% at the midpoint, which is 50 basis points favorable to our prior guide and an EBITDA margin of approximately 18%. We expect our free cash flow to be positive for the second half of 2023 and negative for the full year. We continue to be focused on rightsizing inventory on our balance sheet and in driving 100% cash conversion over a cycle. Please reference additional modeling assumptions shown on Slide 10.\nWith that, I will turn the call to Bill to discuss how we are advancing our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision.\n\nWilliam J. Burns\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cross Country Healthcare, Inc.\n\nThank you, Nathan.\nWhile sales are pressured near term, our solutions remain essential to our customers' operations, and we are well positioned to benefit from the secular trends that digitize and automate workflows. We are focused on advancing our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision by elevating Zebra as a premier solutions provider through our compelling portfolio. By transforming workflows with our proven solutions, Zebra's customers can effectively address their complex operational challenges, including scarcity of labor and the need to improve productivity. We empower the workforce to execute tasks more effectively by navigating constant change in near real time, utilizing insights driven by advanced software capabilities such as artificial intelligence, machine learning and prescriptive analytics. We continue to advance and innovate our offerings. This includes several product and solution launches across our portfolio, including our Zebra Pay solution, which equips retail associates hospitality workers and logistics employees with the mobile point-of-sale device that accepts a variety of payment options almost anywhere. At our annual software customer user conference, we unveiled our Zebra work Cloud suite of software solutions, which address 4 critical enterprise functions, workforce optimization, enterprise collaboration, inventory optimization, and demand intelligence. The user experience is tailored to customer-specific business priorities and integrate it into a single application. This unique software suite, coupled with our mobile computing platform, differentiates us and expands our market penetration opportunity.\nIn collaboration with Qualcomm, we demonstrated a generative AI large language model for handheld mobile computers and tablets without requiring connectivity to the cloud. Is the competitive differentiator, which will enable Zebra partners and customers to create new ways of working by further empowering the frontline worker and driving additional productivity gains. We are confident that the innovation road map across our business will continue to elevate our customer value proposition.\nAs you can see on Slide 13, a customers leverage our technology to optimize workflows for the on-demand economy. Our solutions empower enterprises to increase collaboration and productivity and better serve customers, shoppers and patients. I would like to highlight some recent wins by our team. A global technology provider recently selected Zebra's machine vision solution to automate a previously manual inspection process for the manufacturing of engraved component parts. Our solution ensures high quality and traceability, reducing expensive material waste and false errors. We look forward to exploring opportunities to expand our relationship with this customer. A large health care system in Europe is using our mobile computers, printers and RFID solutions to enable real-time tracking of medical equipment, significantly reducing the time caregivers spend searching for critical assets throughout the hospital. A large retail pharmacy chain, selected Zebra's work Cloud task management software to improve store productivity and effectiveness by streamlining communication and accelerating on-site inspections and marketing promotion updates. Optimizing task assignments and store walks drives accountability and frees up staff to focus on customer-facing activities. A large North American retailer refreshed our mobile computers across their stores and added RFID technology to improve inventory accuracy, supply chain efficiency and customer satisfaction the more frequent cycle counts. During the competitive review, Zebra demonstrated the most cost-effective solution for their needs.\nLastly, a large Asian retailer decided to add Zebra's communication and collaboration software to their Zebra mobile computers. This subscription-based solution drives store associated connectivity benefits while displacing the legacy phone system.\nIn closing, our long-term conviction in our business remains unchanged. While customer spend is pressured near term, over the long term, we believe we are well positioned to benefit from secular trends to digitize and automate workflows. We will continue to elevate our position with customers through our innovative portfolio of solutions, while executing on actions to position us well for profitable growth as our end markets recover.\nI will now hand it back to Mike.\n\nMichael A. Steele\n\nVice President-Investor Relations, Zebra Technologies Corp.\n\nThanks, Bill. We'll now open the call to Q&A. We ask that you limit yourself to 1 question and 1 follow-up so that we can get to as many view as possible."

Now let's turn to Slide 4 as I hand it over to Anders.\n\nAnders Gustafsson\n\nCEO & Director, Zebra Technologies Corporation\n\nThank you, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Our team delivered solid second quarter results in a challenging macro environment. For the quarter, we realized sales growth of nearly 7% and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 21.9%, a 170 basis point decrease and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $4.61, a 1% increase from the prior year. Customer demand remains strong for our solutions, which digitize and automate workflows. We realized double-digit sales growth in EMEA, Asia Pacific and Latin America and a slight decline in North America on strong prior year comparisons.\nWe realized growth across all major offerings, including printing, where we recovered nicely from a challenging Q1. Our health care, manufacturing and retail and e-commerce end markets each grew faster than the corporate average. Our team successfully navigated the China COVID lockdowns and our actions to redesign certain products and secure long-term purchase agreements enabled us to generate more supply, particularly for printers. We also scaled adjusted operating expenses to drive profitability while continuing to prudently invest in our growth initiatives.\nOverall, we are pleased that our second quarter sales performance was near the high end of our expectations, and EPS exceeded our guidance range as our team executed well on our efforts to mitigate supply chain challenges. With that, I will now turn the call over to Nathan to review our Q2 financial results in more detail and discuss our revised 2022 outlook.\n\nNathan Andrew Winters\n\nCFO, Zebra Technologies Corporation\n\nThank you, Anders. Let's start with the P&L on Slide 6. In Q2, adjusted net sales increased 6.4%, including the impact of currency and acquisitions and 6.9% on an organic basis as we secured a greater supply of certain products than we had anticipated. Our Asset Intelligence & Tracking segment, including printing and supplies increased 9.7%, driven by a strong recovery in printing as we secured critical components to better satisfy record levels of customer demand.\nEnterprise Visibility & Mobility segment sales increased 5.6%, with solid growth in both data capture and mobile computing solutions. We realized particularly strong growth in RFID solutions as well as ruggedized tablets in Q2. We also continue to drive solid growth across services and software with strong service attach rates and attractive software offerings. We realized strong growth in 3 of our 4 regions. EMEA sales increased 17%, driven by particularly strong growth in mobile computing and printing inclusive of the impact of exiting Russia in March. Asia Pacific sales grew 14%, with particular strength in India.\nLatin America sales increased 16%, with exceptional growth in Mexico. And in North America, sales decreased 2% due to supply constraints. We also cycled particularly strong mobile computing sales volumes in Q2 of last year. Adjusted gross margin declined 200 basis points to 46%, due to higher premium supply chain costs and China import tariff recovery in the prior year period, partially offset by higher service and software margin.\nAdjusted operating expenses as a percent of sales improved 60 basis points. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 21.9%, a 170 basis point decrease from the prior year period. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $4.61, a 0.9% year-over-year increase, helped by lower share count and lower taxes. Note that in the quarter, we entered into a settlement agreement resulting in a $372 million onetime non-GAAP charge, which will be paid out over 8 quarterly installments.\nTurning now to the balance sheet and cash flow highlights on Slide 7. For the first half of 2022, we generated $123 million of free cash flow which was lower than the last year, primarily due to a higher use of working capital as sales volumes shifted to later in the period due to the China lockdowns, higher incentive compensation payments given our exceptional 2021 performance, and the initial $45 million quarterly installment payment related to the settlement I just mentioned.\nFrom a balance sheet perspective, as previously announced, we have significantly increased our available borrowing capacity to align with our growing business to optimize our capital structure. Our new credit facility provides us ample flexibility for organic and inorganic investment, including the recent acquisition of Matrox Imaging as well as share repurchases through our recently announced $1 billion incremental authorization. We made $300 million of share repurchases in Q2 and from a debt leverage perspective, we ended the quarter at a comfortable 1.7x net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio.\nOn Slide 8, we highlight that premium supply chain costs have sequentially improved from peak levels. Our team has been successfully working all avenues, including product redesigns and negotiating long-term supply agreements for critical components, which has enabled us to reduce our purchases in the spot market. We have been seeing steady improvement in the supply chain environment, which we continue to closely monitor.\nIn Q2, we incurred incremental premium supply chain costs of $56 million as compared to the pre-pandemic baseline which was favorable to what we had anticipated in our prior outlook. In total, Q2 transitory items had a combined unfavorable gross margin impact of $35 million year-over-year. And in Q3 are expected to be approximately $45 million, which is a neutral year-on-year impact net of pricing.\nLet's now turn to our outlook. We entered the second half of the year with a strong order backlog and healthy sales pipeline, supported by broad-based demand for our solutions. We have been experiencing a steady improvement in manufacturing output. However, our sales growth continues to be limited by extended lead times and availability of certain component parts. Our organic growth has also been impacted by approximately 1 to 2 points after stopping shipments to Russia in March.\nFor Q3, we are limiting our sales growth to a range of 2% to 4% due to actions to reduce expedited airfreight costs and shift our printer products to ocean shipments, which will improve both Q4 growth and profitability. We are also assuming a 2-point additive impact from recently acquired businesses and a 3-point negative impact from foreign currency translation. As a reminder, approximately 25% of our global sales are denominated in euros.\nWe anticipate Q3 adjusted EBITDA margin to be approximately 22%, which is an increase from both prior year and prior quarter. Non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $4.35 to $4.65. For the full year 2022, we are reaffirming our outlook with a sales growth range between 4% and 6%, inclusive of the impact of exiting Russia. We are also assuming a 150 basis point additive impact from recently acquired businesses and a 225 basis point negative impact from foreign currency translation. We now anticipate full year 2022 adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 22%, the low end of our prior guide, primarily due to the significantly stronger U.S. dollar.\nProfit margins are expected to improve in the second half of the year as we continue to shift to lower-cost freight options and prudently manage operating expenses and investments. We now expect our free cash flow to be at least $650 million for the year, which we have reduced primarily due to the approximately $150 million of settlement-related payments. Please reference additional modeling assumptions shown on Slide 9. With that, I will turn the call back to Anders to discuss how we are advancing our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision.\n\nAnders Gustafsson\n\nCEO & Director, Zebra Technologies Corporation\n\nThank you, Nathan. We are entering the second half of the year in a position of strength as we closely monitor the volatile global macro environment. We have a track record of protecting profitability and cash flow in any environment while preserving investments that drive sustainable, profitable growth. I am encouraged by the continued strong demand we are seeing across our business and the bold actions our teams are taking to mitigate the supply chain impacts.\nSlide 11 illustrates how we digitize and automate the front line of business by leveraging our industry-leading portfolio of products, software and services. By transforming workflows with our proven solutions, Zebra's customers can effectively address their complex operational challenges, which have been magnified since the pandemic. As we have extended our lead in the industry and expanded our portfolio with compelling solutions, we have elevated our strategic position with our customers.\nOur trusted relationships with our 10,000-plus partners across the globe augment our capabilities, enabling us to serve more customers worldwide and we are always excited to engage with partners who drive the value. We are excited about our new global strategic alliance with Accenture, which focuses on solving complex operational challenges in retail and other end markets with Zebra solutions. We are collaborating to advance our customers' strategies to drive productivity, inventory accuracy and customer service levels among a variety of other benefits that can be realized by digitizing and automating workflows throughout the enterprise.\nNow turning to Slide 12. Businesses partner with Zebra to help optimize their end-to-end workflows as they strive to meet the increasing demands of consumers. I would like to highlight several recent key wins across our end markets. The major global transportation and logistics company is expanding its relationship with Zebra across multiple product lines to ensure a more accurate package loading using RFID technology across many sites.\nZebra's RFID printers and scanners are integral to plugging packages loaded into the wrong truck in real time using RFID technology before the vehicle leaves the location. Zebra also supplied more than 3,000 tablets to assist associates in moving trailers around the yard, ensuring the most efficient placement of trucks, trailers and packages.\nA large supermarket operator in Europe will more than double its fleet of Zebra enterprise mobile computers in a multiyear rollout covering warehouse, front and back of store and curbside pickup use cases displacing consumer cellphones. The customer expects improved productivity benefits through better product availability, faster execution on click and collect use cases and real-time price checking as they drive towards the 0 food waste goal. This expansion win results from the exceptional service and trust established over our long-standing relationship and throughout the RFP process.\nIn another recent win, a major U.S. convenience store chain added additional mobile computers in each of its more than 2,000 stores to augment its inventory management and merchandising use cases. This customer has a deep penetration of Zebra solutions, including our printers, mobile computers and scanners to digitize and automate its workflows. Several years ago, this customer had implemented other Zebra solutions in its warehouses and has subsequently selected Zebra for additional use cases as it addressed other business challenges. Additionally, a significant U.S. health care product distributor expanded their use of Zebra solutions, equipping their warehouse staff with wrist and ring scanners to improve efficiency in their pick and pack use cases for their warehouse associates.\nZebra collaborated with the customer and the partner to ensure e-supporting of their applications to the Android operating system. We are also very pleased to be making progress in our most recent expansion markets, fixed industrial scanning, machine vision and autonomous mobile robots. We closed on the purchase of Matrox Imaging in early June, and we joined them at the automated warehouse trade show in Detroit. We are excited to add Matrox Imaging's leading comprehensive portfolio of machine vision solutions along with many specialized channel partners to help us scale our combined business.\nAt automate, we also highlighted our Fetch autonomous mobile robot fulfillment solution which we have been deploying at third-party logistics provider, Rakuten, and we are excited about another recent key win with Maersk, an integrated logistics company. Additionally, Fetch AMR conveyance and material movement solutions, continued strong traction in use cases for health care supply delivery, automotive spare parts, campaigns and waste removal.\nIn closing, our actions have enabled us to begin to recover from industry-wide supply chain challenges, and we continue to be very excited about our growth prospects as we monitor the volatile macro environment. The global labor deficit and supply chain challenges have escalated the need for enterprises to digitize and automate their operations with our solutions. We have the broadest portfolio of tailored solutions to help our customers advance their strategies. Now I will hand the call back over to Mike.\n\nMichael A. Steele\n\nVP of IR, Zebra Technologies Corporation\n\nThanks, Anders. We'll now open the call to Q&A. (Operator Instructions)"

[Operator Instructions] Please note that today's event is being recorded. And at this time, I would now like to turn the conference over to Mike Steele, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nMichael A. Steele\n\nVice President-Investor Relations, Zebra Technologies Corp.\n\nGood morning, and welcome to Zebra's first quarter conference call. This presentation is being simulcast on our website at investors.zebra.com and will be archived there for at least 1 year.\nOur forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially due to factors discussed in our SEC filings. During this call, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures as we describe our business performance. You can find reconciliations at the end of the slide presentation and in today's earnings press release. Throughout this presentation, unless otherwise indicated, our references to sales growth, our year-over-year on a constant currency basis and exclude results from recently acquired businesses for the 12 months following each acquisition.\nThis presentation will include prepared remarks from Bill Burns, our Chief Executive Officer; and Nathan Winters, our Chief Financial Officer. Bill will begin with our first quarter highlights. Then Nathan will provide additional detail on the Q1 results and discuss our revised 2023 outlook. Bill will conclude with progress made on advancing our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision. Following the prepared remarks, Joe Heel, our Chief Revenue Officer, will join us as we take your questions.\nNow let's turn to Slide 4 as I hand it over to Bill.\n\nWilliam J. Burns\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cross Country Healthcare, Inc.\n\nThank you, Mike. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Our team executed well in a challenging macroeconomic environment, delivering first quarter sales and earnings results above the midpoint of our outlook. For the quarter, we realized sales of $1.4 billion approximately in line with the prior year; and adjusted EBITDA margin of 21.4%, a 150 basis point increase; and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.94, a 2% decrease from the prior year. Regional sales performance was mixed with growth in Asia Pac and North America mostly offsetting declines in EMEA and Latin America.\nFrom a solutions perspective, printing, data capture and RFID were bright spots, while sales of mobile computers declined. We continue to see cautious spending behavior by enterprise customers with a decline in large orders and growth in small to midsized orders. From a profitability perspective, improved gross margin drove our EBITDA margin increase. Higher interest and tax expense resulted in a slight earnings decline.\nI would now like to spend a moment on our sales outlook. As the risk of broader softening of industry demand has materialized, we have reduced our full year outlook. Late in Q1 and into Q2, demand trends softened across our end markets, particularly for mobile computers in EMEA and North America as customers' CapEx budgets tightened and IT device spending contracts. We are mitigating the impact of softer sales with targeted go-to-market actions to drive additional demand and incremental cost actions. We will continue to take an agile approach to managing throughout this uncertain near-term environment.\nI will now turn the call over to Nathan to review our Q1 financial results and provide additional details on our revised 2023 outlook.\n\nNathan Andrew Winters\n\nActing CFO, Zebra Technologies Corporation\n\nThank you, Bill. Let's start with the P&L on Slide 6. In Q1, net sales decreased 1.9%, including the impact of currency and acquisitions and were 0.3% lower on an organic basis. Our Asset Intelligence and Tracking segment increased 28.4%, led by strength in printing as we lapped significant supply constraints in the prior year period. Enterprise Visibility & Mobility segment sales declined 11.2% with mixed performance among our offerings. We realized strong growth in data capture solutions and RFID.\nMobile computing sales declined primarily due to large customer order deferrals, slowing demand through distribution and the impact of ceasing sales to Russia in March of 2022. Additionally, we also drove growth across service and software with strong service attach rates. Performance was mixed across our regions. North America sales increased 1% due to strength in printing and data capture helped by the recovery from supply chain challenges. EMEA sales declined 4%, primarily due to a 350 basis point impact of our suspension of sales into Russia. Asia Pacific sales grew 6%, driven by strong mobile computing growth in Japan. And Latin America sales decreased 1%, with relative outperformance in Brazil and Mexico.\nAdjusted gross margin increased 290 basis points to 47.5%, primarily due to lower premium supply chain costs, partially offset by FX and lower service margin. Adjusted operating expenses increased 130 basis points as a percent of sales, primarily due to a return to normalized sales and marketing activity and strategic investments in the business, partially offset by a reduction in G&A expense. First quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 21.4%, a 150 basis point increase driven by gross margin expansion. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $3.94, a 1.7% year-over-year decrease due to increased interest expense and a higher tax rate, partially offset by fewer shares outstanding.\nTurning now to the balance sheet and cash flow on Slide 7. In Q1, we had negative free cash flow of $92 million, which was unfavorable to the prior year period primarily due to the timing of inventory payments, higher interest cost and cash taxes and $45 million of previously announced quarterly settlement payments, which are scheduled to conclude in Q1 of 2024, all of which was partially offset by favorability in the timing of customer collections and lower incentive compensation payments. In Q1, we also made $15 million of share repurchases and invested $1 million in our venture portfolio. We ended the quarter at a comfortable 1.6x net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio, which is well below the top of our target range of 2.5x and had approximately $1.3 billion of capacity on our revolving credit facility.\nOn Slide 8, we highlight premium supply chain costs, which have continued to improve from peak levels. The actions we have taken to redesign products, along with the improving freight rates and capacity have enabled us to reduce component purchases on the spot market and reduce freight cost impact. In Q1, we incurred premium supply chain costs of $15 million as compared to the pre-pandemic baseline, and $53 million lower than the prior year. We are expecting these premium supply chain costs to continue to decline.\nLet's now turn to our outlook. We continue to see enterprise customers defer large orders and are also realizing lower sales into the channel as distributors adjust to softer demand trends as well as our improved product lead times and their higher cost of capital. For the second quarter, our sales are expected to decline between 9% and 11% compared to the prior year. Our outlook assumes a 2-point negative impact from foreign currency changes and a 1 point additive impact from recent acquisitions. We anticipate Q2 adjusted EBITDA margin to be approximately 20%, driven by expense deleveraging from lower sales volume, partially offset by higher expected gross margin from improved supply chain costs. We expect premium supply chain costs to be approximately $15 million in Q2 and more than $40 million year-on-year reduction. Non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $3.20 to $3.40.\nWe are reducing our full year 2023 sales outlook by 3 points. We now anticipate net sales to decline between 2% and 6%. This outlook assumes an approximately 50 basis point net negative impact from foreign currency changes and acquisitions. Second half sales are expected to benefit from easier year-on-year comparisons, our recently announced price increase and abating FX headwinds. We have a solid pipeline of opportunities that gets us to the high end of the sales range, but are embedding caution in our outlook, given recent demand trends in the uncertain macro environment.\nWe expect full year adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 22%, which is the low end of our previous outlook. We now expect premium supply chain costs of approximately $40 million for the year, as we are seeing faster-than-expected supply chain recovery. We have been proactively managing operating expenses through targeted restructuring actions and discretionary cost controls, and we expect sequentially lower operating expenses in the second half of the year.\nWe now expect our free cash flow to be between $450 million and $550 million for the year, which reflects increased caution in our revised full year outlook. As a reminder, cash flow is impacted by increased cash taxes and $180 million of previously announced settlement payments. We continue to be focused on rightsizing elevated inventory on our balance sheet as component lead times have normalized. Working capital variability over the past year has been significantly impacted by global supply chain dynamics. Our fundamental business model is unchanged, and we believe the actions we are taking will enable us to deliver greater than 100% free cash flow conversion as we normalize inventory levels. We are focused on achieving a 100% conversion over a cycle, which is now included in our long-term executive incentive compensation plan. Please reference additional modeling assumptions shown on Slide 9.\nWith that, I will turn the call to Bill to discuss how we are advancing our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision.\n\nWilliam J. Burns\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cross Country Healthcare, Inc.\n\nThank you, Nathan. While customer spend is pressured near term, our solutions are essential to our customers' operations, and we are well positioned to benefit from secular trends to digitize and automate workflows across our served markets. Slide 11 illustrates how we digitize the front line of business by leveraging our industry-leading portfolio of products, software and services. By transforming workflows with our proven solutions, Zebra's customers can effectively address their complex operational challenges, including scarcity of labor and improving productivity in challenging times. We empower the workforce to execute tasks more efficiently by navigating constant change in near real time, utilizing insights driven by advanced software capabilities such as artificial intelligence, machine learning and prescriptive analytics.\nNow turning to Slide 12. We are focused on advancing our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision by continuing to elevate Zebra as a premier solutions provider through our compelling portfolio. In March, at the [ ProMat ] manufacturing and supply chain trade show, Zebra, along with our partners, showcased the depth and breadth of our innovative solutions for manufacturing, logistics and the broader supply chain. Our industrial automation solutions, including autonomous mobile robots, machine vision and fixed industrial scanning, are synergistic with technology-equipped frontline workers. At the show, we featured Zebra solutions at each stage of warehouse operations, including receiving, storage and fulfillment. It demonstrated how we improve key outcomes for our customers, such as enhancing supply chain agility, improving production quality and maximizing utilization and productivity.\nAs you can see on Slide 13, Zebra powers the front line of business across retail and e-commerce, transportation logistics, manufacturing, health care and other markets. Businesses partnered with Zebra to optimize their end-to-end workflows as they strive to meet the increasing demands of customers across a variety of vertical end markets. The business challenges we are solving have expanded through our investment in complementary offerings that enable us to further penetrate customer accounts.\nI would like to highlight several wins across our end markets. We are beginning to deploy the record RFID win we mentioned on our last call. This global transportation logistics provider plans to tag every package that enters their facilities with RFID and coated labels to enhance tracking visibility. Zebra solutions improved productivity, enable faster error detection, driving cost savings and increased customer satisfaction. In addition to our RFID offerings, this customer is also deploying our mobile computers as an integral part of the overall solution.\nA major e-commerce provider in Europe recently expanded their use case of Zebra's fixed industrial scanners at several thousand packing stations. This enables the customer to continue to significantly reduce scan time and increase throughput, particularly for their more complex packing needs. The support and collaboration with Zebra and our partner was a key differentiator among our competition.\nA large Australian supermarket chain has replaced consumer-grade devices with our Zebra [indiscernible] tablets and scanners to enable faster and more accurate buy online, pick up in store and home delivery fulfillment. Zebra's enterprise-grade solution, along with our commitment to sustainability, including our recycling program and eco-friendly packaging, were competitive differentiators in securing this win.\nA Latin American manufacturing company recently selected Zebra mobile computers and mobile printers to help streamline delivery and warehouse operations. Delivery personnel will benefit from synergies between these products, while warehouse employees realize similar efficiencies with Zebra scanners and desktop printers. This manufacturer shows our products for reliability and durability and considers us a strategic partner in their technology journey.\nA regional bank recently selected our workforce management software for all branch locations, displacing a competitor. Our solution is expected to drive cost savings through more efficient scheduling and allocation of people resources. We are pleased about the benefits our solutions are delivering in our customers' mission-critical operations.\nSlide 14 reiterates challenges that have materialized since our last guide. We believe the actions we are taking, which include working closely with our customers as they look to deploy solutions to drive efficiency within their businesses, increasing our focus on accelerating growth in underpenetrated markets and driving incremental cost actions within our business will allow us to exit 2023 stronger, positioning us to deliver profitable growth, increased market share and improved free cash flow.\nIn closing, we are facing near-term headwinds and have taken actions to drive a stronger second half. Our long-term conviction in our business is unchanged. Moving forward, we are focused on driving profitable growth in our core and expansion markets, collaborating closely with our customers and partners to continue to elevate Zebra as a premier solutions provider in attracting, developing and retaining top global talent to drive innovation. I will now hand it back to Mike.\n\nMichael A. Steele\n\nVice President-Investor Relations, Zebra Technologies Corp.\n\nThanks, Bill. We'll now open the call to Q&A. We ask that you limit yourself to 1 question and 1 follow-up so that we can get to as many of you as possible."

This presentation is being simulcast on our website at investors.zebra.com and will be archived there for at least 1 year. Our forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially, and we refer you to the factors discussed in our SEC filings.\nDuring this call, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures as we describe our business performance. You can find reconciliations at the end of this slide presentation and in today's earnings press release. Throughout this presentation, unless otherwise indicated, our references to sales performance are year-over-year and on a constant currency basis.\nThis presentation will include prepared remarks from Bill Burns, our Chief Executive Officer; and Nathan Winters, our Chief Financial Officer. Bill will begin with a discussion of our first quarter results and strategic actions. Nathan will then provide additional detail on the financials and discuss our second quarter and full year outlook. Bill will conclude with progress on advancing our vision. Following the prepared remarks, Bill and Nathan will take your questions. Now let's turn to Slide 4 as I hand it over to Bill.\n\nWilliam J. Burns\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cross Country Healthcare, Inc.\n\nThank you, Mike. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. As expected, our first quarter performance was impacted by continued broad-based softness across our end markets and regions, which we began to experience in the second quarter of last year, resulting in a double-digit decline in sales and profitability. However, we are beginning to see a modest recovery in demand as we saw sequential improvement from the fourth quarter. We are particularly encouraged by the better-than-expected large order activity, which drove the upside for the quarter. That said, we are not yet seeing a broad-based recovery. And as a result, we continue to take an agile approach to navigating the current environment.\nWe also delivered another quarter of sequential improvement in profitability as a result of our restructuring actions and improved gross margin. Services and software were a bright spot in the quarter with improved sales and profitability, helping to offset the year-on-year sales declines across all product categories.\nFor the quarter, we realized sales of $1.2 billion, a 16.8% decline from the prior year, and adjusted EBITDA margin of 19.9%, a 150 basis point decrease and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.84, a 28% decrease from the prior year. We are pleased with the progress we have made on our previously announced actions to improve profitability and drive sales growth as our end markets recover. Our restructuring plans to deliver $120 million of net annualized operating savings is on track to be completed midyear.\nOn the supply front, we made substantial improvement in our working capital driven by our renegotiation of long-term supply commitments and ongoing work to drive down component inventories with our contract manufacturers. We have also driven both tactical and strategic sales initiatives, including reallocation of resources to accelerate growth. Given the progress on our actions, we are raising our full year outlook for sales, margin and free cash flow.\nI will now turn the call over to Nathan to review our Q1 financial results and discuss our revised 2024 outlook.\n\nNathan Andrew Winters\n\nActing CFO, Zebra Technologies Corporation\n\nThank you, Bill. Let's start with the T&L on Slide 6. In Q1, sales decreased 16.8% with declines across our regions, major product categories and customers of all sizes. Services and software were a bright spot in the quarter, with growth driven by increased units under support contract and retail software wins. Our Asset Intelligence & Tracking segment declined 25.3% primarily driven by printing.\nEnterprise Visibility & Mobility segment sales declined 11.8% with relative outperformance in mobile computing. Our Asia Pacific region saw the steepest sales declines led by continued weakness in China. From a sequential perspective, total Q1 sales were 16% higher than Q4 as distributors had completed their destocking process by year-end and we realized modest improvement in demand.\nAdjusted gross margin increased 60 basis points to 48.1% supported by higher services and software margins and cycling premium supply chain costs in the prior year, all of which were partially offset by expense deleveraging from lower sales volumes. Adjusted operating expenses delivered 230 basis points as a percent of sales. The impact was mitigated by approximately $25 million of incremental net savings in the quarter from our restructuring actions. This resulted in first quarter adjusted EBITDA margin of 19.9%, a 150 basis point decrease versus the prior year and a 450 basis point sequential improvement from Q4.\nNon-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $2.84, a 28% year-over-year decrease. Interest expense contributed to the decline, offset by a lower adjusted tax rate. Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow on Slide 7. We generated $111 million of free cash flow as we begin to realize benefits from reducing inventory levels. We ended the quarter at 2.6x net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio, which is slightly above the top end of our target range. And we had approximately $1.3 billion of capacity on our revolving credit facility as of quarter end, providing ample flexibility.\nLet's now turn to our outlook. For Q2, we expect sales to decrease between 1% and 5% compared to the prior year. We entered the second quarter with a solid backlog and pipeline of opportunities, particularly for mobile computing in retail and e-commerce. This outlook assumes a modest improvement in demand trends across our major product categories, with mobile computing and the EVM segment returning to growth as we cycle easier compares.\nWe anticipate Q2 adjusted EBITDA margin to be slightly above 19% driven by expense deleveraging from lower sales volume with the benefit from restructuring actions and lower premium supply chain costs, offset by normalized incentive compensation expense. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $2.60 to $2.90. We have raised our guide for the full year, reflecting our progress on actions to drive sales and profitability as our end markets have stabilized.\nAlthough there is optimism from partners and customers regarding recovery in the second half of the year, we would like to see additional momentum in large orders before factoring in a broader recovery. We now expect sales growth between 1% and 5% for the year, with adjusted EBITDA margin now expected to be approximately 20%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $11.25 to $12.25. And we now expect our free cash flow for the year to be at least $600 million, including the impact of our final $45 million settlement payment in the quarter.\nWe have been making progress rightsizing inventory in our balance sheet and improving cash conversion and have been prioritizing debt paydown in the near term. Please reference additional modeling assumptions shown on Slide 8. With that, I will turn the call back to Bill.\n\nWilliam J. Burns\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cross Country Healthcare, Inc.\n\nThank you, Nathan. As we look longer term, we continue to be well positioned to benefit from secular trends to digitize and automate workflows for our customers. We remain focused on elevating Zebra as a premier solutions provider through a comprehensive portfolio of innovative solutions and our go-to-market ecosystem. Zebra empowers workers to execute test more effectively by navigating constant change in real time through advanced capabilities, including intelligent automation, machine learning, prescriptive analytics and artificial intelligence.\nAs you see on Slide 11, our customers leverage our solutions to optimize workflows across a broad range of end markets. We empower enterprises to increase collaboration and productivity and better serve their customers, shoppers and patients. In March, at the MODEX Manufacturing and Supply Chain trade show, Zebra, along with our partners, showcase our expanded portfolio of solutions that are modernizing workflows across the broader supply chain.\nManaging operations has become complex with increased consumer expectations for inventory visibility and same-day deliveries. The event provided an opportunity to demonstrate how we improve key outcomes such as production quality, supply chain agility and capacity utilization. Machine vision was one of the many solutions we featured where we have enhanced our capabilities to address emerging use cases. We continue to build our market presence with a few notable wins.\nA large state-owned European logistics company recently invested in thousands of Zebra machine vision cameras to enhance the speed and efficiency of inspections of government bonds and transaction documents. Additionally, an Asian manufacturer incorporate our machine vision cameras and frame grabbers, into their product sorting and quality control processes. This solution is significantly faster and more accurate than the previous manual approach.\nAt HIMSS, the leading Global Healthcare Conference, Zebra and our partners demonstrated how our solutions improve the patient journey from check-in to bedside point-of-care as well as medical equipment track and trace. Additionally, the University of Maryland Health System shared how they are utilizing our clinical communications platform, which includes our mobile computers and work cloud software.\nI'd also like to call out a win with a North America hospital network, who recently implemented thousands of Zebra printers, specifically enhancing its specimen tracking and labeling processes. These printers integrate with the electronic health record system facilitating noticeable organizational improvements across departments. Zebra's reputation for ease of use helps secure this win.\nRecent wins in retail, demonstrate how customers are driving productivity improving asset visibility, enhancing the experience for associates and shoppers. The European retailer selected thousands of Zebra mobile computers to replace their legacy devices from a competitor. The customer plans to pair our new mobile computers with their Zebra mobile printers to improve their price markdown, labeling and online order picking processes.\nThe North America-based retail department store chain enhanced thousands of Zebra mobile computers by incorporating our device tracking software. Prior deployment of this software, the retailer experienced issues with misplaced devices in stores and fulfillment centers, resulting in wasted time and resources. Additionally, a North American grocer has expanded their installed base of Zebra mobile computers with thousands of additional units and implemented our work cloud software. The solution is expected to enhance operational efficiency among associates, improve employee communication and streamline inventory management within their stores.\nOn Slide 12, we highlight secular trends that we expect to support long-term growth for Zebra as we drive value for our customers. These include labor and resource constraints, real-time supply chain visibility, track and trace mandates and increased consumer expectations. We are hosting an innovation day on May 14 at our headquarters near Chicago where Nathan and I will be joined by other members of our leadership team to discuss how we digitize and automate workflows to drive positive business outcomes for customers across our end markets.\nIn closing, as we look forward to a long-term opportunity for Zebra, our conviction in the business remains strong. We continue to elevate our strategic role with our customers through our innovative portfolio of solutions while our cost and go-to-market actions are positioning us well for profitable growth as our end markets recover.\nI will now hand it back to Mike."

Now let's turn to Slide 4 as I hand it over to Bill.\n\nWilliam J. Burns\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cross Country Healthcare, Inc.\n\nThank you, Mike. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Today, we will discuss our results, the demand environment and progress and actions we are taking to optimize our cost structure and drive sales as demand recovers. As expected, our fourth quarter performance was impacted by continued broad-based softness across our end markets and regions, which resulted in a significant decline in sales and profitability. For the quarter, we realized sales of $1 billion, a 33% decline from the prior year, and adjusted EBITDA margin of 15.4%, a 7-point decrease and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.71 a 64% decrease from the prior year. Although we experienced declines across all product categories, services and software were a bright spot in the quarter.\nFrom a sequential perspective, we realized Q4 sales growth from Q3 as demand trends stabilize. Overall profitability was primarily impacted by expense deleveraging on lower sales volumes, in a charge to renegotiate a supplier contract. However, as a result of our cost restructuring actions and inventory management initiatives, we realized a significant sequential improvement in profitability and free cash flow.\nTurning to Slide 5. I'd like to update you on our actions to address and mitigate the impacts of the current demand environment and position ourselves for long-term growth. As referenced in our earnings release, we have expanded the scope of our previously announced cost reduction plan and now expect $120 million of net annualized operating savings, an increase of $20 million from our last update which we expect to implement by mid-2024. Our previously announced actions were substantially completed in the fourth quarter enabled us to realize approximately $50 million of savings in 2023. On the supply front, we continue to work with our contract manufacturers to draw down component inventories, and we are substantially complete with renegotiations of long-term supply commitments.\nIn Q4, we renegotiated 2021 agreement with a key electronic component supplier, incurring a $10 million expense. The revised agreement cancels a portion of the multiyear volume commitment and increases purchasing flexibility. We have also reallocated resources to accelerate growth in underpenetrated markets, including Japan, along with government and manufacturing sectors and to address new automation use cases with RFID and machine vision. We expect our actions to improve profitability and drive sales growth as our end markets recover. We saw double-digit declines across each of our end markets for both Q4 and full year as many customers navigate a challenging environment and absorb capacity they built out during the pandemic to address the spike in e-commerce activity.\nOn Slide 6, we highlight secular trends that we expect to drive long-term growth including labor and resource constraints, real-time supply chain visibility, track and trace mandates and increased consumer expectations. These are all focused areas in my conversations with our customers. Entering 2024, distributor inventories are aligned with current demand. Although we are seeing some improvement in order activity, we are not yet seeing any signs of a broad market recovery and remain cautious in our planning. Consequently, we continue to take an agile approach to navigating this uncertain environment and remain disciplined with respect to our cost structure and capital allocation. I will now turn the call over to Nathan to review our Q4 financial results and discuss our 2024 outlook.\n\nNathan Andrew Winters\n\nActing CFO, Zebra Technologies Corporation\n\nThank you, Bill. Let's start with the P&L on Slide 8. In Q4, sales decreased 33% with distributor destocking accounting for more than 1/4 of the decline. We saw double-digit sales declines across our regions, major product categories and customers of all sizes. Our Asset Intelligence and Tracking segment declined 33.6%, primarily driven by printing. Enterprise Visibility & Mobility segment sales declined 32.7% led by data capture and mobile computing. On a positive note, we drove services growth with strong attach and renewal rates. From a sequential perspective, total Q4 sales were $53 million higher than Q3. And despite a similar magnitude of distributor inventory destocking due to modest improvement in demand. Adjusted gross margin decreased 100 basis points to 44.6% and primarily due to expense deleveraging from lower sales volumes and the $10 million charge mentioned earlier associated with the renegotiation of a supplier agreement, all of which were partially offset by higher services and software margin and cycling premium supply chain costs in the prior year.\nAdjusted operating expenses delevered 670 basis points as a percent of sales. The impact was mitigated by more than $20 million of net savings in the quarter from our restructuring actions. This resulted in fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA margin of 15.4%, a 710 basis point decrease. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.71, a 64% year-over-year decrease. Increased interest expense contributed to the decline offset by a lower tax rate from executing on a global tax strategy.\nTurning now to the balance sheet and cash flow on Slide 9. We ended the quarter at a 2.5x net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio which is at the top end of our target range. We generated $102 million of free cash flow in Q4 and had approximately $1.1 billion of capacity on our revolving credit facility as of year-end, providing ample flexibility. For the full year 2023, negative free cash flow of $91 million was unfavorable to the prior year, primarily due to lower operating profit, higher interest and tax payments restructuring actions and previously announced settlement payments, all of which were partially offset by lower incentive compensation payments.\nLet's now turn to our outlook. We entered 2024 with distributor inventory levels aligned with recent demand trends and improved backlog driven by modest year-end budget spending into January from certain retailers. For Q1, we expect a sales decrease between 17% and 20% compared to the prior year. This outlook assumes continued declines across our major product categories, particularly printing and a 50 basis point favorable impact from FX. We anticipate Q1 adjusted EBITDA margin to be approximately 18%, driven by expense deleveraging from lower sales volume, partially offset by lower premium supply chain costs. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $2.30 to $2.60. Q1 sales and profitability are expected to sequentially increase from Q4 as distributor inventories and end market demand has stabilized, and we have realized incremental benefits from cost actions. For the full year 2024, we expect sales to be in the range of a 1% decline and 3% growth. Although we are beginning to see signs of improvement in order activity, we are not yet seeing signs of a broad market recovery.\nConsequently, we are taking a cautious approach to our guide until we have increased visibility to a sustained recovery in demand. Adjusted EBITDA for the full year 2024 is expected to be approximately 19%. We expect our restructuring actions and other profitability initiatives to drive improvement through the year delivering EBITDA margin of 20% in the second half. We remain cautious in our spending and continue to take an agile approach to navigating the environment. We expect our free cash flow in 2024 and to be at least $550 million, including the impact of our final $45 million settlement payment in Q1. We remain focused on rightsizing inventory on our balance sheet, driving 100% cash conversion over a cycle and prioritizing debt paydown in the near term. Please reference additional modeling assumptions shown on Slide 10. With that, I will turn the call to Bill to discuss how we are advancing our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision.\n\nWilliam J. Burns\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cross Country Healthcare, Inc.\n\nThank you, Nathan. As you look towards the long-term opportunity for Zebra, our future is bright.

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Mike Steele, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nMichael A. Steele\n\nVice President-Investor Relations, Zebra Technologies Corp.\n\nGood morning, and welcome to Zebra Second Quarter Conference Call. This presentation is being simulcast on our website at investors.zebra.com and will be archived there for at least 1 year.\nOur forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially, and we refer you to the factors discussed in our SEC filings. During this call, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures as we describe our business performance.

Throughout this presentation, unless otherwise indicated, our references to sales growth are year-over-year on a constant currency basis and exclude results from recently acquired businesses for the 12 months following each acquisition.\nAdditionally, note that our Asset Intelligence and Tracking segment now includes our RFID solutions, and we have recast quarterly segment results since 2021 in a schedule included in the appendix of our earnings press release. This presentation will include prepared remarks from Bill Burns, our Chief Executive Officer; and Nathan Winters, our Chief Financial Officer. Bill will begin with our second quarter results, then Nathan will provide additional detail on the financials and discuss our revised 2023 outlook. Bill will conclude with progress made on advancing our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision. Following the prepared remarks, Joe Heel, our Chief Revenue Officer, will join us as we take your questions.\nNow let's turn to Slide 4 as I hand it over to Bill.\n\nWilliam J. Burns\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cross Country Healthcare, Inc.\n\nThank you, Mike. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Our second quarter results were impacted by weakening demand and cautious customer spending behavior across our end markets. While these results are certainly disappointing to us, we'll spend some time today discussing the drivers that are having the greatest impact as well as the actions we are taking to control what we can in a difficult demand environment, including our expanded cost reduction initiatives.\nFor the quarter, we realized sales of $1.2 billion, a 16% decline from the prior year, and adjusted EBITDA margin of 21.2%, a 70-basis-point decrease, and a non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.29, a 29% decrease from the prior year.\nLet me now put these results in context. On our last quarter call, we discussed a broader softening of industry demand as customers tightened their CapEx budgets and IT device spending slows. During the second quarter, those trends accelerated as we saw more cautious spending behavior by our customers of all sizes across our vertical end markets and regions. While all end markets declined, demand was weakest in retail and e-commerce, in transportation and logistics as many customers are absorbing capacity they build out during the pandemic. These dynamics have been exacerbated by our distributors' focus on reducing their inventory levels which accounted for approximately 20% of our Q2 sales decline.\nOur distribution channel has been aggressively driving down inventory as end-user demand has slowed, product lead times have recovered and the cost of holding working capital has increased. Although global macro indicators have been resilient, the goods economy has underperformed the services economy. And certain key indicators most relevant to our industry have become significantly weaker, including IT device spending. This particular metric has been most correlated with mobile computing, where sales declines have accelerated year-to-date following more than 2 years of very strong demand.\nGrowth across RFID, data capture, supplies, services and software were bright spots in the quarter. From a profitability perspective, improved gross margin and cost controls enabled us to achieve our EBITDA margin and EPS outlook for the second quarter.\nIn our current market environment, swift action is needed, and we are taking a number of steps to position us to deliver profitable growth and improve free cash flow.\nSlide 5 summarizes key industry challenges that have intensified since our prior update and our actions to address and mitigate the impacts. These actions include reducing spending across the organization, including additional restructuring actions to drive an incremental $65 million of net annualized operating savings as we exit 2023, increasing our focus on accelerating growth in underpenetrated markets and continue to work closely with our customers as we continue to digitize and automate their environments.\nOur revised full year outlook incorporates the slowdown and deceleration across our end markets including a significant reduction in near-term demand in the mobile computing market, destocking by our distributors as well as a partial year benefit of our expanded restructuring actions. Given our limited visibility in this environment, we are cautious in our assumptions and not expecting a recovery in 2023. We expect the reset of our cost structure and shift of our go-to-market resources to drive sales growth and improve profitability as our end markets recover. We will continue to take an agile approach to managing through this uncertain near-term environment.\nI will now turn the call over to Nathan to review our Q2 financial results and provide additional details on our revised 2023 outlook.\n\nNathan Andrew Winters\n\nActing CFO, Zebra Technologies Corporation\n\nThank you, Bill. Let's start with the P&L on Slide 7. In Q2, net sales decreased 17.3%, including the impact of currency and acquisitions and were 16% lower on an organic basis. Our Asset Intelligence and Tracking segment was flat strength in RFID and supplies was offset by a decline in printing as we lap particularly strong prior year results. Enterprise Visibility & Mobility segment sales declined 23.6% and driven by a sharp decline in mobile computing, partially offset by growth in data capture solution.\nAdditionally, we drove organic growth across service and software with strong service attach rates. Sales declined across our regions, driven by broad-based double-digit declines in mobile computing. In North America, sales decreased to 11%. EMEA sales declined 24% with pronounced weakness in Eastern Europe. Asia Pacific sales decreased 17%, driven by China and India with growth in Japan and Australia. And Latin America sales decreased 6%, partially offset by growth in Brazil and Mexico.\nAdjusted gross margin increased 200 basis points to 48%, primarily due to lower premium supply chain costs and favorable business mix and pricing, partially offset by expense deleveraging and unfavorable FX. We are pleased to see gross margins recovering from the inflationary headwinds we experienced over the past couple of years.\nNote, that as we began to see demand soften, we announced incremental restructuring plans that are expected to drive $65 million of net annualized operating expense savings as they are implemented, including previous actions taken over the past year, our total net annual cost savings is $85 million. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 21.2%, a 70-basis-point decrease driven by operating expense deleveraging partially offset by improved gross margin. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $3.29, a 29% year-over-year decrease. Increased interest expense contributed to the decline partially offset by fewer shares outstanding.\nTurning now to the balance sheet and cash flow on Slide 8. For the first half of 2023, negative free cash flow of $144 million was unfavorable to the prior year period, primarily due to a greater use of net working capital due to higher cash taxes and payments for inventory. And $45 million of previously announced quarterly settlement payments, which are scheduled to conclude in Q1 of 2024, partially offset by lower incentive compensation payments. In the first half of 2023, we also made $52 million of share repurchases and invested $1 million in our venture portfolio. We ended the quarter at a 1.8x net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio, which is below the top end of our target range of 2.5x. And had approximately $1.1 billion of capacity on our revolving credit facility.\nOn Slide 9, we highlight the impact of premium supply chain costs on our gross margin over the past 2.5 years. The actions we have taken to redesign products and increase price along with improving freight rates and capacity have enabled us to avoid component purchases on the spot market and reduce the freight cost impact. In Q2, we incurred premium supply chain costs of an incremental $5 million as compared to the pre-pandemic baseline. And $51 million lower than the prior year quarter. As we enter the third quarter, we believe these costs will have been fully mitigated, which is a key lever to margin recovery.\nLet's now turn to our outlook. As we enter the third quarter, we are seeing sharp broad-based declines across most of our product offerings, which continue to be amplified by distributors recalibrating their inventory to lower demand trends. Our Q3 sales are expected to decline between 30% and 35% compared to the prior year. This outlook assumes double-digit declines across each of our core product categories, with distributor destocking accounting for approximately 1/3 of the decline. We anticipate Q3 adjusted EBITDA margin to be between 10% and 12%, driven by expense deleveraging from lower sales volume partially offset by higher gross margin from cycling $30 million of premium supply chain costs in the prior year period. Non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $0.60 to $1.\nGiven our Q2 results and the continued challenging demand environment, we are significantly reducing our full year outlook, expecting a sales decline between 20% and 23%. This assumes that Q3 sales trajectory continues through the remainder of the year. We are seeing broad-based declines across our end markets as we enter the second half with significant uncertainty in this environment. We expect full year adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 18%. We expect increased deleveraging on significantly reduced sales volumes expectations, partially offset by early benefits from cost reduction actions as most of the actions will be implemented by early Q4.\nWe plan to continue to align our cost structure with a long-term trajectory of our business. We now expect free cash flow to be positive in the second half. But negative for the year given lower sales and earnings expectations. Our cash flow will be impacted by new restructuring charges, increased cash taxes due to the change in R&D expected regulation and $180 million of previously announced settlement payments.\nWe continue to be focused on rightsizing inventory on our balance sheet as component lead times have normalized. However, we now expect minimal inventory reduction in 2023 due to our lower sales outlook. We are focused on achieving 100% cash conversion over a cycle, which is one of the metrics in our long-term incentive compensation plan. Please reference additional modeling assumptions shown on Slide 10. Note that we have improved our expected 2023 non-GAAP tax rate by 1 point due to favorable geographic mix.\nWith that, I will turn the call back to Bill to discuss how we are advancing our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision.\n\nWilliam J. Burns\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cross Country Healthcare, Inc.\n\nThank you, Nathan. While sales are pressured near term, over the long term, our solutions remain essential to our customers' operations, and we are well positioned to benefit from the secular trends to digitize and automate workflows across our served markets.\nWe are focused on advancing our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision by elevating Zebra as a premier solutions provider through our compelling portfolio. By transforming workflows with our proven solutions, Zebra's customers can effectively address their complex operational challenges, including scarcity of labor and the need to improve productivity. We empower the workforce to execute tasks more effectively by navigating constant change in near real time, utilizing insights driven by our advanced software capabilities such as machine learning and prescriptive analytics.\nNow turning to Slide 13. We I would like to highlight several key megatrends, which support Zebra's growth and customer value propositions over the long term. These include automation, mobility and cloud computing and artificial intelligence. Our customers rely on Zebra to help them take advantage of these key megatrends which drive their growth strategies.\nAs you can see on Slide 14, Zebra's Enterprise mobile computers are critical to the front line of business. We're excited about our innovation road map and new solution launches that advance our value proposition. Labor is a scarce resource, and leveraging technology is a key way our customers can advance their operations. Our solutions empower enterprises to increase collaboration and productivity and better serve customers, shoppers and patients by enabling an expanding number of use cases across our end markets. Our Enterprise mobile computing installed base has expanded significantly over the past several years due to the preoperation of use cases and the investment in Zebra's solutions should rebound as technology refreshes are reprioritized.\nOn Slide 15, we highlight a few areas that are advancing our capabilities to serve our customers' evolving needs and are expected to be profitable growth drivers for Zebra as we continue to scale them. Collectively, these offerings are approaching $0.5 billion of annualized sales and have a long runway for growth. First, we are a leader in advanced location solutions through RFID. We have been driving strong double-digit growth in recent years with the heightened importance of real-time inventory accuracy. We are now addressing an expanding set of use cases throughout the supply chain, including our previously announced large win with a global transportation logistics provider, which highlights the long-term growth opportunity for RFID solutions.\nSecond, we believe investments in our machine vision business which is accretive to our gross and EBITDA margins, positions us well for long-term growth. We continue to invest in innovation and go-to-market efforts to further diversify and scale in attractive subcategories. Strong growth in certain end markets, including warehouse distribution and electric vehicle manufacturing has partially offset weakness in the semiconductor industry.\nAn example of our recent success is a win with a U.S.-based global auto manufacturer who has been transitioning to electric vehicle production. The ease of use of our solutions was a key differentiator and as the manufacturer capitalized on disruption in the auto market to modernize its processes with more flexible solutions.\nAnd lastly, our workflow optimization software offerings include workforce and task management, communication and collaboration tools, inventory visibility and demand planning. Recent notable wins include our workforce management solution for location staffing at a large North American bank and our retail demand forecasting solution for our North America consumer packaged goods company.\nThe actions we are taking to improve profitability of our software offerings, including migration to a cloud-based platform are expected to enable software to become EBITDA margin accretive in 2024. In closing, our long-term conviction in our business remains unchanged. While customer spend is pressured near term, over the long term, we believe we are well positioned to benefit from secular trends to digitize and automate workflows. We will work to continue to elevate our position with customers through our comprehensive portfolio of solutions while taking the actions needed to improve profitability and position us for success within the current environment and in the future.\nI will now hand it back to Mike.\n\nMichael A. Steele\n\nVice President-Investor Relations, Zebra Technologies Corp.\n\nThanks, Bill. We'll now open the call to Q&A. We ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up so that we can get to as many of you as possible."

Following the prepared remarks, Joe Heel, our Chief Revenue Officer, will join us as we take your questions.\nNow let's turn to Slide 4 as I hand it over to Anders.\n\nAnders Gustafsson\n\nCEO & Director, Zebra Technologies Corporation\n\nThank you, Mike. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. It was a strong finish to a challenging year, with sales and profitability near the high end of our outlook. For the quarter, we realized sales growth of approximately 4%, an adjusted EBITDA margin of 22.5%, an 80-basis-point increase year-over-year. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $4.75, a 5% increase from the prior year, and strong free cash flow. Our team recovered from distribution challenges in North America to drive record sales volumes, which more than offset softer sales in our EMEA region. From a solutions offering perspective, printing, data capture, tablets and RFID were bright spots, more than offsetting lower sales of mobile computers.\nAlthough we continue to see cautious spending behavior with certain large customers, demand has generally remained solid, with strength in small to midsized orders. We secured a number of exciting wins, helping to drive a strong year-end and momentum into 2023. These wins included a large postal customer in Asia who expects to improve productivity and efficiency by equipping 70,000 mail carriers with our mobile computing solutions. A British grocer expects to improve their shopper experience and drive store efficiencies by deploying 80,000 personal shopper devices. And the European-based auto manufacturer plans to enable process improvement and quality assurance along all stages of the production line with 30,000 Zebra mobile computers. From a profitability perspective, we expanded EBITDA margin and increased EPS by scaling operating expenses and drove our strongest cash flow quarter of the year.\nAs you are aware, in December, we announced that Bill Burns will succeed me as CEO effective March 1. Bill is the ideal leader to continue to advance our strategy and has the full support of our Board and Executive team. Throughout his career, Bill has maintained a strong focus on culture, talent and innovation. He has been a key member of Zebra's executive leadership team since joining us more than 7 years ago to lead and integrate the enterprise business, which we had just acquired at the time. Since the announcement, Bill and I have been busy meeting with stakeholders discussing the transition and Zebra's bright future.\nI've also been taking this opportunity to thank our employees, suppliers and partners for their support and collaboration through the years as we transformed our business. I look forward to continuing to ensure a smooth transition as I assume the role of Executive Chair.\nI will now turn the call over to Nathan to review our Q4 financial results in more detail and discuss our 2023 outlook.\n\nNathan Andrew Winters\n\nCFO, Zebra Technologies Corporation\n\nThank you, Anders. Let's start with the P&L on Slide 7. In Q4, net sales increased 2.5%, including the impact of currency and acquisitions, and 3.9% on an organic basis. Our Asset Intelligence and Tracking segment increased 13.5%, driven by double-digit growth in printing. Enterprise Visibility & Mobility segment sales were approximately flat, with mixed performance among our offerings. We realized particularly strong growth in data capture solutions, including RFID as well as rugged tablets. Mobile computing sales declined, primarily due to challenging prior year compares, particularly in EMEA. We also drove growth across services and software with strong service attach rates.\nPerformance was mixed across our regions. North America sales increased 11%, helped by the recovery from supply chain challenges and strength in data capture and printing. EMEA sales declined 7%, primarily due to the 5-point impact of our suspension of sales into Russia in March as well as lower sales to large customers in Northern Europe. Asia Pacific sales grew 3%, with strength in Japan and growth in China despite COVID challenges late in the quarter. And Latin America sales increased 7%, with strong growth in Brazil and Mexico.\nAdjusted gross margin decreased 10 basis points to 45.6% due to FX, offset by lower premium supply chain costs. Adjusted operating expenses were lower, improving by 100 basis points as a percent of sales, primarily due to lower incentive compensation and effective cost management. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 22.5%, an 80-basis-point increase driven by operating expense scaling. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $4.75, a 4.6% year-over-year increase.\nTurning now to the balance sheet and cash flow highlights on Slide 8. In 2022, we generated $413 million of free cash flow. Although Q4 was strong, the full year was significantly lower than last year, primarily due to a higher use of working capital due to elevated inventory, higher incentive compensation payments given our exceptional 2021 performance, and $135 million of previously announced settlement payments, which are scheduled to conclude in Q1 of 2024. In 2022, we invested approximately $880 million in the Matrox Imaging acquisition to expand our machine vision solutions offering. We made $751 million of share repurchases and invested $12 million in venture investments. We ended the year at a comfortable 1.6x net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio, and with more than $1.4 billion of capacity on our revolving credit facility.\nOn Slide 9, we highlight premium supply chain costs, which have continued to improve from peak levels. The actions we have taken to redesign products, targeted price increases as well as improving freight rates and capacity have enabled us to reduce component purchases on the spot market and reduce the freight cost impact. Additionally, we have increased the volume of printer shipments on ocean from air, which will contribute to reduced freight costs through 2023. In Q4, we incurred premium supply chain costs of $25 million as compared to the pre-pandemic baseline, which was favorable to what we had anticipated in our prior outlook, and $38 million lower than the prior year. We are expecting these premium supply chain costs to steadily decline in 2023.\nLet's now turn to our outlook. Customer demand and our order pipeline remained healthy, yet we continue to see some softening of demand and elongated sales cycles that we referenced last quarter through the uncertain macro environment. We are taking a cautious approach to our sales outlook and expense management while working to rightsize our inventory levels.\nFor the first quarter, our sales are expected to decline between 4% and 1% compared to the prior year. Our outlook assumes a 3-point negative impact from foreign currency changes and a 150-basis-point additive impact from recent acquisitions. This translates to expectations of negative 1% organic growth, which includes a 1-point headwind from sales into Russia last year. We anticipate Q1 adjusted EBITDA margin to be approximately 21%, driven by higher gross margins from improving supply chain costs despite significant FX headwinds. We expect premium supply chain costs to be approximately $20 million in Q1, a nearly $50 million year-over-year reduction. Non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $3.70 to $4.\nFor the full year 2023, we anticipate net sales to be in the range of a 3% decline and 1% growth. This outlook assumes a 50-basis-point net negative impact from foreign currency changes and acquisitions as FX headwinds moderate throughout the year. We anticipate full year adjusted EBITDA margin between 22% and 23%. We expect premium supply chain costs of approximately $50 million for the year, with continued improvement in product availability.\nWe have also proactively managed operating expenses as evidenced by OpEx scaling in Q4 and recent targeted restructuring actions as we enter 2023, which enabled us to preserve strategic investments in the business. We expect our free cash flow to be at least $650 million for the year, which reflects the benefit of working down elevated inventory levels through the year, higher cash taxes and $180 million of previously announced settlement payments. Please reference additional modeling assumptions shown on Slide 10. Note that the cost of borrowing is expected to be approximately 5% to 6% this year, and our non-GAAP tax rate is expected to be approximately 19% due to the United Kingdom corporate tax rate increase.\nWith that, I will turn the call to Bill to discuss how we are advancing our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision.\n\nWilliam J. Burns\n\nChief Product & Solutions Officer, Zebra Technologies Corporation\n\nThank you, Nathan. Before I talk about the progress we are making on our vision, I'd like to take a moment to thank Anders for his exceptional leadership with Zebra over the last 15 years. Through disciplined organic investment and strategic acquisitions, he's led the transformation of Zebra. He sponsored an innovative and authentic culture that has received many awards recognizing Zebra as a great place to work. Also under his leadership, shareholder value creation has significantly exceeded broader market benchmarks. I'm excited to build upon Anders legacy by continuing to advance our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision.\nSlide 12 illustrates how we digitize and automate the front line of business by leveraging our industry-leading portfolio of products, software and services. By transforming workflows with our proven solutions that generate an attractive return on investment, Zebra's customers can effectively address their increasingly complex operational challenges. Our innovative solutions empower the workforce to do their jobs more effectively by navigating constant change in a near real-time, utilizing insights driven by our advanced software capabilities such as Prescriptive Analytics and Intelligent Automation.\nAs I focus on moving Zebra forward, we will collaborate closely with customers and partners to continue to elevate Zebra as a premier solutions provider and work to attract, develop and retain top global talent to drive innovation.\nSlide 13 summarizes our served market opportunities and long-term growth profile. The fundamental drivers of our business remain intact. Mega trends, including the on-demand economy, asset visibility, mobility and cloud computing and intelligent automation, provides secular tailwinds for our business. I am proud of the progress we're making in elevating our strategic relationship with our customers. We continue to extend our leadership position in our core business and are gaining traction in adjacent and expansion markets, which have higher growth profiles. Anders and Nathan highlighted RFID as a bright spot, where we have a comprehensive solutions offering for a wide range of use cases.\nOur momentum continues as we were just awarded a record RFID win last week. Another highlight is our market share gains in rugged tablets as a result of our focused investment. Overall, I believe we're well positioned to deliver 5% to 7% organic growth over a cycle, with an increasing attractive margin profile as we drive continued traction across our core, adjacent and expansion markets.\nNow we turn to Slide 14. Businesses partnered with Zebra to optimize their end-to-end workflows as they strive to meet an increasing demands of consumers across a variety of vertical end markets. As you can see on the slide, we address a wide range of workflows and use cases across retail and e-commerce, transportation, logistics, manufacturing, healthcare and other markets. Anders highlighted a few recent wins across these markets. The breadth of business challenges we are addressing has been expanding through our investment in new offerings and markets, enabling us to further penetrate customer accounts.\nFor example, leveraging our existing relationships enabled us to secure autonomous mobile robot and machine vision wins with our customers in manufacturing and warehouse use cases. We see a tremendous opportunity to continues to elevate and grow our customer relationships through our expanded solutions offerings.\nOn Slide 15, we highlight how Zebra was able to showcase how our solutions positively impact retail store operations to more than 1,300 customers at the National Retail Federation's trade show last month. At the event, we brought the modern store concept to life by demonstrating how our portfolio of solutions empower retailers to better engage associates, optimize inventory and elevate the customer experience. Our booth featured representatives from 2 prominent retailers who share how our solutions have improved their operational challenges. [Although some] improvement has realized the synergies of combining Zebra's mobile printers, mobile computers and our workflow optimization software solutions that improve the customer experience, increase efficiency and reduce friction in their workflows.\nZebra's solutions have resulted in increased customer satisfaction by improving inventory accuracy and streamlining the buy online, pick up in store experience as well as over 1 million hours of annualized labor savings and reduced label waste. Vera Bradley has improved associate engagement and retention by prioritizing workloads through our task and workforce management software solutions. By leveraging Zebra's mobile devices and software solutions, they can now align the right task to the right associate in real time, and increased employee satisfaction by reducing friction in schedule. Additionally, insights in our software solutions elevate the customers' experience for Vera Bradley by empowering frontline associates with better information, including visibility of product inventory and pricing.\nIn closing, I look forward to working with our team to advance our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision by fostering an innovation -- innovative culture, collaborating with our customers and partners and delivering profitable growth across our core adjacent expansion markets.\nNow I'll hand it back to Mike.\n\nMichael A. Steele\n\nVP of IR, Zebra Technologies Corporation\n\nThanks, Bill. We'll now open the call to Q&A. We ask that you limit yourself to 1 question and 1 follow-up so that we can get through as many of you as possible."

(Operator Instructions) Please note, today's event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mike Steele, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nMichael A. Steele\n\nVP of IR, Zebra Technologies Corporation\n\nGood morning, and welcome to Zebra's first quarter conference call. This presentation is being simulcast on our website at investors.zebra.com and will be archived there for at least 1 year.\nOur forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially due to factors discussed in our SEC filings.\nDuring this call, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures as we describe our business performance. You can find reconciliations at the end of the slide presentation and in today's earnings press release.\nThroughout this presentation, unless otherwise indicated, our references to sales growth are year-over-year, on a constant currency basis and exclude results from recently acquired businesses for the 12 months following each acquisition. This presentation will include prepared remarks from Anders Gustafsson, our Chief Executive Officer; and Nathan Winters, our Chief Financial Officer. Anders will begin with our first quarter results. Then Nathan will provide additional detail on the financials and discuss our revised 2022 outlook. Anders will conclude with progress made on advancing our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision. Following the prepared remarks, Joe Heel, our Chief Revenue Officer, will join us as we take your questions. Now let's turn to Slide 4 as I hand it over to Anders.\n\nAnders Gustafsson\n\nCEO & Director, Zebra Technologies Corporation\n\nThank you, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Our team delivered solid first quarter results in an exceptionally challenging macro environment. For the quarter, we realized adjusted net sales growth of greater than 5%, and adjusted EBITDA margin of 19.9%, a 540 basis point decrease and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $4.01, a 16% decrease from the prior year.\nCustomer demand remains strong for our solutions that digitize and automate workflows. We realized sales growth across all 4 regions, supported by exceptional strength in mobile computing with particularly strong growth in Asia Pacific and Latin America. Our teams have continued to manage supply chain constraints as we navigate significant global macro uncertainty, including COVID-19 lockdowns across Asia. We were able to secure more supply in mobile computing and scanning than we originally anticipated, which more than offset the impact of suspending shipments to Russia in early March. However, we were unable to fully satisfy customer demand, particularly for our printing products.\nSupply chain costs were greater than our expectations and significantly weighed on gross margin, which was partially offset by higher service and software margin. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenue increased due to acquisitions in our expansion markets and resuming in-person events. Overall, we are pleased that our first quarter sales and earnings performance exceeded the high end of our guidance ranges despite extreme supply chain challenges including transitory costs that were higher than our expectations. With that, I will now turn the call over to Nathan to review our Q1 financial results in more detail and discuss our revised 2022 outlook.\n\nNathan Andrew Winters\n\nCFO, Zebra Technologies Corporation\n\nThank you, Anders. Let's start with the P&L on Slide 6. In Q1, adjusted net sales increased 6.1%, including the impact of currency and acquisitions, and 5.4% on an organic basis as we successfully secured a greater supply of mobile computers and data capture products than we had anticipated.\nOur Asset Intelligence and Tracking segment, including printing and supplies, declined 8.1% due to significant supply constraints on our printing products as well as cycling strong prior year results. Enterprise Visibility & Mobility segment sales increased 11.6%, driven by exceptional growth in mobile computing. We continue to drive solid growth across services and software with strong service attach rates and expansion of our software offerings.\nWe recognized growth in all 4 regions. North America sales increased 2% with strength across the portfolio with the exception of printing. EMEA sales increased 2% driven by strong growth in mobile computing. Asia Pacific sales grew 28% with strength across all major geographies, including China. And in Latin America, sales increased 31% with exceptional growth in Mexico.\nAdjusted gross margin declined 430 basis points to 44.6% due to unprecedented premium supply chain costs and unfavorable product mix partially offset by higher service and software margins. We will discuss our supply chain expenses further in a moment.\nAdjusted operating expenses as a percentage of sales increased 100 basis points primarily due to new business acquisitions in our expansion markets as well as increased marketing activities and employee travel costs as we return to in-person events.\nFirst quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 19.9%, a 540 basis point decrease from the prior year period primarily due to negative gross margin impact of unprecedented supply chain costs. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $4.01, a 16.3% year-over-year decrease.\nTurning now to the balance sheet and cash flow highlights on Slide 7. Our balance sheet remains strong. From a debt leverage perspective, we ended the quarter at a modest 0.8x net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio, which provides us ample flexibility. In Q1, we generated $40 million of free cash flow, which was lower than last year primarily due to higher incentive compensation payments given our exceptional 2021 performance and a higher use of working capital as sales volumes shifted to later in the quarter.\nWe also made $305 million of share repurchases as we have been opportunistic in a volatile market. On Slide 8, we show the impact of transitory costs related to industry-wide supply chain disruption caused by the pandemic. Our team continues to work all avenues to satisfy strong customer demand, including product redesigns, long-term supply agreements, buying critical components in the spot market along with expediting component parts and finished goods to meet our commitments to our customers.\nIn Q1, we incurred incremental premium supply chain costs of $69 million as compared to the pre-pandemic baseline, which was higher than we had anticipated in our prior outlook. In total, transitory items had a combined unfavorable gross margin impact of $57 million year-over-year.\nOver the past year, these elevated supply chain costs have continued to evolve. At this point, approximately 1/2 of the impact is associated with buying critical components on the spot market at elevated prices and expedited shipping of our printing products via air versus ocean. We expect this portion of the impact to improve throughout the year based on committed volumes from our key suppliers. The remaining half of the impact is associated with elevated freight costs. In Q1, we saw shipping cost per kilo improved, and we assume March pricing holds through the remainder of the year.\nThe war in Eastern Europe and lockdowns in manufacturing sites in China have elevated our supply chain costs above our prior expectations and delayed the improvement we had expected. We now anticipate approximately $200 million of premium supply chain costs for the full year. This impact is net of the anticipated impact of a price increase announced last week across our product portfolio that will become effective as we enter the second half of the year.\nLet's now turn to our outlook. We entered the second quarter with a strong order backlog and healthy sales pipeline supported by broad-based demand for our solutions. Our expected sales growth of 3% to 7% is limited by what we can deliver to our customers due to extended lead times and limited availability of component parts, amplified by COVID-19 lockdowns across China. Our guide assumes steady improvement in Chinese manufacturing output. Our outlook also assumes a neutral impact from acquisitions and foreign currency changes.\nWe anticipate Q2 adjusted EBITDA margin to be between 20% and 21%, which assumes gross margin contraction from the prior year due to unfavorable sales mix and expected premium supply chain costs of $60 million, which translates to an approximately 260 basis point decremental margin impact as compared to the prior year period. We also expect increased operating expenses as a percentage of sales primarily due to our entry into multiple expansion markets since last spring and resuming in-person events. Non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $4.05 to $4.35.\nFor the full year 2022, we are reiterating our outlook of adjusted net sales growth between 3% and 7%. Demand continues to be robust, and product supply is improving, which offsets the headwind of 1 to 2 points of sales into Russia and global macro uncertainty that is escalated since our prior outlook. This sales growth outlook now assumes a 50 basis point detrimental net impact from foreign currency and business acquisitions due to the significant move in the euro since our prior update.\nWe now anticipate full year 2022 adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 22% to 23%, which is 1 point lower than our previous guide due to our revised expectation of supply chain costs, which are $60 million higher than the impact we realized in 2021.\nWe now expect our free cash flow to be at least $800 million for the year, which we have reduced due to the increase in expected supply chain costs as well as the anticipated increased use of working capital due to the timing of sales and inventory replenishment. Note that our outlook excludes the pending acquisition of Matrox Imaging, which Anders will cover in a moment.\nPlease reference additional modeling assumptions shown on Slide 9. With that, I will turn the call back to Anders to discuss how we are advancing our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision.\n\nAnders Gustafsson\n\nCEO & Director, Zebra Technologies Corporation\n\nThank you, Nathan. I am encouraged by the strong demand across our business and the bold actions our teams are taking to navigate the supply chain challenges and the uncertain global environment. Slide 11 illustrates how we digitize and automate the front line of business by leveraging our industry-leading portfolio of products, software and services. By transforming workflows with our proven solutions, Zebra's customers can effectively address their complex operational challenges, which have been magnified by the pandemic. We empower the workforce to do their jobs more efficiently by navigating constant change in near real time, utilizing insights driven by advanced software capabilities such as prescriptive analytics, intelligent automation and machine vision.\nWe were very excited to resume active participation in trade show events. At MODEX '22, the world's premier supply chain show, Zebra showcased our solutions, which provide intelligent automation to help warehouses increase their productivity as e-commerce accelerates. Attendees were interested in the dynamic orchestration between our autonomous mobile robots and warehouse associates equipped with our wearable technology, which significantly increases pick productivity. Zebra also demonstrated how our fixed industrial scanners and autonomous mobile robots work together to increase efficiency and reduced costs in warehouse operations.\nAt HIMSS, the leading global health care conference, customers were excited to see how our solutions are designed to connect critical equipment, patients and caregivers to address challenges across their operations, ranging from patient identification to pharmaceutical supply chain visibility. Our booth featured track and trace technologies including scan and print solutions that increase the accuracy of inventory supply management to improve throughput, reduce waste and inform sourcing decisions. We also highlighted how Zebra's RFID solutions can further improve health care operations and patient safety.\nEarlier this year, we raised our long-term organic sales growth expectations to 5% to 7% and provided a refreshed view of our served markets, as noted on Slide 12. These expectations are supported by mega trends, including the on-demand economy, asset visibility, mobility and cloud computing and automation. These trends have become increasingly important to our enterprise customers and are now a higher priority as labor shortages and cost inflation continue to bring more challenges.\nOur announcement in March to acquire Matrox Imaging, a recognized leader in machine vision, underscores our commitment to scaling into these expansion markets.\nSlide 13 illustrates how the Matrox acquisition will enable us to create a comprehensive portfolio of fixed industrial scanning and machine vision solutions, building on our smart camera product launch last year and augmenting our growing expertise in software and deep learning.\nMatrox brings a complementary offering of products and solutions, including advanced smart cameras, vision controllers and 3D sensors as well as one of the most sophisticated software imaging libraries in the market. These solutions capture, inspect, assess and record data from industrial systems in factory automation, electronics, pharmaceuticals and semiconductor industries. Customers benefit from increased productivity and improved product quality.\nWith this acquisition, Zebra will become even better positioned to serve our customers' increasingly complex needs regardless of where they are on their automation journey. Matrox generates annual sales of approximately $100 million with a higher profit margin profile than Zebra. The $875 million acquisition is expected to close midyear.\nNow turning to Slide 14. Businesses partner with Zebra to help optimize their end-to-end workflows as they strive to meet increasing demands of consumers. I would like to highlight several recent key wins across our end markets. A truck stop operator in North America recently began rolling out our test management and prescriptive analytics software solutions to its more than 700 locations. We are addressing this customer's need to track and optimize its internal supplies and retail inventory levels in real time while prioritizing and directing employee resources to the highest value opportunities. The feedback loop on task execution is critical as they aim to maximize productivity and customer satisfaction.\nA large supermarket operator in Europe has expanded its use of Zebra products, including mobile computers and scanners to address click and collect use cases for buy online, pick up in-store transactions, price checking, loss prevention, inventory reallocation among stores and improved product availability. This expansion win demonstrates the productivity benefit of a more connected and empowered workforce.\nOne of the largest railroad freight companies in North America is deploying our TC57 mobile computers to its train conductors and employees working in the rail yards. They use the devices to ensure cargo is onboarded to the correct train or truck for the next leg of its journey and to automate time and attendance tasks and daily activity of the train crew. The ruggedness and productivity of the Zebra solution was a key differentiator in this competitive win against the consumer device.\nIn another recent win, a regional health care system expanded their use of Zebra solutions replacing desk phones with our TC21 mobile computers and deploying TC52 mobile computers with our Workforce Connect application for instant clinical communications, including secure texting and calls. We continue to collaborate with this customer to explore additional solutions that can further optimize their operations.\nWe were also very pleased that Rakuten, a large third-party logistics provider, selected Zebra's autonomous mobile robots to improve the productivity of their warehouse operations. This fulfillment solution will improve picking efficiency, eliminating unnecessary steps for its frontline workers. The connectivity of the associates through wearable technology increases the ability to share prioritized tasks in real time to create additional efficiencies.\nIn closing, we continue to be very excited about our growth prospects. The pandemic has accelerated trends that drive Zebra's vibrant markets, including digitizing the health care patient journey e-commerce adoption and real-time track and trace across the supply chain. We are working diligently to navigate through near-term industry-wide supply chain challenges and to satisfy strong customer demand for our solutions. Now I'll hand the call back over to Mike.\n\nMichael A. Steele\n\nVP of IR, Zebra Technologies Corporation\n\nThanks, Anders. We'll now open the call to Q&A. (Operator Instructions)."

Steele\n\nVP of IR, Zebra Technologies Corporation\n\nGood morning, and welcome to Zebra's Third Quarter Conference Call. This presentation is being simulcast on our website at investors.zebra.com and will be archived there for at least 1 year.

Following the prepared remarks, Jo Heel, our Chief Revenue Officer, will join us as we take your questions. Now let's turn to Slide 4 as I hand it over to Anders.\n\nAnders Gustafsson\n\nCEO & Director, Zebra Technologies Corporation\n\nThank you, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. For the quarter, we realized a sales decline of 3%, and adjusted EBITDA margin of 21.1%, a 60 basis point decrease; and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $4.12, a 9% decrease from the prior year. We were unable to fulfill all orders due to supply chain challenges related to persistent component shortages for certain products as well as disruption in the transition to our new North American distribution center in the Chicago area. These challenges led to lower throughput than planned late in the quarter. This, along with orders from some large customers being deferred contributed to the lower-than-expected results.\nIn North America and EMEA, cycling 2 prior year large mobile computing deployments and suspension of sales in Russia resulted in the sales declines. Our Asia Pacific and Latin America regions were bright spots in the quarter with double-digit sales growth. Globally, we realized sales growth with our small and medium-sized customers which was more than offset by a decline from our large customers. From a solutions offering perspective, we drove growth across data capture, printing, supplies, services and software. These helped to partially offset the sales decline in mobile computing. We expanded gross margin over the prior year despite significant FX pressure, yet EBITDA margin contracted and EPS declined due to the deleveraging of operating expenses from the sales decline.\nWe have initiated meaningful actions to address the supply chain challenges, which was the primary driver for our results. These include organizational changes and the reallocation of resources to drive improved focus and execution in our supply chain, initiating specific actions with our supply chain partners to improve operations and extending the planned transition of our North America distribution center to mitigate execution risk.\nCustomer demand and our order pipeline generally remains healthy, yet has slowed since late Q3. Given the macroeconomic uncertainty, we see elongated sales cycles and certain projects being deferred. As a result, we are taking a cautious approach to our Q4 sales outlook and expense management while working to rightsize our working capital levels in the coming quarters to improve free cash flow conversion.\nAt the same time, we continue to prudently invest in initiatives that advance our solutions offerings. With that, I will now turn the call over to Nathan to review our Q3 financial results in more detail and discuss our fourth quarter outlook.\n\nNathan Andrew Winters\n\nCFO, Zebra Technologies Corporation\n\nThank you, Anders. Let's start with the P&L on Slide 6. In Q3, adjusted net sales declined 4%, including the impact of currency and acquisitions and down 3.2% on an organic basis, primarily due to supply chain challenges and lower sales to large customers. Our Asset Intelligence & Tracking segment increased 12.4%, driven by double-digit growth in both printing and supplies as product availability has continued to generally improve.\nEnterprise Visibility & Mobility segment sales declined 8.8% due to supply chain bottlenecks, including component shortages. We realized particularly strong growth in data capture solutions, including RFID and as well as rugged tablets. We also drove growth across services and software with strong service attach rates and attractive software offerings.\nPerformance was mixed across our regions. Asia Pacific sales grew 20% with broad-based strength across the region, including China. Latin America sales increased 10% with exceptional growth in Mexico. And in North America and EMEA, sales decreased 9% and 2%, respectively, due to the supply chain challenges, lower sales to large customers and the suspension of sales in Russia.\nAdjusted gross margin increased 80 basis points to 45.8% and due to favorable business mix and lower premium supply chain costs, partially offset by unfavorable FX. Adjusted operating expenses increased due to acquisitions and delevered by 60 basis points due to the sales decline. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 21.1%, a 60 basis point decrease from the prior year period due to expense deleveraging on lower sales. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $4.12, a 9.5% year-over-year decrease.\nTurning now to the balance sheet and cash flow highlights on Slide 7. For the first 9 months of 2022, we generated $170 million of free cash flow, which was significantly lower than last year, primarily due to a higher use of working capital due to elevated inventory and sales volume shifting to later in the quarter, higher incentive compensation payments given our exceptional 2021 performance and $90 million of previously announced settlement payments.\nWe made $50 million of share repurchases and invested $6 million in venture investments in the third quarter. We ended the quarter at a comfortable 1.7x net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio and with more than $1.2 billion of capacity on our revolving credit facility. On Slide 8, we highlight that premium supply chain costs have improved from peak levels. The actions we have taken to redesign products, targeted price increases as well as the improving freight capacity have enabled us to reduce purchases on the spot market and reduce the freight cost impact. We are on plan to move printer shipments to ocean from air late this year and into early 2023.\nFor the full year 2022, we now expect approximately $190 million of premium supply chain costs over pre-pandemic 2019 levels, a $10 million reduction from our prior outlook. In Q3, we incurred premium supply chain costs of $30 million as compared to the pre-pandemic baseline, which was favorable to what we had anticipated in our prior outlook.\nIn total, Q3 transitory items had a combined favorable gross margin impact of $14 million year-over-year. And in Q4 are expected to be approximately $35 million, which is a nearly $30 million reduction year-on-year.\nLet's now turn to our outlook. Q4 sales are expected to be approximately flat from the prior year period, with a range of negative 2% to positive 1% growth. As compared to our prior outlook, the lower sales growth is driven by softening demand, continued supply chain challenges and currency headwinds. We are confident in this guide given our relatively strong order backlog, improved quarter-to-date shipment activity and actions taken to stabilize North American distribution.\nWe estimate a 2-point additive impact from recently acquired businesses and a 4-point negative impact from foreign currency changes. As a reminder, approximately 25% of our global sales are denominated in euros. We anticipate Q4 adjusted EBITDA margin to be between 22% and 23%, which is an increase from both the prior year and the prior quarter. Given our tempered view of the demand environment, we are taking a conservative approach to managing operating expenses while preserving strategic growth investments.\nNon-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $4.50 to $4.80. We now expect our free cash flow to be at least $400 million for the year, which we have significantly reduced from our prior outlook due to lower profits and elevated inventory levels that we will be working down into 2023 as we rationalize safety stock and execute on our North America distribution transition. Sales seasonality has improved to more normalized levels in Q4, which should drive the peak cash flow quarter for 2022.\nPlease reference additional modeling assumptions shown on Slide 9. With that, I will turn the call back to Anders to discuss how we are advancing our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision with our customers.\n\nAnders Gustafsson\n\nCEO & Director, Zebra Technologies Corporation\n\nThank you, Nathan. The long-term fundamental drivers of our business remain strong. Slide 11 illustrates how we digitize and automate the front line of business by leveraging our industry-leading portfolio of products, software and services.\nBy transforming workflows with our proven solutions, Zebra's customers can effectively address their complex operational challenges, which have been magnified through the pandemic. This value proposition resonates with customers in any macroeconomic environment as it improves productivity and inventory accuracy among an extensive list of other operational benefits.\nAs we have expanded our portfolio with compelling solutions, we have elevated our strategic position with our customers. Our trusted relationships with our partners across the globe augment our capabilities, enabling us to serve more customers worldwide. Our new fixed industrial scanning and machine vision solutions resonated well with customers and partners at recent trade shows in Stuttgart, Germany and Boston, Massachusetts.\nOur booths featured advanced optical character recognition supported by deep learning capabilities gained through our 2021 Adaptive Vision acquisition. Our comprehensive offering has put us in a strong competitive position.\nNow turning to Slide 12. Businesses partner with Zebra to optimize their end-to-end workflows as they strive to meet the increasing demands of consumers. Zebra solutions continue to represent a necessary investment, and I would like to highlight several recent key wins across our end markets.\nA large North American retailer recently selected Zebra's TC52 mobile computers for their stable network connection, durability and camera performance. This customer maximizes value from Zebra solutions by combining our mobile computers with our Reflexis workforce and task management, Zebra Prescriptive Analytics and Intuit software. This combination enables the retailer to improve inventory accuracy and the omnichannel shopping experience for their customers.\nA North American-based fast-food chain has chosen Zebra's handheld RFID solution to enhance inventory management. This solution will enable each restaurant to reap the benefits of a more digitized supply chain by streamlining the process to track and trace inventory from its suppliers to the restaurant. Adoption of this technology will assist the customer to comply with the Food Safety Modernization Act.\nA transportation company in Europe has begun rolling out approximately 20,000 mobile tablets to streamline their vehicle rental process. Zebra's exceptional service and integrated product offerings displaced a competitor and will enable associates to complete vehicle workarounds inspections in the reservation process more efficiently. The convenience store chain in Latin America is expanding their use of Zebra solutions from the distribution center to the front of store with more than 50,000 Zebra mobile computers, printers and tablets.\nDeployment of these Zebra solutions is expected to significantly increase productivity, inventory accuracy and improve shopper satisfaction. Zebra's Mobility DNA software, which enables intuitive device management and our compelling customer value proposition were key differentiators in this competitive win. Apparel manufacturer, BMC, recently selected Zebra's autonomous mobile robots and fixed industrial scanners for their new 50,000 square foot North American facility.\nZebra collaborated with a major partner to develop a solution that would enable a flexible workflow and enhanced visibility along each step of the production line. By combining our autonomous mobile robots and fixed industrial scanners, BMC will realize powerful synergies with scanners tracking each step of production in directing the robots along the workflow. The robots streamline associates movements enabling faster fulfillment. This flexible and scalable solution was preferred to a traditional fixed conveyance system because it saves vital warehouse space and adjusts to demand.\nAdditionally, we recently secured a large win with a major European retailer who selected Zebra's fixed industrial scanners to significantly reduce scan time, increasing throughput at several thousand packing stations, resulting in a faster than 1-year payback on investment. Zebra's collaboration with the customer and a valued partner was integral to this competitive win.\nAs we turn to Slide 13, I want to reiterate the actions we have taken to address our challenges with North American distribution, elevated inventory levels and increased macroeconomic headwinds. We have executed key organizational changes and have initiated specific actions with our supply chain partners to stabilize operations and reallocate resources to address immediate challenges.\nWe are also taking decisive steps to rationalize inventory while maintaining optimal levels of strategic components. Additionally, we are taking prudent cost actions as we realized softening demand and implementing additional pricing actions to address FX and inflation. In closing, we continue to be very optimistic about the prospects and opportunities for our business. We have the broadest portfolio of tailored solutions to enable our customers to improve their operations in any environment.\nThe global labor deficit and on-demand economy have escalated the need for enterprises to digitize and automate their operations with our solutions. Now I will hand the call back over to Mike.\n\nMichael A. Steele\n\nVP of IR, Zebra Technologies Corporation\n\nThanks, Anders. We'll now open the call to Q&A. (Operator Instructions)."

[Operator Instructions]\nPlease note, this event is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Mike Steele, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nMichael A. Steele\n\nVice President-Investor Relations, Zebra Technologies Corp.\n\nGood morning, and welcome to Zebra's second quarter earnings conference call. This presentation is being simulcast on our website at investors.zebra.com and will be archived there for at least 1 year.\nOur forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially, and we refer you to the factors discussed in our SEC filings.\nDuring this call, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures as we describe our business performance. You can find reconciliations at the end of the slide presentation and in today's earnings press release.\nThroughout this presentation, unless otherwise indicated, our references to sales performance are year-on-year and on a constant currency basis.\nThis presentation will include prepared remarks from Bill Burns, our Chief Executive Officer; and Nathan Winters, our Chief Financial Officer. Bill will begin with a discussion of our second quarter results. Nathan will then provide additional detail on the financials and discuss our third quarter and revised full year outlook. Bill will conclude with progress on advancing our strategic priorities. Following the prepared remarks, Bill and Nathan will take your questions.\nNow let's turn to Slide 4 as I hand it over to Bill.\n\nWilliam J. Burns\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cross Country Healthcare, Inc.\n\nThank you, Mike. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Our teams executed well in the second quarter, delivering sales and earnings results above the high end of our outlook. For the quarter, we realized sales of $1.2 billion, approximately flat to the prior year, and adjusted EBITDA margin of 20.5%, a 70 basis point decrease, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.18, a 3% decrease from the prior year.\nAs we discussed in our last earnings call, during the first quarter, we began to see modest recovery in retail and e-commerce. In the second quarter, we saw signs of momentum across other end-markets, including health care, where we realized double-digit growth.\nMobile computing returned to growth across each of our vertical end-markets, led by health care and region. The growth in mobile computing was offset by declines across our other major product categories where year-on-year comparisons are more challenging, and we are in earlier stages of recovery. Services and software saw a modest growth in the quarter.\nWhile we are encouraged by early momentum in demand, we continue to see cautious spending behavior from our customers on large deployments, which have not yet returned to historical levels.\nAnother highlight was our sequential improvement in profitability due to improved gross margin and the benefits of our restructuring actions. Our plan to deliver $120 million of net annualized operating savings is on track and substantially complete.\nGiven our second quarter performance, progress on our cost actions and early signs of momentum in demand, we are raising our full year outlook for sales and profitability.\nI will now turn the call over to Nathan to review our Q2 financial results and discuss our revised 2024 outlook.\n\nNathan Andrew Winters\n\nActing CFO, Zebra Technologies Corporation\n\nThank you, Bill. Let's start with the P&L on Slide 6. .\nIn Q2, total company sales were approximately flat, reflecting early signs of momentum in demand beyond retail and e-commerce. Our Asset Intelligence & Tracking segment declined 14.4%, primarily driven by printing and RFID on challenging prior year comparisons.\nEnterprise Visibility & Mobility segment sales increased 8.2%, with double-digit growth in mobile computing, partially offset by a decline in data capture solutions. We saw modest growth in services and software.\nPerformance was mixed across our regions. In North America, sales decreased 7% with fewer large orders in retail and transportation and logistics, partially offset by strong growth in health care. In EMEA, sales increased 10%, driven by mobile computing. In Asia Pacific, sales declined 3% with continued weakness in China and challenging compares in Australia and Japan, partially offset by growth in Southeast Asia. The sales increased 7% in Latin America, led by Brazil.\nFrom a sequential perspective, total Q2 sales were slightly higher than Q1, with growth in nearly all product categories as we realized modest improvement in demand throughout the quarter in manufacturing, health care and transportation and logistics.\nAdjusted gross margin increased 60 basis points to 48.6% as we benefited from cycling premium supply chain costs in the prior year and favorable FX. Adjusted operating expenses as a percent of sales increased 110 basis points. This was driven by normalized incentive compensation expense, partially offset by approximately $25 million of incremental net savings from our restructuring actions. This resulted in second quarter adjusted EBITDA margin of 20.5%, a 70 basis point decrease versus the prior year and a 60 basis point sequential improvement from Q1. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $3.18, a 3.3% year-over-year decrease.\nTurning now to the balance sheet and cash flow on Slide 7. In the first half of 2024, we generated $389 million of free cash flow as we drove improvements in working capital. We ended the quarter at a 2.4x net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio, which is within our target range. And we had approximately $1.5 billion of capacity on our revolving credit facility as of quarter-end.\nWe diversified our capital structure during the second quarter by issuing $500 million of senior unsecured notes, while retiring the receivable financing facility that matured in May. We also terminated our remaining interest rate swap agreements for $77 million of cash proceeds. We have been prioritizing debt paydown and now have increased flexibility given our lower debt balance and improved cash flow.\nLet's now turn to our outlook. For Q3, we expect sales growth between 25% and 28% compared to the prior year. This outlook assumes continued stability of demand trends across our major product categories, with broad-based growth as we cycle easier compares across the business, including significant destocking activity by our distributors during the second half of last year.\nWe entered the third quarter with a solid backlog and pipeline of opportunities. That said, we are not anticipating an increase in large order activity being the conversion rates on our pipeline remain lower than historical levels as customers continue to be cautious in what remains an uncertain environment. We would like to see additional momentum in large orders before factoring in a stronger recovery.\nQ3 adjusted EBITDA margin is now expected to be between 20% and 21%, driven by expense leveraging from higher sales volume, with benefits from restructuring actions, partially offset by normalized incentive compensation expense. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $3 to $3.30.\nWe have raised our guidance for the full year, reflecting our second quarter performance and early signs of momentum in demand. We now expect sales growth between 4% and 7% for the year, and adjusted EBITDA margin to be in the range of 20% to 21%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share are now expected to be in the range of $12.30 to $12.90. Free cash flow for the year is now expected to be at least $700 million. We have been making progress rightsizing inventory on our balance sheet and improving cash conversion. Please reference additional modeling assumptions shown on Slide 8.\nWith that, I will turn the call back to Bill.\n\nWilliam J. Burns\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cross Country Healthcare, Inc.\n\nThank you, Nathan. Zebra is well positioned to benefit from secular trends that support our long-term growth. These include labor and resource constraints, track and trace mandates, increased consumer expectations, and the need for real-time supply chain visibility. We help our customers digitize their environments and automate their workflows through our comprehensive portfolio of innovative solutions, including purpose-built hardware, software and services. We empower frontline workers to execute tasks more effectively by navigating constant change in real time through advanced capabilities, including automation, prescriptive analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence.\nAt our Innovation Day event in May, we demonstrated how we transform workflows across the supply chain to drive positive outcomes for enterprises across our end-markets. Our products and solutions are mission-critical to enable visibility that consumers and enterprises now expect throughout the entire supply chain.\nOn Slide 11, you will see Zebra solutions can touch a product 30x from its origination to the point of last-mile delivery. Let's briefly walk through the journey with a few high-level examples.\nIn manufacturing, our machine vision solutions provide quality inspection and track and trace visibility throughout the process. In a warehouse, our wearable mobile computers, autonomous mobile robots and comprehensive RFID portfolio transform receiving, picking and shipping. As the product arrives at a store, associates are equipped with Zebra software running on our mobile computers to assist customers stock inventory and fulfill online orders. And when an item is delivered to your home, you receive a notification and picture from Zebra's handheld device verifying on [indiscernible] delivery.\nAs you'll see on Slide 12, our customers leverage our solutions to optimize workflows across a broad range of end-markets. We empower enterprises to drive productivity and better serve their customers, shoppers and patients. We are seeing Zebra's competitive differentiation in mobile computing solutions drive wins across our vertical end-markets. Customers value the capabilities we embed in the software layer of our devices that they leverage to transform workflows and improve outcome.\nFor example, we secured a mobile computing win with a commercial airline utilizing our mobile package dimensioning solution enabled through AI. Also, a North American retailer will leverage Zebra's Workcloud collaboration software on their new wearable mobile computers, connecting their associates, to drive better outcomes in their stores. Additionally, we are able to displace consumer cell phones at a European retailer with our mobile computers and Zebra's Identity Guardian solution. It provides multifactor authentication for a shared device environment that brings security, productivity and convenience to the front line.\nIt is also notable that mobile computing contributed to double-digit sales growth in health care. Over the past year, our teams have been successfully selling the benefits of our solutions in clinical mobility that empower caregivers while delivering lower total cost of ownership for hospital systems. We have been displacing consumer cell phones with our devices, and there continues to be a long runway of opportunity for equipping more clinicians with mobile computers.\nIn closing, we expect to see broad-based growth in the second half to much easier comparisons and benefit from momentum beyond retail. We maintain strong conviction in our long-term opportunity for Zebra as we elevate our strategic role with our customers through our innovative portfolio of solutions. Our sales and cost initiatives have positioned us well for profitable growth as our end-markets continue to recover.\nI will now hand it back to Mike.\n\nMichael A. Steele\n\nVice President-Investor Relations, Zebra Technologies Corp.\n\nThanks, Bill. We'll now open the call to Q&A. We ask that you limit yourself to 1 question and 1 follow-up to give everyone a chance to participate."

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, February 7, 2022. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the conference over to Keri Mattox, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Chief Communications Officer. Please go ahead.\n\nKeri P. Mattox\n\nSenior VP of IR & Chief Communications Officer, Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. I hope you are all well and safe. Welcome to Zimmer Biomet's Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today are Bryan Hanson, our Chairman, President and CEO; and EVP and CFO, Suky Upadhyay.\nBefore we get started, I'd like to remind you that our comments during this call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Please note, we assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements even if actual results or future expectations change materially. Please refer to our SEC filings for a detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties in addition to the inherent limitations of such forward-looking statements.\nAdditionally, the discussions on this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included within our Q4 earnings release, which can be found on our website, zimmerbiomet.com.\nWith that, I'll now turn the call over to Bryan. Bryan?\n\nBryan C. Hanson\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc.\n\nAll right. Great. Thanks, Keri, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. I'm going to just give you an outline of how we want the call to proceed this morning. I'm going to spend the first part of the discussion briefly talking about our fourth quarter results. And I'm also going to spend a little bit of time talking about what we're seeing so far in 2022. I know it's early, but I want to give you a sense of what we're seeing already and then just speak more broadly about our views of 2022 as a whole.\nAnd then I'm going to turn it over to Suky, who's going to provide more detail on fourth quarter and obviously, more detail on our guidance going forward. And then finally, it will come back to me before we move to Q&A. I just got a few things I want to close out the prepared remarks with and then we'll again jump into Q&A.\nOkay. So first, let's start with Q4, and I'm going to break this into really 3 categories. The first will be around COVID impact in Q4 and how it compared to our expectations. The second will be around VBP impact and again, how that compared to our expectations. And then finally, just performance outside of those environmental impacts and how we performed there.\nOkay. So let's take a step back first. I think that will help. Just when we gave our updated Q4 guidance on our Q3 earnings call back in November, we actually outlined our expectations around how COVID and staffing pressure would likely impact our fourth quarter results. And unfortunately, our assumptions largely played out in the quarter.\nAs you probably remember, we felt that the pressure from the end of Q3 would continue into Q4. And thus, the overall pressure from COVID and staffing would actually accelerate from Q3 to Q4. And really, the big reason this played out, of course, we know now is because of the Omicron surge that occurred towards the end of the fourth quarter. And as many have already stated, a lot of that impact truly came in December itself.\nSo what's interesting about this surge, though, is that even though the overall impact of COVID was about what we expected, the way it manifested was different, right? So ICU capacity was definitely a factor, but we did not see it as the primary driver of cancellations of procedures during the quarter.\nAnd so what we actually saw was more cancellations that occurred due to really either the patient or staffing member being diagnosed with COVID or actually having been around someone with COVID, and they were quarantining as a result and couldn't show up for the procedure. So that was really the shift that we saw in the quarter. So the overall impact was about what we expected, but the way, again, it manifested in the numbers was slightly different.\nOkay, so transitioning from there to VBP. Remember again on our Q3 call, we discussed what we thought the impact of China hip and knee VBP would be in our fourth quarter results. And we actually -- we were largely right on how that played out. And so our expected headwind in large joints was in line with the expectations that we had and also what we communicated to you. So that was pretty much in check when we think about large joints.\nNow what changed during the quarter, actually even post the quarter was that on January 24, the Chinese government announced that it was formally nationalizing one of its provincial trauma VBP tenders, and that was kind of new to us. But based on that confirmation from the Chinese government and really just our knowledge of how the VBP process will work from here, we did take a sales reserve in the fourth quarter, which obviously results then in a negative Q4 impact to both our net sales and adjusted diluted EPS.\nAnd what I'd say is that even though this trauma VBP adjustment came earlier than we anticipated, it is pretty consistent with the overall scale of the impact and consistent with our expectations and what we've been talking about more recently. Now I would say looking forward, the good news is we have a lot more visibility now. We're a lot smarter on the topic, and we understand what the impact of VBP will now be on our 2022 business. And that has been included in our guidance, which Suky's going to talk about in just a minute.\nOkay, so now looking past VBP and COVID in the fourth quarter, I'm very proud of the team when we focus on the things we can control. ZB's business execution against a challenging backdrop has been strong. Our strength of our team right now, that kind of one ZB culture, is as evident as it's ever been, and I think more important than ever. And the team has really been able to move our strategy forward even in these challenging times.\nAnd a few proof points to be able to point at, the team was able to drive continued strong demand and momentum for ROSA. And that is globally, not just in the U.S. but globally. We actually more than doubled the number of installed ROSAs in 2021 versus our cumulative total at the end of 2020. That's a pretty significant jump up, and again, speaks to the momentum that we have in robotics and orthopedics.\nAnd those ROSAs are paying off. In the fourth quarter, those installed ROSAs allowed us to reach 10% in total knee procedure penetration in the U.S. for the first time as a company. That's a huge milestone for the organization, and it's just the beginning of this ROSA journey for us.\nThe team also delivered a successful limited launch of the world's first and really only smart knee, the Persona iQ. Now it's early. Obviously, early days. We're in limited launch right now, as I said. But the launch trajectory feels great. The feedback is good, and we're looking forward to a full launch later this year.\nAnd then finally, and I think importantly, the team continues to execute in large joints across the board, driving again above-market performance in Q4 in the U.S. for both knees and hips versus 2019.\nOkay. So let's transition from Q4 and talk about what we're seeing so far in early 2022. And I'm going to speak specifically about COVID and staffing challenges. What I would tell you is that the challenges that we saw in Q4, in particular in December, are unfortunately continuing into January. And as a practice, and I think prudently so, our team is continuing to build our financial models using what I'm going to call a recency bias in those models.\nAnd as a result of that, we're expecting that December and really now January pressure in COVID and staffing will continue through Q1. So what we're basically saying is that overall, we anticipate that Q1 will likely be more pressured than Q4 was.\nAnd so what does that mean for our outlook for the full year? Again, we're going to follow that same approach. We're going to look at 2022 in a similar way, actually, in a very similar way in the way we gave guidance for Q4 of 2021. Until we see a fundamental shift in the current state and what's happening today in the environment, we are projecting that the COVID pressure will continue throughout the year and will be -- actually follow a similar peak and valley trend that we saw in 2021.\nAs I'm sure you can appreciate, given that about 80% of our revenues come from elective procedures, ZB must be highly attuned to this topic. And trust me, we are. We're highly focused in this area, and that has been captured in our assumptions for guidance.\nAnd with that, I'm going to transition to Suky to give you again more detail on Q4 and also our 2022 guidance. Okay, Suky?\n\nSuketu P. Upadhyay\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc.\n\nThanks, and good morning, everyone. For this morning's call, I'm going to focus on 3 topics: first, our Q4 results, including commentary on the impact of COVID; second, how that translates into full year '22 financial guidance that we provided this morning; and third, I'll provide a brief update on our longer-term outlook.\nMoving forward, unless otherwise noted, my statements will be about the fourth quarter 2021 and how it compares to the same period in 2020. And my revenue and P&L commentary will be on a constant currency or adjusted basis. We've also provided changes versus the fourth quarter of 2019 or prepandemic results as we feel it is an important comparison.\nNet sales in the fourth quarter were $2.04 billion, a reported decline of 2.3% and a constant currency decline of 0.8% or down 4.4% versus '19. On a consolidated basis, we were about flat through November versus 2019 and declined in December due to the Omicron variant surge.\nExpectations for the fourth quarter had contemplated the impact of China VBP in hip and knee, and that was largely in line with expectations. Separately, we booked the sales adjustment related to channel inventory for China VBP in trauma of approximately $30 million, triggered in part by the Chinese government's announcement relating to a national trauma VBP, which was made on January 24. This adjustment was about a 650 basis point headwind to S.E.T. category growth and about a 150 basis point drag on consolidated Q4 growth.\nIn short, excluding the impact of the China VBP on our S.E.T. results, the quarter was generally in line with the assumptions that we provided on our third quarter call and broadly consistent with the midpoint of our implied fourth quarter guidance range.\nThe Americas declined 1.5% in the fourth quarter, down 1.9% versus 2019, with the U.S. declining 2.3% or down 2.4 versus 2019. The impact of Omicron late in the quarter, in tandem with lingering hospital staffing challenges, drove lower regional results.\nEMEA grew 17.3% or down 3% versus '19. The region experienced positive growth versus '19 earlier in the quarter, but quickly decelerated with the emergence of Omicron.\nLastly, Asia Pacific declined 17.5% or down 15.1% versus '19 driven primarily by price adjustments on channel inventory ahead of hip, knee and trauma VBP as well as some negative impact from a spike in COVID cases starting in December in markets like Japan and Australia.\nNow turning to our business category performance in the fourth quarter. The global knee business increased 0.4% or down 3.9% versus 2019 with U.S. knees declining 5.2% or 3.9% versus '19. In the quarter, China VBP had a negative impact on knee growth of about 250 basis points.\nOur global hip business declined 2.8% or down 6% versus '19, with U.S. hips declining 4.4% or 3% versus '19. VBP impact on hip was about 700 basis points in the quarter.\nOur sports, extremity and trauma category decreased 4.3% or down 6.2 versus '19. The sequential deceleration was due to a softer market due to COVID and the impact of China National VBP in trauma, as discussed earlier. Excluding the impact of trauma VBP in the quarter, S.E.T. was growing low single digits versus 2020 and about flat versus '19 on an underlying basis.\nThe dental and spine category declined 3% or down 3.8% versus '19, with dental posting growth and spine declining primarily due to continued pressure from COVID.\nFinally, our other category grew 14.1% or up 1.9% versus '19. Inside this category, we saw ongoing demand for ROSA Knee as well as increased revenues from the launch of our ROSA Partial Knee and hip applications.\nMoving on to our P&L. For the fourth quarter, we reported GAAP diluted loss per share of $0.40 compared to our GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.59 in the fourth quarter of 2020. This decrease was driven primarily by lower revenue, a debt extinguishment loss recognized on our bond tender offer, litigation-related charges and restructuring charges that we incurred in Q4 to continue to address pressures on revenue from COVID and the stranded costs associated with the spin.\nOn an adjusted basis, diluted earnings per share of $1.95 represented a decline from $2.11 in the fourth quarter of 2020. The decrease was primarily from lower revenues in tandem with lower gross margins due to COVID-19 and the impact of China VBP in both recon and trauma, which were partially offset by targeted reductions in SG&A and a slightly lower tax rate. In addition, FX was a modest headwind to earnings per share in the quarter.\nAdjusted gross margin was 69.1%. Fourth quarter gross margin was pressured due to lower manufacturing volumes and the impact of China VBP. For the full year, adjusted gross margin was 70.7% and in line with prior commentary.\nOur adjusted operating expenses of $882 million declined year-over-year. Inside of that, we continue to invest in R&D and commercial infrastructure across priority areas like S.E.T., robotics and data and informatics, which are being funded by accelerated improvements in efficiency across other areas of SG&A.\nOur adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 25.9%, down versus the prior year, but in line with the prior quarter. The adjusted tax rate was 14.4% in the quarter. Q4 and full year tax rates were favorable to our expectations due to some discrete onetime items in the quarter.\nTurning to cash and liquidity. Operating cash flows were $366 million, and free cash flows totaled $224 million with an ending cash and cash equivalents balance of just $480 million.\nWe continue to make good progress on delevering the balance sheet. In the fourth quarter, we reduced debt by approximately $400 million, bringing the total debt reduction in '21 to approximately $900 million, excluding the effects of foreign currency on non-U.S. denominated debt.\nMoving to our financial outlook for 2022. We are issuing '22 financial guidance based on the following key assumptions. COVID and customer staffing pressures are expected to continue throughout 2022. We expect the COVID and staffing pressures that we saw in December to accelerate into the first quarter of this year with the first half of 2022 being more pressured than the second half.\nWe do not see China VBP as a material impact to growth in '22 versus '21, but we expect variability by quarter with more pressure in the first half. Furthermore, we anticipate completing the spin of our dental and spine businesses in the near term. And as such, the guidance we are providing is only for RemainCo Zimmer Biomet.\nFor the first quarter, ZimVie will be reported as discontinued operations, and we expect to provide pro forma 2021 information for RemainCo on or around our first quarter earnings call. While we do not have full P&L restatements available at this time, for comparison, we have provided our unaudited net sales estimate of $6.827 billion for RemainCo Zimmer Biomet.\nAgainst this backdrop, our current expectations for the full year 2022 financial outlook are reported revenue growth in the range of negative 4% to 0 versus 2021 with an expected foreign currency exchange headwind of approximately 200 basis points. This translates to negative 2% to positive 2% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted operating profit margin of 26.5% to 27.5%, adjusted tax rate of 16% to 16.5%, adjusted diluted earnings per share in the range of $6.40 to $6.80 and free cash flow of $700 million to $800 million.\nInside of that guidance, we expect Q1 revenue to be flat to up slightly versus the first quarter 2021 due to headwinds from COVID and the impact of VBP being somewhat offset by the easier comp relative to the first quarter of last year and a roughly 130 basis point selling day tailwind that will largely be reversed in the fourth quarter. We expect approximately $160 million of net interest expense and approximately 212 million average shares outstanding for the year. We remain committed to our investment grade rating and expect to pay down $750 million of debt maturing in the second quarter of this year.\nNow turning to our longer-term outlook. With the ZimVie spin transaction nearing completion, we are also taking this opportunity to update our long-term margin expectations. Given the prolonged impact COVID-19 is having on our business, we are removing our target of at least 30% adjusted operating profit margin exiting 2023. However, we do expect to improve margins over the long term as we will continue to make targeted investments in our business to enhance top line growth while also accelerating cost savings to fund those investments.\nIn summary, the macro environment presents challenges, but our underlying business fundamentals remain strong as we continue to execute successfully against what we can control.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to Bryan.\n\nBryan C. Hanson\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc.\n\nAll right. Thanks, Suky. And before we move into the Q&A session, I just want to spend a few minutes to talk about our broader corporate strategy and really importantly, our execution against that strategy.\nWhen I joined ZB, we looked very closely at number one, reimagining our corporate mission and culture; but also number two, making sure that we transform the long-term strategy of the company and change the way we think about innovation. And that was really where that ZBEdge ecosystem has come from.\nSo through that, we prioritized R&D spend in robotics and data. And we also tripled the number of ZB team members with robotics and data background so that we had that competency to truly move the needle in this area. And where we didn't want to build a competency, we forged strategic partnerships with the likes of Canary to be able to drive traction in smart implants, but also with larger players like Microsoft and Apple to further enhance our data and robotics ecosystem.\nAnd hey, we're seeing results. Our Vitality index has nearly doubled from 2018 to 2021. And I'm proud to say that our new product pipeline is stronger than ever. And as a result of that, we expect to increase our Vitality index an additional 50%, 5-0 percent over the strat plan period.\nBut beyond innovation in our strategy, we're also transforming the company by modernizing and streamlining its operating model, right? We're focused on accelerating and expanding programs to drive efficiencies in the company, simplifying the company and using that cost savings to enable investment in the business for growth but also positioning us to expand margins, and that will absolutely continue.\nAnd that reinvestment is working. That reinvestment in our business for growth is working. It is driving growth, and I know that COVID is hiding that growth. But if you go back in time before the disruption of COVID, we went from 0% growth in 2017. And believe me, I acutely remember this because I joined the company in December 2017, but we went from 0% growth in 2017 to a 3.2% growth rate in Q4 of 2019. And that was the last full kind of pre-COVID quarter that we had. And that was really just on the beginning end of that Vitality index moving north, just -- we're just getting traction in Vitality index.\nSo I would say that even though COVID disruption is definitely muting our growth, there's no question that, that's happening, we're confident that we have the right strategy, and we're executing against that strategy. So we have a differentiated portfolio, and that's even getting stronger because of our Vitality index movement. And our execution capability will allow us to pull that all together so that we can get back on that growth trajectory as we see recovery from COVID, okay?\nAnd so one last point that I want to make in our transformation, I want to talk about active portfolio management. Today, we gave an update on our ZimVie spin progress, and we're expecting to finalize the spin ahead of schedule on March 1.\nAnd I'm very excited about the ZimVie Investor Day today. You're going to hear from its CEO, Vafa Jamali and the team that he's put together. I think you're going to be excited about what you hear. And I can tell you that both Vafa and I know that we are creating more shareholder value as 2 independent companies.\nFor ZB, for RemainCo, we get increased focus. We get enhanced revenue growth, and we get margin accretion. For ZimVie, they get to prioritize the investment in their dental and spine businesses in a way that we would not have. And that really enables them to build a stronger stand-alone business in those attractive markets.\nOf course, you're going to hear a lot more about ZimVie over the coming weeks, starting with the Investor Day today. But outside of ZimVie, we also continued to move our M&A strategy and our partnership strategy forward. We've done almost 20 different transactions between M&A and partnerships to be able to enhance our position in faster-growth categories.\nAnd we have, I know, much more to accomplish here. But even with the limited available capital that we've had given the COVID pressure, we're absolutely off to the right start.\nSo as you can tell, there's a lot happening at ZB. There's a lot that we're proud of, and there's a lot that will absolutely continue to fuel our transformation and ultimately, help drive our mission and very importantly, drive value for you.\nSo with that, I'm going to turn the call back to Keri, and we'll move to our Q&A session.\n\nKeri P. Mattox\n\nSenior VP of IR & Chief Communications Officer, Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc.\n\nThanks, Bryan. (Operator Instructions) With that, operator, may we have the first question, please?"

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Keri Mattox, Chief Communications Officer. Please go ahead.\n\nKeri P. Mattox\n\nVice President-Corporate & Investor Relations, AmerisourceBergen Corp.\n\nThank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. We're joining you from our Warsaw, Indiana headquarters and are happy to be with you today. Welcome to Zimmer Biomet's First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me are Bryan Hanson, our Chairman, President and CEO, EVP and CFO, Suketu Upadhyay and COO, Ivan Tornos. Before we get started, I'd like to remind you that our comments during this call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties.\nPlease note, we assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements even if actual results or future expectations change materially. Please refer to our SEC filings for a detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties in addition to the inherent limitations of such forward-looking statements. Additionally, the discussions on this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation of these measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures is included within our Q1 earnings release, which can be found on our website, zimmerbiomet.com. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bryan. Bryan?\n\nBryan C. Hanson\n\nEVP and President-Minimally Invasive Therapies Group, Medtronic Plc\n\nAll right. Thanks,Keri, and thanks to everyone for joining us on the call this morning. Hey, we don't get the opportunity to do this too often. So I'm going to take advantage of it. And I'm just going to start the call by simply saying this was a phenomenal quarter where pretty much everything went better than expected. And importantly, as a result of that momentum, we are significantly raising our full year top and bottom line outlook, which Suky is going to talk about in just a minute. With that said, and maybe taking a step back. For today's call, I'll talk more about our Q1 performance and the drivers of that performance. And then Suky will get into more details for the quarter and importantly, also our financial guidance for the rest of the year. And then we'll make sure that we save plenty of time for your questions, which we look forward to addressing. But before we do any of that, I just want to take a minute to speak directly and personally to the ZB team and really truly say thank you for yet again, you have delivered beyond our expectations. And I'm very proud of what this team is doing to navigate an environment that, while improving, there's no question it's improving, it is still fluid. And it presents us with challenges that, quite frankly, seen like daily challenges. And it is truly impressive how you're navigating that environment right now. And I'm very proud of the dedication, the resilience and the innovative thinking that you're bringing to your roles each and every day. It is truly making a difference.\nBut I'm most proud of how together and I do mean together, we are living the ZB mission to alleviate pain and improve the quality of life for people around the world. And as we know, we do that every 8 seconds, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, which is really what it's all about in the first place. So thank you. Thank you for what you do for ZB. Thank you for what you do for our customers and most of all, and most importantly, what you do for our patients, the patients that we serve every day.\nOkay. So let's take a look now at the first quarter. And as some of you may recall, coming into the year, our guidance assumed that Q1 would have the easiest comp of the year. But would also experience some headwinds from both staffing and COVID-related challenges that we felt would put pressure on elective procedures during the quarter. We also assumed that there would be a pretty high level of supply pressure in the first quarter. Our assumptions also believed that all 3 of these headwind variables would then improve throughout the year, providing less impact to the business. But then outside of the easy comp, Q1 would be pretty bumpy. Okay. So what actually happened in the quarter and why was it considerably stronger than we expected? Well, first and foremost, procedure recovery was much better than we anticipated, really having almost no material or meaningful impact from COVID or staffing challenges in the quarter. And second, we manage the supply constrained environment better than we originally anticipated. Make no mistake, supply is a real problem and it's putting pressure on the business. But this team has done an excellent job managing that environment, probably leveraging some muscle memory from the past. And then third, and I think really importantly, our team's execution and traction with our new product innovation is even stronger than we anticipated. And that's important because it's going to continue to provide benefit to the rest of the year. And so because of this, we saw another quarter of very positive year-over-year momentum in large joints. With our global hip and knee businesses growing approximately 13% and 18% on an ex FX basis. Our overall SET category grew more than 6%. Driven by strong low double-digit performance in our growth drivers in set, which we've talked about before, being sports, CMFT and upper extremities. And then this was partially offset, as expected, from headwinds from our Restorative Therapies business, where these headwinds will anniversary. And as you remember, these are reimbursement change headwinds that we have in that business, they should anniversary by the back half of this year. And then finally, our other category grew 11% in the quarter. So needless to say, it was a pretty strong quarter. The momentum is real in this business, and our confidence is extremely high. And there's good reason for this confidence. If we just think about this quarter alone, we officially launched our new cementless knee form factor at Persona OsseoTi and this is adding to the Persona family and really strategically rounding out that portfolio. And this new Kel-design tray is extremely versatile. It's anatomic because it is the Persona family, and it's stable. And it's the only need that you could do a cemented or cementless procedure with an interoperative decision possible for the surgeon. And that's a big deal. We believe that this will enhance the potential for cementless penetration because surgeons can go into a questionable bone quality procedure with the intent to use cementless, but then they have the ability to pivot back to cemented at the bone quality isn't there. And for this reason and a lot of other reasons, customer feedback so far has been extremely positive as we've launched this product.\nAnd as you may know, our cementless penetration is already in the mid-teens, but we believe that this can get to 50% or higher penetration. And we're excited about that. And we truly do believe that this premium product can accelerate that growth for ZB and is already doing so. It's still early days. Our full launch is planned for the middle of this year as more sets become available. Make no mistake, this is a real driver for not just our knee franchise but for the overall company. So we're very excited. As you remember, back in February, we also closed our acquisition of Embody, which is providing access to differentiated products and an innovative pipeline for our sports medicine business. And this investment helps expand ZB's presence in this very attractive high-growth market while also in that market, serving our customers and our patients better. And this, combined with a very strong innovation pipeline that we have in sports and the dedicated commercial channel that we put into place gives us continued confidence in our global sports franchise. And if you [ rack ] the AAOS meeting, you would have seen that we previewed our HAMR product, which is designed to ensure consistent and reproducible compaction for hip procedures while allowing the surgeon to dial up or dial back the force of the strike depending on the individual patient need. And this ability to be more personalized, actually differentiates HAMR versus other compaction devices on the market. So needless to say, we're excited about this differentiated product. We believe this could actually increase not only the consistency for surgeons, but also the procedure efficiency, which is really important right now. and our current expectation is to launch HAMR in the third quarter of this year. And if you just look at these combined products, this is actually building on other launches that we've talked about, the Persona iQ, Hip Insights, the Identity shoulder system. And in total, we've introduced more than 50, 5-0 new products from 2018 through the end of 2022, with the majority of those products coming in markets growing 4% or faster. And we're geared to continue that momentum. It doesn't stop here. with another 40, 4-0 planned product launches between this year and the end of 2025, again, with the majority of those products to be launched in 4%-plus growth markets. And this shift not only continues the transformation of our product portfolio, it gives us short-term revenue growth, but it also improves our weighted average market growth. And ultimately, as a result of that gives us more confidence that our markets and our portfolio mix positions the company for sustainable mid-single-digit growth. And with this kind of traction around our product pipeline, increasing strength of our balance sheet and our team members' ability to execute, ZB continues to be well positioned to deliver value today and in the future and achieve our mission as a company. And with that, I'm going to turn the call over to Suky to take a closer look at Q1 and our latest expectations for 2023. Okay, Suky?\n\nSuketu P. Upadhyay\n\nnullExecutive Vice President, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer\n\nThanks, and good morning, everyone. As Bryan mentioned, we had an excellent quarter with better-than-expected results. As a result of continued market normalization and the strength of our performance, we are increasing and narrowing our full year financial outlook. With that, let's turn to our results and updated full year guidance. Unless otherwise noted, my statements will be about the first quarter and how it compares to the same period in 2022, and my commentary will be on a constant currency and adjusted operating basis. Net sales were $1.831 billion, an increase of 10.1% on a reported basis and an increase of 13.2%, excluding the impact of foreign currency. As we noted on our last call, we had a selling day tailwind of about 100 basis points this quarter. Overall, the business benefited from faster-than-expected recovery of elective procedures, driven by the easing of staffing-related headwinds on normalization of cancellation rates and some backlog recapture.\nAlso, we benefited from lighter comps, strong commercial and supply chain execution and new product uptake. While we continue to face macro supply headwinds, our teams have been doing a great job mitigating these challenges. U.S. growth of 12.7% was well ahead of our expectations with elective procedure volumes recovering and procedure cancellation rates returning to pre-pandemic levels. International sales grew 14% and with EMEA growing ahead of expectations driven by faster recovery and strength across both developed and emerging markets. And in APAC, we saw some pressure in China as anticipated, but results were generally in line with our expectations. Turning to business category performance. Global Knees grew 18.2%, with U.S. growing 18.1% and international growth at 18.2% Specifically, we saw a strong uptake across the full Persona product portfolio and traction in all regions. We now have the Persona primary partial revision and OsseoTi cementless options rounding out our full product line. And we are seeing very encouraging results across that new cement form factor. This full Persona product line not only improves and enhances our product mix benefit, but also supports the continued utilization of ROSA and associated pull-through.\nGlobal Hips grew 12.9% with U.S. hips up 12.3% and international up 13.5%, driven by continued traction across the Avenir and G7 product lines, along with ongoing uptake of ROSA hip. And we are encouraged by the early impact of the Hip Insight launch. The SET category grew 6.4%, driven by continued strong performance across our key focus areas of CMFT, sports medicine and upper extremities, all of which grew in the teens. This was partially offset by lower growth in other parts of SET, which includes the reimbursement changes in restorer therapies that will anniversary mid this year. Finally, our other category grew 11.1%, partially driven by some larger orders in surgical products, which may not repeat over time.\nMoving to the P&L. For the quarter, we reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.11 compared to our GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.35 in the prior year. While investments in R&D and commercial infrastructure increased, net earnings were higher this quarter, driven by revenues, improved gross margins and losses in the prior year related to XMD. On an adjusted basis, diluted earnings per share of $1.89 represents a 17% increase from $1.61 in the first quarter of 2022. Adjusted gross margin was 72.8%, up 220 basis points from the prior year. These results were positively impacted by favorable mix related to large joints performance and foreign currency hedge gains. Excluding these items, underlying gross margin was broadly in line with our expectations. Related to inflation, we are seeing some incremental pressure from spot buying and contract manufacturing pricing. But overall, inflationary pressure has largely stabilized. Our adjusted operating margin for the first quarter was 28.4%, up 200 basis points, primarily driven by revenue, better gross margin and continued discipline around our investment profile. Interest and non-operating expenses of $46 million and our adjusted tax rate of 16.3% were broadly in line with our expectations.\nTurning to cash and liquidity. Operating cash flows were $308 million and free cash flow totaled $178 million. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of approximately $330 million. Now moving to our updated financial outlook for 2023. Based on strong Q1 results and our ongoing strong execution, we are raising and narrowing our full year 2023 outlook. Constant currency revenue growth is now expected to be 6% to 7% versus 2022. And with an expected foreign currency exchange headwind of 100 basis points. We are also updating our adjusted EPS guidance range, now expecting $7.40 to $7.50. While we initially gave color that adjusted operating margin would be flat to slightly better in 2023, our Q1 results in tandem with an improved rest of year outlook gives us the confidence that we will expand operating margins this year. We continue to expect interest and other nonoperating expenses, along with our tax rate to be in line with our previous commentary. Finally, we now expect free cash flow for the year to increase to a range of $1 billion to $1.1 billion.\nIn terms of quarterly cadence throughout the year, our expectations remain unchanged. Q1 will be the highest revenue growth quarter followed by Q4, which should benefit from improving supply and contribution from new and innovative products. As well as a selling day tailwind of about 100 basis points. Q2 and Q3 are expected to be lighter growth quarters given tougher comps and a net selling day headwind of about 100 basis points. Again, selling days will have a net neutral impact for the full year. We expect adjusted operating margin to largely follow revenue with second half operating margin being slightly better than the first half.\nIn summary, we delivered excellent top line results beating internal expectations in nearly every category, while posting very strong adjusted earnings performance. Our business is executing well. Our pipeline is delivering and our momentum is real. We feel very confident as we move forward. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Keri to start the Q&A."

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, May 3, 2022. (Operator Instructions).\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Keri Mattox, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Chief Communications Officer. Please go ahead.\n\nKeri P. Mattox\n\nSenior VP of IR & Chief Communications Officer, Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. I hope you are all well and safe. Welcome to Zimmer Biomet's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today are Bryan Hanson, our Chairman, President and CEO; EVP and CFO, Suky Upadhyay; and COO, Ivan Tornos.\nBefore we get started, I'd like to remind you that our comments during this call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Please note, we assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements even if actual results or future expectations change materially. Please refer to our SEC filings for a detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties in addition to the inherent limitations of such forward-looking statements.\nAdditionally, the discussions on this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included within our Q1 earnings release, which can be found on our website, zimmerbiomet.com.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Bryan. Bryan?\n\nBryan C. Hanson\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc.\n\nAll right. Thanks, Keri, and thanks to all of you for joining us this morning. I'm going to talk briefly about our Q1 performance and our revised expectations for the full year. I'm also going to spend a few minutes talking about our recent innovation and our key drivers for long-term growth, and then after that, I'm going to turn it over to Suky, who will get into more details on the quarter, but also very importantly, our full year guidance update. And then we'll close out the call with your questions, of course.\nSo let's get started with Q1, and we have a strong quarter, well above our own expectations and obviously, above external expectations. And the primary reason for that level of overachievement was stronger-than-anticipated COVID recovery in the quarter, particularly when we looked at the back half of the quarter. And if I look at the U.S. recovery, it was stronger and faster than I think anyone expected, pretty much across the board.\nAnd while we continue to see COVID surges in EMEA and China, the impact on overall procedure cancellations has been minimal at least so far. And inside of that, we saw a very strong performance in large joints and in particular, our knee franchise, while our set recovery lagged our core recon business at this point.\nWe know it's still early in the year, but based on what we saw in the quarter and really, current trends into Q2, our confidence in 2022 growth has definitely increased. And as a result, we are raising and tightening our full year guidance.\nNow, there are clearly a number of headwinds that we are facing, supply challenges, inflation, Russia, Ukraine, but given our revenue dependence on elective procedures, COVID recovery outweighs those headwinds. And that's why even in the face of these challenges, we're able to raise our outlook for the year.\nOkay, so turning the page a bit. Outside of external influences on our business, our strategy is working, and our underlying business is very strong. Our new product pipeline continues to deliver. We're adding more innovation and value to our ZBEdge ecosystem. If you were at AAOS, you saw our recently launched WalkAI. This is ZB's first AI-based solution. We also showed recently launched functionality for mymobility platform. This is under the umbrella of our exclusive partnership with Apple. Our ROSA Robotics momentum continues to be very strong, and the early feedback on Persona iQ, even though it's in limited launch, is very positive. All of these things combined are highlighting the possibilities around data collection and integration on the patient experience.\nWe also continue to drive significant demand and traction with Persona Revision in our knee franchise, with Avenir Complete and our hip franchise and our Signature ONE Planner in shoulder. And our new product pipeline remains very strong, with additional product launches planned for 2022, especially across our knee and S.E.T. portfolios.\nWe're also continuing to reshape our business and accelerate ZB's transformation. That means, of course, streamlining and modernizing our operating model, but also, focusing on making ZB a best and preferred place to work in a trusted partner. Now, just in Q1, we scored 100% on the Human Rights Campaign's Corporate Equality Index. We made Forbes' Best Large Employers list, and we were named one of the most innovative companies by Fast Company for our ROSA Robotics platform.\nWe have also prioritized our environmental, social and governance, or ESG commitments, and our actions in this area continue to expand. We have committed to key environmental standards, delivered on social giving pledges and set DE&I standards and long-term goals in this area. And we've enhanced our overall reporting of ESG progress internal to our own team members, but also, to investors.\nAnd finally, our transformation also includes, as you know, active portfolio management, and as a part of this, we completed our spinoff ZimVie on March 1. That was ahead of schedule and certainly is a part of our active portfolio management strategy.\nSo in summary, even though there are real macro headwinds that we will have to manage, and I have confidence in our team to do so, the recovery -- the shift in recovery really in COVID is the bright spot we've been waiting for and we're excited about and has certainly changed our view of 2022.\nAnd with that, I'm going to turn the call over to Suky for a deeper dive into Q1 and our revised expectations for the full year. Okay, Suky?\n\nSuketu P. Upadhyay\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc.\n\nThanks, and good morning, everyone. We had a good quarter driven by faster-than-expected recovery of elective procedures, giving us the confidence to raise our full year revenue and earnings per share outlook.\nLet's turn to our Q1 results and how that translates into our updated full year financial guidance. Unless otherwise noted, my statements will be about the first quarter 2022 and how it compares to the same period in '21, and my commentary will be on a constant currency and adjusted continuing operations basis. Please note, we have changed our geographic revenue reporting to U.S. and international and we released a Form 8-K last week to provide unaudited recasted financial information related to our ZimVie spinoff, as well as a change in non-GAAP reporting of in-process R&D related expenses.\nMoving to first quarter performance. Net sales in the first quarter were $1.663 billion, up 3.9% on a reported and 6.8% on a constant currency basis. As previously guided, selling days contributed about 130 basis points of tailwind in the quarter. Revenue was driven by continued execution along with stronger and faster than expected COVID recovery across most markets, with the largest uplift in the U.S. After significantly pressured January, recovery ramped through the quarter with improvement in February and a strong rebound in March.\nOn a consolidated basis, March grew versus pre-pandemic levels, and that recovery has continued into April. U.S. sales grew 5.8%, driven by strong recovery as COVID cases subsided and elective procedures returned. By the end of the quarter, U.S. cancellation rates have returned to pre-pandemic levels and procedure volumes were above 2019. International sales grew 8.1%, driven by strong growth across Europe, and we saw continued recovery despite COVID surges in certain European markets in China.\nTurning to our business category performance in the first quarter. As a reminder, China VBP is expected to be about neutral to overall revenue growth for the full year. And so far, the 2022 impact is broadly in line with our original expectations. While we don't expect a material impact from VBP on full year 2022 growth, we do expect there to be fluctuation by quarter. In the first quarter, we saw about a 200 to 300 basis points of pressure across our global knee, hip and S.E.T. segments, which we expect to be broadly offset through the next 3 quarters, with the majority coming in the fourth quarter.\nGlobal Knees grew 11%, with U.S. knees up 11.7% and international knees up 10.1%, driven by solid commercial execution, continued traction for Persona Revision, Robotics pull-through and strong knee procedure recovery across most markets. Global Hips grew 4.5%, with U.S. Hips up 3.3% and international Hips up 5.6%, driven by recovery in both primary and revision hip procedures, and we're seeing positive early traction on ROSA Hip. The sports and extremities and trauma category increased 1.8%, driven by strong performance in CMFT, sports medicine and upper extremities. And finally, our other category grew 11.5%.\nMoving to the P&L. For the quarter, on a continuing operations basis, we reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.35 compared to GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.92 in the first quarter of 2021. This decrease was driven primarily by an unrealized investment loss due to a decline in the value of our investment in ZimVie and higher litigation related and restructuring charges. On an adjusted basis, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.61 represents an increase from $1.55 in the first quarter of 2021. The increase was largely driven by higher sales and lower interest expense.\nAdjusted gross margin was 70.6%, lower than the prior year as expected due to VBP and higher input and manufacturing costs, which were partially offset by higher volumes and better mix. Our adjusted operating expenses were about $735 million, up from the prior year, driven by higher investments in R&D. Our adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 26.4%, down versus the prior year, but ahead of expectations and driven by higher revenue. The adjusted tax rate was 16.1% in the quarter, in line with our expectations.\nNow, turning to cash and liquidity. Operating cash flows from continuing operations were $360 million and free cash flow totaled $223 million for the quarter. We reduced our debt by about $650 million, excluding the effects of foreign currency and ended the first quarter with cash and cash equivalents of about $435 million. Our improving financial performance, in tandem with our ongoing debt reduction continue to strengthen our balance sheet.\nMoving to our updated financial outlook for 2022. While we continue to manage through macro headwinds related to foreign currency, Russia, inflation and supply chain challenges, a faster and stronger COVID recovery in tandem with a positive first quarter to give us the confidence to raise and tighten our financial guidance.\nAgainst this backdrop, our current expectations for the full year are as follows: on a constant currency basis, we now expect to grow 2% to 4% versus 2021, with an expected foreign currency headwind of approximately 350 basis points. This translates into a reported revenue growth projection in the range of negative 1.5% to positive 0.5% versus 2021. Note that the selling day tailwind that we saw in the first quarter will be fully reversed in the fourth quarter, with no material full year selling day impact.\nAdjusted operating profit margins continue to be in the range of 26.5% to 27.5%. This assumes inflationary pressure of about 150 basis points versus our original estimate of about 50 basis points. Of the incremental 100 basis points of pressure, a half will hit 2022, but be offset by expected higher revenue and roughly half will be capitalized and impact 2023.\nAdjusted tax rate expectations remain in the range of 16% to 16.5%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share is now expected to be higher at $6.65 to $6.85, and we are increasing free cash flow to $750 million to $850 million. Inside of that guidance, we have a tougher comp in the second quarter due to COVID recovery we experienced in 2021. But we do expect revenue to grow in the low single digits over the second quarter of '21, and to exceed pre-pandemic levels for the full quarter.\nIn summary, we expect that the environment will remain dynamic, but we believe the pace of recovery, our continued execution and the strength of ZB's underlying business fundamentals position us well to improve our financial outlook.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to Keri.\n\nKeri P. Mattox\n\nSenior VP of IR & Chief Communications Officer, Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc.\n\nThanks, Suky. (Operator Instructions) With that, operator, may we have the first question, please?"

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Keri Mattox Chief Communications and Administration Officer. Please go ahead.\n\nKeri P. Mattox\n\nVice President-Corporate & Investor Relations, AmerisourceBergen Corp.\n\nThank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Zimmer Biomet's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today are Ivan Tornos, our President and CEO; and EVP and CFO, Suky Suketu. Before we get started, I'd like to remind you that our comments during this call will include forward-looking statements.\nActual results may differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Please note, we assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements, even if actual results or future expectations change materially. Please refer to our SEC filings for a detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties in addition to the inherent limitations of such forward-looking statements. Additionally, the discussions on this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures.\nReconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included within our Q3 earnings release, which can be found on our website, zimmerbiomet.com. With that, I'll turn the call over to Ivan. Ivan?\n\nIvan Tornos\n\nChief Operating Officer\n\nThank you very much, Carrie, and good morning, and greetings everyone from Wars Indiana, the orthopedic capital of the world. Welcome to our Q3 earnings call, my first call as the CEO of this amazing organization, really grateful that all of you are joining us here this morning. I'd like to begin by saying how truly cared I am to be in the new role, what I deem to be a very inspiring time not just in musculoskeletal health, which it is, but also in Medtech in general.\nSimply put, the space is not what it used to be just so 5 years ago. When you look at orthopedics, when you look at the entire category, it's changed. It changed a lot. Groundbreaking technologies are shaping how procedures are done. Beyond the backlog and continued favorable demographics, global demand for treatment is higher than it has historically been. This is driven by better clinically reported outcomes. This is driven by shorter episodes of care. This is driven by better, more comfortable ways to do physical therapy. This is driven by growth in the U.S. with the rapid shift of cases moving to an ASC, while also preserving what are very compelling volume levels, in the traditional inpatient and outpatient savings.\nSo in plain English, healthy market, great patient dynamics, new technology, disruptive innovation, a lot has changed, and I don't see us going [indiscernible] to a 4, 5 years ago. So again, a very inspiring time to be in musculoskeletal health and orthopedics in general. All of these markets accelerating trends are opening new doors for countless patients to benefit from what we do here at CV, which is to drive life change in solutions. We do that every single day for countless patients. And the best part about it, we're just getting started.\nSo I could not be more excited to be here in my new role. With this encouraging market dynamics, sustainable trends and building on the solid track record of execution that the CV team has enabled. It's great to be here today to report what it is another solid quarter of strong performance while strongly reaffirming our year-end guidance for the year 2023. Even more exciting, as I look forward to our future, I'm more convinced than ever that Zimmer Biomet will continue to lead the way on customer-centric innovation, already a competitive advantage and solid commercial execution, enabling not just the delivery of mission but also improving on our other key value creation drivers, those regaining and sustaining top quartile performance. And again, this is something that we treat with a lot of rigor and something that is mandate for the organization. We must regain and sustain top quartile performance.\nFor today's call, I want to first share my thoughts on my first 2 months as CEO of Zimmer Biomet while also providing key insights into what I have learnt, how my learning has shaped, who are going to be my 3 key priorities as the new CEO of the enterprise. This would answer the question of what is fundamentally going to change around here in the next chapter for transformation.\nAfter that, I'm going to talk about the key drivers behind the solid Q3 performance. Next Sue will take over, and we'll discuss the financials for the quarter as well as the expectations for the rest of the year and then our February part of the call. Before we move into these updates, I do want to take a moment to thank the global Zimmer Biomet team for their unwavering commitment to our purpose, to our plans. I want to thank them for the sense of urgency in driving some execution. I want to think them for everything that they do. This is a highly engaged and focused team that has been operating at a very rapid speed and is eagerly deciding to do even more, more for patients, more for customers, more for the team, more for each other, more for the company, more for the communities where we work and live, like right here in Werson and frankly, far more for the shareholders.\nThis team gone through a lot, and a lot is a lot. This team has done a lot of heavy lifting. And now with a heavy lifting behind from a remediation standpoint. It's great to be in a different stage. And it's great to be able to show to the world what the Zimmer Biomet team can do and will do. I'm beyond proud of the organization, and I'm generally inspired by what they do each and every day.\nWe do this for a while around the world, and I can truly tell you I have never worked with a better team than the 1 we have here at Zimmer Biomet. And again, I can hardly wait to showcase our results in quarters to come. So thank you. I also want to say Brian Hanson for all the branded to bring Zimmer Biomet to this moment. We are grateful and we're stronger because of his leadership. So thank you, Brian.\nNow let me share some perspective as the new CEO of Zimmer Biomet. During my first 11 weeks or 77 days in the job, I've spent significant time with team members, customers, analysts, investors or Board, my peers, health care executives across med tech, government officials and other key stakeholders in health care, so that I could listen, I could learn and I could get the property insights. I've been in every Zimmer Biomet region around the globe have interactive with every key manufacturing facility. I have visited hundreds of decision makers across every major continent, and I have collected countless pages of feedback and recommendations.\nMost critically, obvious this reflection time, to ensure that we, at Zimmer Biomet are boldly prioritized what needs to get done. And this, I can assure you, will be a trademark of my time as CEO of Zimmer Biomet,having the courage to say no to several things so that we can become truly great in those things that will drive the most value for the enterprise and our key stakeholders. These key priorities are purpose and people, number one. We have a winning culture. We have the absolute best talent in the industry.\nIt has been a foundational priority for CV and will continue to be critical under my leadership, people, purpose, talent, culture. We have a very data-centric organization. We use the same level of data centricity to track how it is that we're doing with our human capital. To that end, we track level of engagement, development, DEI, engage span across different segments and geographies, high potential ratings and everything in between.\nI'm really excited to report that our most recent engagement survey, which we completed about 6 weeks ago deliver the absolute best scores in the history of the company. Let me say that again, the latest engagement score for organization, close to 20,000 employees showcase the absolute best scores in the history of the organization, frankly, going up across every single category.\nThis tells me that the team is energized. This tells me the team is ready. And this tells me that the team is about to unleash a lot of greatness for the organization. The second priority is to create and sustain a framework of operational excellence across the board. Simply put, it's about being great when it comes to running the business. This means simplifying what we do, where we play and how we play.\nThis means being courageous and bold about the choices that we make. It starts with being intention about driving sustainable revenue growth. We know this is the #1 driver of total performance. And we also know that innovation, customer-centric innovation and commercial execution are the 2 key drivers of sustainable revenue growth. So we will accelerate that. But at the same time, we're not going to forget that we can and will do better across the entirety of the P&L.\nWe're going to drive a culture of ownership by every single employee across the globe with all of us waking up every single day acting as key investors in the business and thinking of time and money as the key currencies of the organization. This means continuing to align our incentives with an even greater emphasis on best-in-class performance from both top and bottom.\nBy delivering on operational excellence as a mandate or mindset for the organization, we're going to enable, number one, revenue growth of at least 100 to 200 basis points of our market while growing earnings faster than revenue and free cash flow growing faster than the rate of earnings. Number two, operational excellence will enable best-in-class supply and operational outcomes by simplifying a rather complex operations, a manufacturing footprint. And then thirdly, operational excellence as a mandate is going to enable an agile, nimble and simplified company that can anticipate, can be proactive in successfully navigating market trends.\nSo again, operational excellence and mindset is going to deliver revenue growth of at least 100 to 200 basis points of a market while growing earnings faster than revenue and free cash flow faster than the rate of earnings while enabling best-in-class supply and operational outcomes by making Zimmer Biomet agile, nimble and a very simplified company that is proactive in what it does.\nBased on where we are as we close the year 2023, and based on our latest guidance, we're already on track to deliver the metrics that I mentioned above around revenue, earnings and free cash flow, the way we run the company, but we expect to do it again with even greater rigor in 2024. To that end, we look forward to hosting an Analyst Day. It's something we've not done ever since we measure 2 companies.\nAnd at the Analyst Day, we're going to be sharing more details on this thought that I have highlighted and the specific drivers of these goals. So this becomes truly the DNA of Zimmer Biomet. Third priority is about innovating and diversifying Zimmer Biomet into high-growth markets, table stakes. We must enter higher growth markets. We do need to diversify our portfolio. And we will do that. We're going to do it through organic and inorganic means. We're going to do it through innovation and M&A.\nOn the innovation front, we're going to innovate by continuing to boldly invest in the right segments of R&D. So that is new product development so that we always think customer problems and bringing solutions to those products. We're going to make sure that those projects are in attractive growth areas that are mission-centric but also are in the ride markets. And by bringing those solutions, we're going to become and remain market leaders in these categories where we choose to play, aided by more product and solutions launches that will enable category leadership for Zimmer Biomet.\nWe're going to be relentless about the CytoCare opportunities, namely the ASC opportunity here in the U.S., where we're already growing in the strong double-digit rates, but we know we're far from realizing true potential. This journey, by the way, innovation journey has already started. We then try to launch over 40 new products over the next 36 months, and the value -- the dollar value of our pipeline today it's twice the dollar value that we had back in 2018.\nSo a lot of new exciting technologies are about to get launched here at Zimmer Biomet. In addition, 80% of our products in our pipeline, we study markets that are growing at least 4% many in areas that are growing more than 4%. Equally viral, we're going to ensure that our innovation journey accelerates value creation through making sure that we're monitoring not just the revenue associated with these launches, the vitality index, but also what we call our innovation, profitability index, or IPI.\nAnd thus the gross margin dollars coming from new products. We've got to make sure that these new products are driving margin accretion to the overall margin profile of the organization. So again, it's about innovation and it's about value creation at the same time. Mission and margin expansion will coexist and will coexist as part of our innovation journey. To materially change our portfolio, we're going to also leverage the strength of our balance sheet, which is stronger than ever. We will do M&A. We're going to be thoughtful and disciplined about the spaces we prioritize.\nWe're going to ensure that the spaces are mission-centric. And at the same time, these patients are the areas where Zimmer Biomet has the right to win. We focus on opportunities that are going to hit strategic thresholds, but also hit financial thresholds. We're going to make sure that these acquisitions drive strong returns and create long-term shareholder value.\nIt is worth noting that this diversification of our business has started already. Yes, we have bolder and we will be bolder but it has already started. In the last 2, 3 years, we have shifted our portfolio already into mid-single-digit or above market environment, and our weighted average market growth rates have already increased from 50 basis points, and this happens through thoughtful resource allocation and some of the active portfolio management we've done.\nAgain, we're going to be bolder, but the journey has already started. I'm excited about where we can and will do a ports 3 priorities. It's about, first and foremost, people, human capital, having a best-in-class culture. Secondly, it's about delivering operational excellence as a company mindset or mandate and fairly is about making sure that we diversify and innovate in a far bolder way through organic and inorganic means.\nThose are the 3 priorities. So now that you got a better sense of our priorities, I want to talk about Q3. And again, I want to reiterate that we're really excited about the performance that we saw in the quarter. Performance that was driven by continued execution, especially in the key areas where we've been investing.\nIn particular, I want to talk about Niche, it was a great quarter for Niche, where we delivered a broad market performance in key markets around the world. We also grew in areas that are mission-critical within SEP, upper extremity CMFT as well as Sports Medicine. We had solid performance in the ASC environment, and we saw a revenue generation coming strongly from our data, technology and solutions platform, primarily within ROSA and now mobility. In Niche personal star highly are differentiated semenless platform continues to perform above our expectations. I was recently in Dallas at the hip any society, and the feedback continues to be super I can't wait until we continue to bring this technology to other geographies. ROSA had a strong quarter. I continue to see great adoption. We've seen a lot of ROSA adoption happening in the ASC setting, where speed we're dealing with higher volumes, that's matter.\nIn the ASC, we continue to see growth in the teams, and we're executing contracts daily or portfolios second to none, and we're benefiting from the recent acquisitions we've done, such as Embody and ReLine. Against the backdrop of this strong execution, med tech sector stocks have been facing pressure related to GLP-1 drugs and their impact or their perceived impact on obesity and this was a long-term perspective.\nWe're mission-centric pace in the bore organization. So if this drug class truly does accelerate and improves patient health. And if these drugs truly do become the end of the obesity pandemic around the world, that is great news for everyone as long as truly, this is sustainable in the long term. What I can tell you that we spend a lot of time researching GLP-1 drugs, engaging third parties, engaging thought partners and key opinion leaders across every major market and these GLP-1 drugs today become a [indiscernible] force. The [indiscernible] the root causes of osteoarthritis, a disease which impacts 528 million people around the world according to the World Health organization. The top stopes factors are ranking order, age, genetics and join injury.\nObesity certain accelerator of the disease and certainly is an element of the disease or a driver of the disease, but let's not forget that once the cartilage is damaged, there is no recovery. Once you get osteoarthritis, you will not get rid of osteoarthritis. And drop in weight is not going to cure osteoarthritis. Again, this is a generative and non-tenable disease that we're talking about.\nIf anything, obesity is a blocker today to join surgery as many surgeons are uncomfortable operating on patients with a BMI greater than 40 [indiscernible] countries or even above the 30 thresholds in some locations. So why could GLP-1s then be a tailwind for orthopedics, 3 compelling reasons. First, if you can lower the patient's BMI below a certain threshold 40 or 30 some cases, these patients now become eligible for surgery.\nAnd all the data points that we're getting in primary markets like the U.S. is that there is a large percentage of patients who today are not going through surgery because their BMI is too high. Secondly, if a patient does lose the way -- and I would say this is pretty logical. And they do become more active, there would be a greater risk for additional joint procedures because there will be injury.\nAnd third, if a patient loses wait, they are likely to live longer [Audio Gap] Minimal obesity rates but very, very long life expectancy dynamics. We don't see any near-term impact from GLP-1s, and we've seen the long-term impact would be a positive 1 for orthopedics and Zimmer Biomet. We've engaged independent third parties to perform surgeon surveys have gathered U.S.-based claims data. What it still is early in the process. We are very excited about the initial findings, and we look forward to sharing them.\nSo in a nutshell, more of a tailwind. We'll be sharing data very soon. We think that the logic will prevail, and this will be the end of what has been so far a rather emotional argument that is not being fact-based. In closing, I hope you can tell that I'm very confident about the future of this organization. I'm very excited to be here.\nOur end markets have never been stronger, and we believe that this market beyond the backlog is sustainable. Our execution is strong and is also sustainable. We've been delivering consistently for a while, and we'll continue to do so with even greater focus and speed. We know what we need to do.\nThe strategy is clear, and we will execute on the strategy. We have financial flexibility to invest in higher growth markets, and we are going to continue to shift our portfolio mix and diversify our business. I generally believe this is the time for Zimmer Biomet. I'm proud of what we've done and even more proud of the work that we're going to be doing ahead.\nThis is why I'm excited to be the CEO and even more excited to be a proud Zimmer Biomet shareholder as I believe that now is the time for real value creation. With that, I'll turn the call over to Suky for a run-through of our Q3 financials. Suky?\n\nSuketu P. Upadhyay\n\nnullExecutive Vice President, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer\n\nThanks, and good morning. I'd like to start my prepared remarks today by welcoming Ivan to his first earnings call as the Zimmer Biomet CEO. Ivan has been a constant force and a driver within the organization for several years, and I'm proud to work with him, and I'm excited by the partnership. As Ivan noted, we had another strong quarter driven by healthy and improving end markets, and continued strong execution across the organization. Overall, we remain on track to deliver mid-single-digit constant currency revenue growth and adjusted operating margin expansion in the back half of the year just as we committed to on our second quarter call.\nMoving to results. Unless otherwise noted, my statements will be about the third quarter and how it compares to the same period in 2022. And my commentary will be on a constant currency and adjusted operating basis. Net sales were $1.754 billion, an increase of 5% on a reported basis and an increase of 4.7%, excluding the impact of foreign currency. Additionally, we had a selling day headwind of about 150 basis points that impacted all regions and product categories at about the same level.\nExcluding the selling day impact, consolidated ex FX sales would have grown just over 6%. U.S. growth was 6% and international growth was 2.9%. In the U.S., our strong year-over-year results were driven by Recon and a step-up in our SET category in tandem with strong capital sales. Outside of the U.S., we saw more moderated growth across Europe and Asia, driven by tough comps and geopolitical headwinds, which I'll discuss in our product category section.\nGlobal Knees grew 7.3% with the U.S. growing 6.1% and international growing 9.1%. The strong performance in these was driven by continued uptake from our Persona product portfolio, combined with the benefits of our ROSA robotics platform. Global Hips declined by 60 basis points with the U.S. growing 3% and international declining by 4.2%.\nTough comps in China and headwinds in Russia disproportionately impacted our OUS hip business. Excluding these impacts, our international hip business grew in the low single digits. Looking ahead, portfolio expansion will continue to support growth in our hips business. Next, the SET category grew 2.8%. Again, as a reminder, there was about 150 basis point selling day headwind across all categories and regions.\nOur key focus areas within SET, including sports, upper extremities and CMFT, continued to post double-digit growth which was partially offset by other subsegments within the category. We remain confident that SET will grow in the mid-single digits in the fourth quarter. Finally, our other category grew 16.4%, driven by ROSA sales. Now moving on to the P&L. In Q3, we reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.77 compared to GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.92 in the prior year. While we had higher year-over-year revenue and higher pretax operating profits, post-tax income was lower due to a favorable tax settlement in 2022 that did not repeat this year.\nOn an adjusted basis, we reported diluted earnings per share of $1.65 compared to adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.58 in the prior year. The step-up is primarily driven by revenue growth in the quarter, partially offset by higher operating expenses and higher interest costs. Our adjusted gross margin was 70.9%, up 20 basis points from the prior year, primarily driven by favorable mix. Adjusted operating margin was 26.4% and up slightly versus the prior year.\nBetter gross margin and savings from efficiencies across SG&A were partially offset by higher R&D expenses that will support upcoming product launches, ultimately driving a continued increase in our Vitality Index. Net interest and other adjusted nonoperating expenses of $48 million was higher than the prior year due to certain foreign currency exposures as well as higher interest rates. And our adjusted tax rate was 16.7% in the quarter.\nTurning to cash and liquidity. We had operating cash flows of $338 million and free cash flow of $189 million in the quarter. We ended with cash and cash equivalents totaling just under $300 million. Our balance sheet remains strong, providing us financial flexibility and strategic optionality as we move forward. Now regarding our outlook. Overall, for 2023, the outlook remains largely unchanged from the prior quarter, implying over 7% constant currency revenue growth and 9% EPS growth at the midpoint of our range.\nWe expect reported growth for the full year to be 6% to 6.5% and are maintaining our ex FX growth expectations for the year of 7% to 7.5%. I Inside of that, the U.S. dollar has strengthened, so we are increasing our outlook for foreign currency to be about a 100 basis point headwind to revenue growth for the full year. Additionally, we are reiterating our EPS guidance of $7.47 to $7.57 for the full year despite the strengthening dollar, which we project to be about a $0.04 headwind to fourth quarter earnings.\nThis guidance implies that we will increase full year operating margins by about 100 basis points in the backdrop of a challenging environment. In addition to our formal guidance ranges, I will reiterate that there is no material impact from selling days on the full year revenue growth expectations. However, we do expect about a 100 basis point tailwind in the fourth quarter. Additionally, our expectations for interest and other nonoperating expenses as well as tax rate and shares outstanding remain unchanged.\nWe expect free cash flow for the year to be between $950 million and $1 billion. In summary, we delivered another excellent quarter on both the top and bottom lines. We remain confident in our 2023 expectations and are excited about the next year with revenue growing in the mid-single digits and earnings growing faster than the top line. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Keri.\n\nKeri P. Mattox\n\nVice President-Corporate & Investor Relations, AmerisourceBergen Corp.\n\nThanks, Suky. [Operator Instructions] With that, operator, may we have the first question, please."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, August 1, 2023. Following today's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Keri Mattox, Chief Communications and Administration Officer. Please go ahead.\n\nUnknown Executive\n\nThank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Zimmer Biomet's Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today are Bryan Hanson, our Chairman, President and CEO; and EVP and CFO, Suky Upadhyay; and COO, Ivan Tornos. Before we get started, I'd like to remind you that our comments during this call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties -- please note, we assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements even if actual results or future expectations change materially. Please refer to our SEC filings for a detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties and in addition to the inherent limitations of such forward-looking statements.\nAdditionally, the discussions on this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included within our Q2 earnings release, which can be found on our website, zimmerbiomet.com. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bryan. Bryan?\n\nBryan C. Hanson\n\nEVP and President-Minimally Invasive Therapies Group, Medtronic Plc\n\nAll right. Thanks, Kerri, and thanks to everyone for joining us on the call this morning. It's always good to be with you. But I would say it's even a little better and certainly more fun when we have great performance in the quarter. So we're pretty happy about the results that we get to discuss today, and I can tell you, we're looking forward to the dialogue. And I'll start things up, as we normally do, I'll talk about our Q2 performance and the key drivers inside of the quarter. But I think also really important is to talk about the key drivers that we see continuing to move this business forward.\nAnd then Suky will walk us through the financial details of the quarter and importantly, discuss how we are again raising our full year financial guidance. And then, of course, we'll close things out with a Q&A session, and we look forward to answering your questions and having a dialogue in that session. Okay. To kick things off, I'm just going to take a step back, which I've been doing now for the last handful of quarters and I think deservedly so, because I want to say thank you. I want to say thank you to each and every one of our team members around the world because it's your hard work. It's your dedication to getting the job done that is moving this business forward. And I will tell you that I'm proud to say that you have delivered another very strong quarter, while once again making ZB a certified great place to work. And you've done all of this while improving our scores and as a result of that, our rankings on the environmental, social and governance front.\nSo I think simply stated, we are doing well, while also doing good. And that means for our team members, our patients, our customers and our communities and even our planet. So once again, I want to say thank you to our team for all that you do for ZB and to move our mission forward. And most importantly, for doing it together as one team, one ZB team. Now let's talk about the second quarter.\nAnd I'm just going to say simply, we delivered another strong quarter, again beating our own expectations. And that performance positions us to again raise our financial guidance on both the top and bottom line. And this is in the face of some pretty significant macro factors that are impacting us in the entire market. Ongoing supply challenges are very real, and I'll talk about those in a minute, but also inflationary pressure, a tough labor market and the geopolitical landscape that is putting pressure on everybody. But against that, I feel very confident about our pipeline, our execution and the team's demonstrated ability to navigate these headwinds, which gives us confidence to increase our financial outlook. Okay.\nWith that said, let's talk about the key drivers inside of Q2, and there were some positives and there were some negatives. I'll start with the positives, and the most important one, in my view, is that our team's execution remains flawless. We're seeing significant traction, probably the best we've ever seen with our new product innovation. And that paid dividends in the quarter for sure, but most importantly, is it pays dividends as we move this business forward. And I would say that procedure recovery continued in the quarter, again showing no meaningful impact from COVID or staffing challenges, and that allowed for a tailwind from increased provider capacity, and that resulted in backlog pull-through in the quarter. In terms of headwinds, I would say that the team is doing a great job of managing the supply-constrained environment. But I would say that it is still very clearly a governor to our overall growth in the quarter, and it continues to be a distraction for the organization.\nSee if I combine these things, though, all in all, our momentum continues, and it continues to grow. And I've said before, my confidence in this business, our confidence in this business is as high as it's ever been. And it's high for a good reason. If you just look at the Knee franchise alone, our innovation strategy is working. We now have 4 meaningful pillars inside of this business. All of which can drive pricing stability, mix benefit and competitive conversions.\nFirst, let's look at the ROSA Robotic Platform combined with our Persona cementless Knee. This is a powerhouse combination that is and will continue to accelerate growth. And based on the traction we're seeing so far, we continue to believe that ROSA and Persona cementless together will enhance our robotics and cementless penetration from the current mid-teen level to 50% or better, 5-0% or better. The second pillar that we're focused on is Personal revision. This provides a meaningful conversion and mix opportunities inside the revision category. But importantly, it also acts as a powerful tip of the spear product for conversions and primary needs.\nAnd then third, it's just the overall shift of the ZB legacy Knee systems to our now fully rounded out Persona portfolio. And this is a meaningful mix benefit that we can take advantage of that, I would say, is somewhat unique to our business. And then fourth, on top of all this, we have the world's first and only Smart Knee which is Persona iQ. And I know this is still in limited launch, but already, it offers surgeons unparalleled data access and is attractive to patients, those patients who want more direct engagement with their care recovery. And we're taking on a similar approach to our hip portfolio where we continue to launch meaningful innovation, again, giving us the opportunity for price stability, mix benefit and competitive conversions. And we have 4 pillars of focus here as well.\nFirst, it's ROSA and Hip Insight. These are technology shifts in robotics in mixed reality that are setting up the ZB Hip portfolio for greater adoption and growth. Second is the Avenir Complete. This is our current flagship product combined with G7, which gives us a very strong position in both the attractive direct anterior and revision submarkets of Hip. And then third, this position will be enhanced with work being done on a triple taper STEM which will fully round out our direct interior approach portfolio.\nWe believe this new portfolio, combined with the G7, which is the most versatile acetabular component available will be unmatched in the industry. And then fourth, HAMR, this is our upcoming full launch of an automated impaction system that builds on a proven need in the market, and we fully expect that this launch will create surgical efficiencies while bringing personalized precision to each and every patient. And then finally, in set, we are being disciplined and targeting investment in our growth driver categories, Upper extremities, Sports and CMFT, and each of these categories continue to perform. And given our momentum in these businesses and continued investment in innovation and dedicated infrastructure, we fully expect the set business to be a mid-single-digit grower in a normalized market environment.\nSo overall, we're very excited about our innovation momentum. It's very real. Remember, we've called out that we have 40 planned product launches between this year and the end of 2025. And the majority in 4%-plus growth markets. And that's important because these innovations will certainly drive near-term growth. There's no question about that, but also create better sustainability of that growth because of the markets they're in. This portfolio shift that we're seeing and the team's execution capabilities are clear signs that our ZB transformation has taken hold. But I can tell you right now that we're not going to stop there. The goal is to continue to enhance our growth profile through our ongoing focus on active portfolio management, and that is supported by our already strong and strengthening balance sheet. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Suky for a closer look at Q2 and our latest expectations for the remainder of 2023. Okay, Suky?\n\nSuketu P. Upadhyay\n\nnullExecutive Vice President, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer\n\nThanks, and good morning, everyone. As Bryan noted, we had another excellent quarter. Our results were driven by strong end markets as well as strong execution across the entire organization. As a result, we are again increasing our full year financial outlook. With that, let's turn to our results and updated full year guidance. Unless otherwise noted, my statements will be about the second quarter and how it compares to the same period in 2022. And my commentary will be on a constant currency and adjusted operating basis.\nNet sales were $1.870 billion, an increase of 4.9% on a reported basis and an increase of 6%, excluding the impact of foreign currency. Additionally, we had a selling day headwind of less than 50 basis points in the quarter. Overall, the business continues to benefit from a recovery of elective procedures driven by continued market normalization, including hospital staffing and procedure cancellations returning to pre-COVID levels. We also benefited from some backlog recapture.\nWhile market momentum is strong, we continue to face certain macro challenges, including global supply chain pressures that muted performance across the business. U.S. growth of 5% continued to outpace our expectations and international growth of 7.2% was driven by strong performance in both EMEA as well as Asia Pacific. All regions benefited from continued recovery of elective procedures, backlog recapture as well as strong commercial execution and new product uptake.\nTurning to our business category performance. Global Knees grew 10.5% with U.S. growing 9.8% and international growing 11.4%. The strong performance in these was driven by the 4 pillars that Bryan mentioned earlier, centering on a very attractive Persona portfolio, combined with the benefits of our ROSA Robotics Platform.\nGlobal Hips grew 4.9% with U.S. Hips up 2.7% and international up 7.1%, -- both regions posted good growth on the back of new product flow, execution and market recovery. Next, the S.E.T. category was down 30 basis points year-over-year, Inside of that, we saw continued strong performance from our three focus areas within the business segment. As expected, we saw pressure from reimbursement headwinds within the Restorative Therapies business. In addition, we experienced more acute supply challenges within Sports and Trauma.\nIn the backdrop of this, we believe we will move beyond these headwinds, and this segment will rebound in the second half of the year. Finally, our Other category grew 6.5%. Now moving on to the P&L. In Q2, we reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1 compared to GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.73 in the prior year. The increase was driven by higher revenues combined with lower nonoperating expenses due to [ Zimve ] investment losses from the prior year that did not repeat as well as lower spend related to restructuring costs. These benefits were partially offset by increased investment in R&D and commercial initiatives to drive future growth. On an adjusted basis, we reported diluted earnings per share of $1.82 were flat to the prior year.\nHigher year-over-year revenues and better gross margins were offset by higher R&D expenses, increased investments into commercial infrastructure for new product launches and higher interest expense. Our adjusted gross margin was 72%, up 40 basis points from the prior year despite absorbing current year inflationary pressures as well as pressure from prior year that was capitalized and flowing into this year's P&L. Favorable mix and FX hedge gains also helped support the increase in gross margin. Adjusted operating margin for the second quarter was 27.5%, down 50 basis points from the prior year.\nWhile gross margin was up, this was offset by higher operating expenses due to increased investments in R&D, aligned to our plan to improve our vitality index through new product innovation as well as higher commercial infrastructure costs to support new product uptake.\nNet interest and other nonoperating expenses of $57 million was higher than our expectations and significantly higher than the prior year due to certain foreign currency losses in the quarter as well as higher interest rates. Our adjusted tax rate of 16.3% was in line with expectations. Turning to cash and liquidity.\nOperating cash flows were $348 million and free cash flow totaled $165 million. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $320 million. Our balance sheet remains strong, providing strategic and financial flexibility for future growth. Moving to our updated financial outlook for 2023. Based on another strong quarter of results, we are again raising our full year 2023 outlook. We are confident that we will continue to grow our top line above market rates and expand operating margin while continuing to reinvest in our business for future growth.\nWe are increasing and narrowing our constant currency revenue growth range to 7% to 7.5% with an expected foreign currency exchange headwind of 50 basis points. We are also increasing our adjusted EPS guidance range to $7.47 to $7.57. Additionally, due to certain FX-related pressures and higher interest rates, we now expect net interest and other nonoperating expenses to be around $200 million for the year. Our expectation around tax rate and total shares outstanding remains unchanged. and we continue to expect free cash flow to be in the range of $1 billion to $1.1 billion.\nOur Q3 and Q4 revenue cadence expectations are unchanged. Q3 revenue dollars are expected to be sequentially down versus Q2 and in line with normal seasonality, and Q4 will be our strongest quarter on a dollar basis. While we expect momentum gained from the first half to flow into the second half of the year, recent and new sanctions on Russia may mute growth. And regarding [ selling day impact ], we continue to expect Q3 to have a selling day headwind of about 150 basis points, while Q4 will have about 100 basis point tailwind. Overall, the net day rate impact for the full year is not meaningful.\nFrom a margin perspective, we expect Q3 to be our low watermark for the year from both a gross margin and operating margin standpoint. While gross margin will have less variability from quarter-to-quarter, we expect Q3 operating margin to step down sequentially between 150 and 200 basis points due to the normal seasonality of our business. We expect Q4 to step up significantly on a sequential basis, delivering our highest operating margin for the year. Importantly, we remain committed to investing for future growth while delivering meaningful full year margin expansion in 2023. We're really pleased with how our team is navigating a challenging environment.\nIn summary, we delivered another quarter of excellent top line results, beating our expectations while managing very real supply chain challenges. We are building on our early momentum through continued execution and are again able to increase our full year guidance. We are also reiterating our confidence and expectation to be a 4% plus or even mid-single-digit top line grower in a normalized market while delivering strong earnings. In short, our business has never been stronger. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Kerri."

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, November 2, 2022. (Operator Instructions)\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Keri Mattox, Senior Vice President, Chief Communications and Administration Officer. Please go ahead.\n\nKeri P. Mattox\n\nChief Communications & Administration Officer and Senior VP of IR, Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. I hope you are all well and safe. Welcome to Zimmer Biomet's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today are Bryan Hanson, our Chairman, President and CEO; EVP and CFO, Suky Upadhyay; and COO, Ivan Tornos.\nBefore we get started, I'd like to remind you that our comments during this call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Please note, we assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements even if actual results or future expectations change materially. Please refer to our SEC filings for a detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties in addition to the inherent limitations of such forward-looking statements.\nAdditionally, the discussions on this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included within our Q3 earnings release, which can be found on our website, zimmerbiomet.com.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Bryan. Bryan?\n\nBryan C. Hanson\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc.\n\nThanks, Keri, and thanks for joining us for the call this morning. We've got 3 sections of the call. First, I'm going to briefly talk about our Q3 performance and really the momentum that we saw in Q3 that has allowed us to increase our outlook for the year and doing so even in the face of some pretty meaningful macro pressures that we're certainly still facing. I also want to spend time talking about our ZB innovation. This is clearly the driver of our continued strong performance and will be the driver as we go forward.\nAnd for the second section, Suky will provide more detail on the quarter, but probably more importantly, our 2022 guidance update. And then we'll close things out by addressing any questions you might have.\nBefore I get started on Q3, I just want to make sure that I take a minute to say thank you. Thank you to the ZB team members that I know are listening. I know a lot of you listen to the call, and I appreciate that. Your continued strong performance is -- it's just built on day in and day out execution. You're just focused on driving results. And I know you're showing up and facing some very, very real macro challenges right now, and I appreciate it. The fact is, I'm just really proud that even in the face of these challenges, you're delivering results for our customers, you're delivering results for our patients and for our shareholders, and you're moving the mission of this company forward every single day. I know it's not easy, but I promise you, it is much appreciated.\nOkay. So turning to the third quarter. Although the beginning of the quarter was a bit choppy when it comes to procedure cancellations, we did see very nice improvement throughout the quarter, and we finished strong. And that execution and recovery occurred in all of our regions, but especially in our o U.S. regions, with both EMEA and APAC performing better than our expectations. Inside of this, we saw good momentum in our large Joints business, with our Knee Franchise growing in the high single digits and our Hip business growing just above 10%. And as you've seen, this was somewhat offset by the telegraphed and expected pressure in our S.E.T. business and our other category.\nNow although we did see the strength in the quarter, we continue to face significant challenges across foreign currency, supply, inflation and staffing. That said, the team has been able to navigate these challenges and mitigate their impact. You can't completely eliminate them, but they've certainly mitigated their impact. And they've done this through operational and commercial discipline as well as driving our innovation in the field. And as a result, our confidence continues to grow, and you see that reflected in our updated financial guidance.\nIn short, our underlying business is clearly strong, and I truly do believe it's getting stronger. Just as an example, when we look at the quarter, we announced a first-of-its-kind 3-year agreement with Hospital for Special Surgery, or HSS. The partnership creates HSS, Zimmer Biomet innovation center for artificial intelligence and robotic joint replacement. We're focused here with HSS to develop new tools that will be powered by AI to provide data-driven recommendations or insights to surgeons for robotic-assisted joint surgery.\nIt's really -- it's a big deal. It's -- we're clearly very excited about it. We really do believe, this is a future of medicine opportunity, and we're excited to be involved with HSS.\nIn our Q3, our new product pipeline continue to deliver as well. While it's early, we're definitely excited about the launch of HipInsight. This is the first FDA-cleared mixed-reality navigation system for total hip replacement. HipInsight is the latest addition to our OptiVu portfolio, and it further expands our ZBEdge suite of solutions. Additionally, we announced the FDA clearance of our Identity Shoulder System. This is a technology that has proprietary capability of aligning each surgeon's approach to an individual patient's anatomy. All of this with the goal, first and foremost, of alleviating pain, but also optimizing the range of motion for that patient.\nAnd I got to tell you, our existing product portfolio kept up the momentum as well. Demand continues for ROSA, both in knee and hip. Persona Revision traction in the U.S. remained strong, and our limited launch of Persona iQ is driving positive feedback and interest. And we're focused on aggressive data collection so that we can establish clinical use benefits. And we expect to build on this momentum with new product launches in the coming months, including, as we've talked about, our new Persona cementless form factor, additional launches in our S.E.T. category and a hip product launch that we're excited about in early 2023.\nAnd I can tell you that all of these product innovations, coupled with our ongoing efforts to reshape our business, and accelerate ZB's transformation position us very well for future growth. We continue to strive to be a best and preferred place to work for our team members, and we continue to strive to be a top quartile performer for our shareholders and to be a trusted partner to all of our stakeholders but in particular, our customers and our patients.\nJust in summary, we're navigating and really managing through some very real macro headwinds that are definitely muting our growth. But we're also seeing an offset via COVID recovery, very strong execution from the team and meaningful innovation in the field. And against that backdrop, our team continues to execute our strategy, and I feel increasingly confident about our future as a company.\nAnd with that, I'm going to turn it to Suky to talk more in depth about Q3 and give you an outlook for 2022 guidance. Okay, Suky.\n\nSuketu P. Upadhyay\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc.\n\nThanks, Bryan, and good morning. Overall, we delivered another good quarter, driven by strong execution and continued recovery of elective procedures. While we continue to navigate challenges, our third quarter performance gives us the confidence to raise our full year financial guidance. With that, I'll turn to our third quarter results. Unless otherwise noted, my statements will be about the third quarter of 2022 and how it compares to the same period in '21. And my commentary will be on a constant currency and adjusted continuing operations basis.\nNet sales in the third quarter were $1.67 billion, a decrease of 0.9% on a reported basis and an increase of 5% on a constant currency basis. U.S. sales grew 3.2%, driven by strong elective procedure recovery and commercial execution, especially in our Knee and Hip businesses. This was partially offset by expected declines in the S.E.T. and other categories.\nInternational sales grew 7.3%, driven by strong procedure volumes across most markets in EMEA and APAC, in tandem with lighter comps and continued strong commercial execution. EMEA performed better than expected, driven by recovery in developed markets and continued strength in emerging markets, and APAC performed better than expected, with China largely in line with expectations and strength in Japan.\nTurning to our business category performance. Global Knees grew 7.2%, with U.S. Knees up 7.3% and International Knees up 7%. The strong performance was driven by knee procedure recovery across most regions and easier comps, along with continued global traction of our Persona Knee System, especially with Persona Revision in the U.S., and continue to increase in ROSA procedure penetration and pull-through.\nGlobal Hips grew 10.5%, with U.S. Hips up 5.3% and International Hips up 15.5%, driven by strong international procedure recovery and an easier comp outside of the U.S. Continued traction across key Hip products, including the G7 Revision System, and Avenir Complete Primary Hip, which is focused on the direct interior surgical approach. And lastly, continued solid ROSA pull-through in the hip category, especially in the U.S.\nThe sports extremities and trauma category declined 2.1% and was impacted by a tough comp in 2021 and the expected pressure around VBP, which is expected to reverse in Q4, and reimbursement headwinds in U.S. restorative therapies that will anniversary in mid-2023. Within the category, we continued to deliver strong performance across our key focus areas of CMFT, sports medicine and upper extremities. Finally, our other category declined 0.4%, driven by tough comps and expected lower capital sales related to a higher mix of ROSA placements versus upfront sales.\nMoving to the P&L. For the quarter, we reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.92 compared to GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.77 in the third quarter of 2021. The increase was driven by a decline in litigation-related expenses and a tax benefit in the quarter from a favorable tax liability outcome. On an adjusted basis, diluted earnings per share of $1.58 represents a decrease from $1.71 in the third quarter of 2021.\nAdjusted gross margin was 70.7%, in line with expectations. As previously discussed, heightened inflationary pressure will drive full year gross margins to be slightly down when compared to the prior year. As previously noted, increasing input costs from this year will pull through into 2023, and we now expect the headwind from inflation in 2023 to be at the upper end of our previously communicated 50 to 100 basis point range.\nOur adjusted operating expenses were $742 million, an increase versus the prior year due to inflationary pressures and higher investments into R&D to support future product launches. Our adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 26.3%, a 200-basis point decline from the prior year and largely driven by increased inflationary pressures and continued investments into the pipeline and product portfolio.\nDespite ongoing macro headwinds, we continue to expect our efficiency programs to drive improved second half operating margins versus the first half of the year, with a step-up in the fourth quarter in tandem with higher revenue. The adjusted tax rate was 16.3% in the quarter, in line with our expectations.\nTurning to cash and liquidity. Operating cash flows were $451 million and free cash flow totaled $332 million for the quarter. We reduced our debt by about $160 million in the third quarter, excluding the effects of foreign currency, and ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of about $545 million. On a related note, despite a higher interest rate environment in 2022, interest expense is expected to be broadly in line with our previous expectations for the year. However, we would expect a step-up of interest expense into 2023.\nWe have made significant progress in strengthening our balance sheet through improved financial performance and ongoing debt reduction, ultimately providing greater strategic flexibility for the company.\nMoving on to our updated financial outlook for the year. Constant currency revenue growth is now expected to be 5.5% to 6.5% versus 2021, with an expected foreign currency exchange headwind based on recent spot rates of 550 basis points versus our previous assumption of 500 basis points. This means that reported revenue growth will be in the range of 0% to 1% versus 2021.\nAlso related to revenue, based on the recent spot rates, we estimate that the strengthening of the dollar through 2022 will create about a 300-basis point headwind to revenue growth in 2023. Additionally, we are tightening our expected adjusted diluted EPS range to $6.80 to $6.90. All other metrics in our '22 financial guidance remain unchanged from our second quarter update.\nAs a reminder, we expect Q4 revenue growth to be slightly higher than the third quarter due in part to a tailwind related to Q4 2021 VBP charges that will be partially offset by about a 1-day selling day headwind.\nIn summary, we had another solid quarter, underpinned by market recovery and good execution, and we are pleased to again raise our full year outlook. While we expect to have to continue to navigate a number of persistent macro headwinds, ongoing market recovery in tandem with strong execution and an attractive product pipeline leaves us confident about our future. And lastly, I'm extremely proud of and want to thank our broader ZB team for all that they do.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to Keri. Thank you.\n\nKeri P. Mattox\n\nChief Communications & Administration Officer and Senior VP of IR, Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc.\n\nThanks, Suky. Before we start the Q&A session, (Operator Instructions) With that, operator, may we have the first question, please?"

[Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, May 2, 2024. Following today's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions].\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Keri Mattox, Chief Communications and Administration Officer. Please go ahead.\n\nKeri P. Mattox\n\nVice President-Corporate & Investor Relations, AmerisourceBergen Corp.\n\nThank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Zimmer Biomet's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today are Ivan Tornos, our President and CEO; and CFO and EVP Finance, Operations and Supply Chain, Suky Upadhyay.\nBefore we get started, I'd like to remind you that our comments during this call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Please note, we assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements even if the actual results or future expectations change materially. Please refer to our SEC filings for a detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties in addition to the inherent limitations of such forward-looking statements.\nAdditionally, the discussions on this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures, some of which are forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and an explanation of our basis for calculating these measures is included within our Q1 earnings release which can be found on our website, zimmerbiomet.com. With that, I'll turn the call over to Ivan. Ivan?\n\nIvan Tornos\n\nChief Operating Officer\n\nThank you, Keri, and thank you, everyone, for joining the call here this morning. I'd like to start today the way that I typically do by taking a moment to recognize and to show my gratitude to the 18,000 Zimmer Biomet team members across the globe, who each and every day work relentlessly in driving our mission forward. Simply put them, I'm very proud of each and every one of you. Thank you for your dedication, for your commitment resilience and for your strong performance to start off this year 2024.\nIt is truly this great workforce and the culture that we have here in place at a Biomet that gives me -- gives us confidence behind the financial commitments that we're making. Given the fact that we have a very robust Investor Day coming up in just a few weeks, I will keep my opening remarks short with the goal of moving quickly into today's Q&A session. I'll touch on 3 key areas briefly.\nFirst, I'm going to provide some general comments on the results in the quarter versus our own expectations. Secondly, I'll cover the drivers of the performance, and we'll touch on why we believe that these drivers are sustainable. And then lastly, I'll close with a brief summary on our progress against our 3 strategic priorities, which have been discussing since day 1, those being people and culture, operational excellence and diversification innovation.\nStarting with the quarterly results. Overall, we are very encouraged with our Q1 performance which was ahead of our own expectations, driven by healthy end markets, combined with the strong execution across the organization globally. We ended the quarter continuing the momentum that we saw in 2023 delivering 4.4% constant currency revenue growth, while overstepping a sizable day rate headwind and facing rather difficult comps versus a year ago.\nIn fact, it is reassuring to see that on a day rate adjusted basis, our growth for the quarter was greater than 6% and with several areas of the business and geographies contributing to such solid results. In addition to the sound revenue performance, we drove adjusted margin expansion and grew adjusted earnings even while our effective tax rate increased over 200 basis points. This results to start 2024 and give us great confidence that Zimmer Biomet will deliver 5% to 6% constant currency revenue growth in the year while driving sizable adjusted operating margin expansion. So pleased to reaffirm our guidance for the year.\nThis, in turn, will enable mid- to high single-digit adjusted earnings growth while realizing our commitment of seeing free cash flow growing faster than earnings. Suky is going to provide more color around these areas later, but a strong performance in the quarter. And again, reaffirming guidance for the year. Net-net, it's encouraging to see us exiting Q1 of 2024 with a revenue growth run rate in the mid-single-digit range, which is consistent with where we exited the second half of 2023.\nWith new products -- new product introduction ramping later in the year. We like what we see in terms of sustainability in our growth trajectory which we have said all along will accelerate in the second half of 2024. Key drivers behind our Q1 results came from both a macro and micro standpoint, starting with macro factors or end markets, as we've been saying all along, remain very healthy driven by high levels of patient demand due to demographic shifts.\nThe continued shift to [indiscernible] here in the U.S. is also a tailwind and across the board in the industry, we've seen better surgical outcomes and technological advancements, which are driving more pace in demand. On top of that, you've got to improve pricing dynamics. And to that end, pleased to report that pricing in the quarter was about flat as opposed to the 200 to 300 basis points of price erosion that this space this industry has seen historically. From a macro standpoint, the main enablers of our Q1 results were the adoption of ROSA technology globally, with a correlated pull-through of Persona. We also saw some execution of growth drivers within SEP, particularly in [ solar], within sports medicine and in our CMFT Craniomaxillofacial thoracic business in conjunction with rapid adoption of personality, that is our [indiscernible] platform, which is quickly gaining share in the markets where we have launched the product.\nAs we enter the second half of 2024, these new product introductions as well as other new product entries, will become more meaningful from a revenue growth standpoint with Persona, OsseoTi entering then a full launch status seeing higher realization of HAMR or surgical Impactor, which we recently launched and also gaining traction with ROSA [ Shoulder ] which we started doing cases recently here in the U.S.\nOn top of that, we're going to be entering the market with our triple taper hip stem, that's [indiscernible] on which is going to allow us to better compete in the direct anterior hip category. So really excited about the completed portfolio in hips and the upcoming launch FDA approved now for [indiscernible] hips.\nIn addition to driving successful 2024 annual results, we are committed to the 3 strategic priorities that outlined in my first earnings call as the CEO in November 2023. This, no doubt, will enable long-term success for the organization. I continue to repeat these 3 priorities over and over in every Zimmer Biomet meeting around the world. And I can tell you that they are resonating with the audience as the absolute mass does for the long-term success of the organization.\nOnce again, these 3 imperatives are people and culture, number one, operational excellence, number 2, and innovation and diversification number 3. I would like now to quickly provide you with an update in terms of key progress across these 3 areas. Further detail will come during our May 29 Investor Day in New York City.\nFirst, in the area of people and culture, we continue to operate ZimaBaomed with best-in-class engagement metrics and low employee attrition. We have been recognized across different areas when it comes to people and culture. And recently, we've been showcased in various publications, including Newsweek, Great Places to Work and Forbes. In the area of people and culture, it's worth noting also that our restructuring program, which we announced a quarter ago, has now been implemented almost entirely with no major disruptions to report.\nWe have realized substantial benefits post this initiative, including realizing cost savings earlier than initially expected as well as achieving increased operational agility and enhance accountability.\nIn the second area of operational excellence, we've made robust progress in implementing our enhanced inventory management programs around the world, working intensely with third-party firms, we develop a plan we're executing against the plan. We remain committed to a meaningful improvement in DOH in the year 2024 and in years to come. Again, more color in that regard during our Investor Day.\nIn operational excellence, we have also established core initiatives around best-in-class product launches to ensure that these new product introductions gained traction sooner than expected and we launched these products in a better way that we have launched in the past. This is beyond critical for Zimmer Biomet as we continue to deliver a rapid cadence of product launches with plans to release more than 40 new products in the next 24 to 36 months. One final comment in operational excellence in the area of pricing, we've made structural changes to further enhance the pricing strategy that we put in place over the last several quarters.\nMoving on to the third and final strategic priority. In the area of innovation and diversification, we're making solid progress. We continue to see strong traction in key brands such as Persona OsseoTi. I mentioned already gaining share in the markets where we have launched. We've seen progress with ROSA. We continue to gain momentum with [ Signature 1 ] planning guides in the [ solar ] space, and we love what we're seeing with our embody soft tissue franchise. CMFT continues to deliver new product introductions, gaining share in the markets where we partake. And I'm very excited about the new product introductions that we have seen and we'll continue to see in our ASC portfolio in the U.S.\nWe've also made tremendous strides in new products with a more focused pipeline that today as of Q1 2024, has twice the dollar value that we had at the end of 2018. So the dollar value of the pipeline in innovation is twice what it was 4 or 5 years ago. Worth reminding everyone that north of 80% of these products in the pipeline, residing markets growing above 4%, and many of them are accretive from a gross margin standpoint. So we continue our commitment of innovating from a customer-centric standpoint, but also innovating to see incremental profitability and an increased [ WEMGAR ] profile.\nIn addition to driving results in core markets, we're also focused on diversifying our portfolio into more attractive, faster-growth end markets with the goal of increasing our [ WAMGR], weighted average market growth rate. We have made significant progress over the past several years, balance [ it ] through what it is today. And this fact in addition to the confidence around future free cash flow generation, give us the optionality and the firepower to execute on the right deals at the right time the most importantly, meet our internal hurdles from both a financial and a strategic perspective.\nSo again, lots going on inorganically potentially as well as organically with the size of the pipeline. While we have flexibility in the size of the deals to come, we continue to favor the smaller tuck-ins to midsize deals. That's up to $2 billion in acquisition price that become EPS neutral within 2 years and that from a ROIC standpoint, return on invested capital, will deliver upper single digit to low double digit within 5 years.\nAs I mentioned earlier, we're very encouraged with our Q1 performance, a quarter in where we grew 4.4% in constant currency. North of 6% in day rate while overcoming a number of winds and tough comps. It is this quarter results from the first quarter 2024 that give us a strong confidence that in the year 2024, will realize our guidance of delivering 5% to 6% in revenue, growing 100 to 200 basis points above market while delivering earnings growing faster than revenue and delivering free cash flow above the earnings growth.\nThis is the commitment that we're making for 2024, and it's a commitment that we're going to reiterate in our Investor Day for years to come. Before closing the call, I'd like to announce that Keri Mattox has made a decision to depart from Zimmer Biomet at the end of May. Keri has been a trusted partner and a very close collaborator and friend on this journey and has enabled great things for Zimmer Biomet in her 4-plus years here with ZB. She's going to be missed, and we wish her the best in her future endeavors. A search for a Head of IR position is in progress with a leading executive search firm, and we hope to announce Keri's replacement here very soon. SAG is going to continue to lead IR interactions for Zimmer Biomet. So a plan for continuity is in place.\nIn conclusion, we're very proud of how far we have come as an organization and are even more excited about where we can go. Strong confidence on the year 2024. We continue to make commitments and deliver on those commitments as evidenced by these results and as evidenced by the new product introductions commitment that we made and we're realizing. [ Allow the ] fact that were impacting the lives of millions of patients around the globe, and I'm inspired by the fact that [ my team mates aligned ] are living the Zimmer Biomet mission of alleviating pain and improving the quality of life for people around the world. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Suky. Suky?\n\nSuketu P. Upadhyay\n\nnullExecutive Vice President, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer\n\nThanks, and good morning, everyone. As Ivan mentioned, we had another good quarter driven by healthy end markets and solid execution across the organization. Overall, we remain on track to deliver on our 2024 financial guidance with mid-single-digit constant currency revenue growth, adjusted operating margin expansion and over $1 billion of free cash flow. Assuming current market conditions, this is a financial profile that we believe is durable going forward.\nMoving to Q1 results. Unless otherwise noted, my statements will be about the first quarter of 2024 and how it compares to the same period in 2023, and my commentary will be on a constant currency and adjusted operating basis. Net sales were $1.889 billion, an increase of 3.2% on a reported basis and an increase of 4.4%, excluding the impact of foreign currency. Additionally, we had a selling day headwind of about 200 basis points that impacted all regions and product categories at about the same level.\nExcluding the selling day impact, consolidated constant currency sales would have grown above 6%. U.S. growth was 3.7% and international grew 5.4%. Growth in the U.S. was driven by solid performance in [ Recon ] in our priority areas within SET as well as our other category. Outside of the U.S., EMEA saw stronger-than-expected growth on a regional basis. And from a portfolio perspective, OUS growth was primarily driven by our knee category.\nGlobal Knees grew 4.3% in the quarter with the U.S. growing 2.2% and international growing 7.3%. Growth in our knee business continues to be driven by our Persona product portfolio and ROSA robotics platform. We remain excited about the growth coming from new and recent product launches across the knee segment. Global Hips grew 1.5% in the quarter with the U.S. growing 1% and international growing 2%. We remain focused on accelerating performance in the Hip segment with key product launches that Ivan mentioned earlier.\nNext, the SET category grew 5.3%, led by our key focus areas of CMFT, upper extremities and sports growing on average about low double digits. This strong growth was partially offset by the other subsegments within the category. Despite the choppiness within SET, we remain confident this business will drive mid-single-digit or above growth for the full year.\nFinally, our other category grew 12.2%, driven by continued strong ROSA sales. We expect growth in the other category will moderate lower as we move through the rest of the year. In Q1, we reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.84 compared to GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.11 in the prior year. Higher revenue and a lower share count in Q1 2024 was offset by higher selling costs and expenses associated with our restructuring program. On an adjusted basis, we reported diluted earnings per share of $1.94 compared to $1.89 in the prior year. The step-up is primarily driven by revenue growth, accelerated savings pull-through from the restructuring program and a lower share count, partially offset by higher interest expenses and taxes related to [ Pillar 2].\nForeign currency was a headwind of about $0.04 in the quarter when compared to the prior year. Our adjusted gross margin was 72.9%, driven by higher manufacturing costs, which were offset by better pricing and lower royalties. Overall, gross margin was in line with expectations and with the prior year.\nAdjusted operating margin was 28.6%, slightly ahead of the prior year. The increase in operating margin was driven by higher sales and lower SG&A related to the restructuring program I referenced earlier. Net interest and other adjusted non-op expenses were $49 million in the quarter, slightly higher than the prior year. And our adjusted tax rate was 18.5%, and we continue to project our full year rate at 18%.\nTurning to cash and liquidity. We generated operating cash flows of $228 million, free cash flow of $91 million, and we ended the quarter with $393 million of cash and cash equivalents. Regarding our outlook for the rest of the year, we are reiterating our full year guidance, including constant currency growth of 5% to 6% or 4.5% to 5.5% reported revenue growth with a 50 basis point currency headwind. Additionally, we continue to expect earnings to be between $8 to $8.15, and that we will generate between $1.50 billion to $1.1 billion of free cash flow.\nFrom a cadence perspective, we still expect constant currency revenue growth for the first half of the year to be at the lower end of mid-single-digit growth in the second half of the year to be at the upper end of mid-single-digit growth. As a reminder, Q2 and Q3 will each have about 150 basis point tailwind due to selling days and the selling day impact for Q4 and for the full year is expected to be immaterial or less than 50 basis points.\nRegarding the P&L, we expect adjusted gross margin to be broadly in line with 2023 and slightly better than our original thinking due to less FX headwinds than originally assumed. Given the strength in dollar, FX hedge gains are not as big a step down in 2024 as originally expected. Looking at gross margin, we expect Q1 to be the high watermark, followed by a modest sequential step down throughout the year. Overall, first half gross margins will be about 100 basis points higher than the second half as we continue to feather in capitalize inflationary costs from the second half of 2023.\nTurning to adjusted operating margin. We are pleased with the start to the year as our restructuring efforts are delivering slightly ahead of schedule. Overall, second half operating margins will be higher than the first half. And we expect for the full year that at the midpoint of our guidance, we will increase operating margins by about 80 basis points.\nIn summary, Q1 was a good start to the year. We delivered results ahead of expectations and continue to feel confident in our 2024 outlook as evidenced by the reiteration of guidance. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Keri.\n\nKeri P. Mattox\n\nVice President-Corporate & Investor Relations, AmerisourceBergen Corp.\n\nThanks, Suky. And thanks, Ivan, for the kind words. It's been such a privilege to be part of the Zimmer Biomet team these 4.5 years, and I wish the team much continued success moving forward.\nNow before we start the Q&A session, just a quick reminder to please limit yourself to a single question and one brief follow-up so that we can get through as many questions as possible during the call. With that, operator, may we have the first question, please."

(Operator Instructions). As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, August 2, 2022. (Operator Instructions).\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Keri Mattox, Senior Vice President, Chief Communications and Administration Officer. Please go ahead.\n\nKeri P. Mattox\n\nChief Communications & Administration Officer and Senior VP of IR, Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. I hope you are all well and safe. Welcome to Zimmer Biomet's Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today are Bryan Hanson, our Chairman, President and CEO; and EVP and CFO, Suky Upadhyay; and COO, Ivan Tornos.\nBefore we get started, I'd like to remind you that our comments during this call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Please note, we assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements even if actual results or future expectations change materially. Please refer to our SEC filings for a detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties in addition to the inherent limitations of such forward-looking statements. Additionally, the discussions on this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included within our Q2 earnings release, which can be found on our website, zimmerbiomet.com.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Bryan. Bryan?\n\nBryan C. Hanson\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc.\n\nAll right. Great. Thanks, Keri, and thanks to all of you for joining us this morning for the call. We've got 3 sections for the call this morning. The first section, I'll talk briefly about our Q2 performance from an overall perspective and how a combination of strong execution and COVID recovery have actually enabled us to revise our expectations up again for the full year. And that's in the face of some pretty significant macro pressures, especially around FX.\nI'll also spend a few minutes talking about ZB innovation. That's a primary contributor to our performance today and certainly our performance in the future. So we want to make sure we touch upon that. And for the second section, I'll switch it to Suky, and Suky will obviously provide details on Q2, but I think even more importantly and probably more interesting is to talk about 2022 guidance and our updates there.\nAnd then for our favorite section of the call, we'll close things out by addressing any questions you might have, either on Q2 or any other topic. So let's go ahead and get started with Q2. And I'll start this section by saying that despite some very real and what I would define as universal challenges in our sector, I'm very proud of the fact that the team delivered again another solid quarter that actually was above our internal expectations. And I think this speaks to the teams -- I'm just going to define it as muscle memory associated with effectively managing through challenging times, and that's exactly what we have right now. With the supply concerns that are out there, it is a challenging time, and it's great to know that our team has that muscle memory to manage through it effectively. And they continue to show that.\nThe primary reason for the overachievement was stronger than anticipated COVID recovery for sure, which happened in the quarter, but also just really solid and focused execution from the team across our regions and all of our business segments. From a procedure volume standpoint, the momentum that we saw in Q1, particularly at the end of Q1, actually continued through April and May, but we did see a bit of a slowdown in June, and that has actually carried over through to July. The recovery pace was different, depending on where you were in the world in Q2, it was strong everywhere, but it was really strong outside the U.S., where we saw strong performance pretty much across the board in all of our areas, OUS. And inside of this, we saw solid momentum again in Knees and Hips. I'm really pleased to see another strong quarter in large joints and excited that we continue to get traction for our innovation in this area.\nThe momentum in large joints was then offset by some expected pressure in our set businesses and our other category, and Suky will provide more detail here in a minute. I think it's pretty clear for all of us, actually the foreign currency is a challenge. Supply challenges are very real. Inflationary pressures are with us right now. And those hurt us in Q2, all of these did. They're going to continue to pressure us through the back half of '22 and potentially beyond. But just given our business momentum thus far into the year, our new product innovation and the traction we're getting there with our customers and COVID recovery, at least a profile today, our overall confidence in 2022 has actually gotten better.\nAnd as a result of that, we are raising our full year guidance for revenue, operating margin and earnings per share. And I think this should be a solid indication that our strategy is working. And our team is executing, really just getting it done and our underlying business is gaining strength. And a big part of that, the big part of this momentum is our new product innovation and continuing to deliver in delighting our customers. And in Q2, we debuted another element of our ZBEdge ecosystem. This is an AI technology within our Omni Suite smart OR system. That focuses on optimizing surgical workflow and increasing procedure efficiency. And I'd say that's important right now. It's really important because of the capacity constraints that our customers have.\nSeparate from that, from a ROSA perspective, ROSA robotics momentum continued in both Knee and Hip for the quarter, and our placement pipeline remains extremely strong. And while it's still in limited launch in very early days, the feedback and interest in Persona iQ is positive, and we're focused on collecting as much early data as quickly as we possibly can with an eye toward clearly establishing clinical use benefits. So when we move into full launch in 2023, we're as prepared as possible. And all of these innovations and our broader ZBEdge Suite highlight the possibilities around data collection and integration on the patient and customer experience, and that's really our focus.\nIn addition to the strength of our existing product portfolio, our new product pipeline is just as exciting. We have additional product launches planned for the second half of 2022, especially across our Knee and set portfolios. In Knee, our soon-to-be launched Persona cementless form factor will complement our current form factor and provide additional momentum for cementless conversions, particularly as we get into 2023. And in our S.E.T. businesses, I'm very excited about our identity shoulder system launch. This is going to be a much more customizable shoulder for a more personalized feel for the patient that should optimize movement in the shoulder.\nWe're also continuing to reshape our business and accelerate ZB's transformation. We've made significant progress in streamlining and modernizing our operating model, but we've also really focused on making ZB a best and preferred place to work as well as a trusted partner, which are 2 of our strategic pillars for the company.\nIn Q2, Zimmer Biomet was certified by Great Place to Work. This is a global authority on workplace culture. The U.S. certification was based on direct survey feedback from our team members, which I think makes it even more compelling. We also established a new function for refining and driving our environmental, social and governance strategy but also the commitments and actions we're taking in this area as well. We have already seen significant improvements across almost every element of ESG. And truly, we're just getting started. We see this as an important responsibility as a company, for sure, but also something we believe is critically important to our team members, our customers and our investors. You'll be hearing more from us on the ESG front as we make further progress and as we continue to enhance our reporting in this area. So in summary, even though there are real macro headwinds that our team is managing, the recovery shift in COVID continues and the execution of our strategy is making a difference.\nWe'll need to stay close to the headwinds into the recovery, in the last couple of years have proven that things are fluid. But I do feel confident in our team's ability to navigate the path forward, and I'm excited about where ZB is going. And with that, I'm going to turn the call over to Suky for a deeper dive into Q2. And again, I look at our revised expectations for the year. Okay. Suky?\n\nSuketu P. Upadhyay\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc.\n\nThanks, and good morning, everyone. Overall, we had a good quarter, driven by strong execution and faster-than-expected recovery of elective procedures across most markets. While we continue to face heightened headwinds and challenges related to foreign currency, inflation and supply chain disruptions, our second quarter performance gives us the confidence to raise our full year revenue and EPS outlook.\nWith that, I'll turn to our second quarter results and how that translates into our updated full year financial guidance. Unless otherwise noted, my statements will be about the second quarter of 2022 and how it compares to the same period in 2021. And my commentary will be on a constant currency or adjusted continuing operations basis. Net sales in the second quarter were $1.782 billion, up 1% on a reported and 6% on a constant currency basis.\nAs Bryan mentioned, strong procedure volume recovery extended from the first quarter, especially as we moved into April and May with moderation of recovery in June. U.S. sales grew 1.3%, driven by strong recovery in execution as COVID cases subsided and elected procedures returned, especially in Knee and Hips. This was partially offset by lower S.E.T. growth and declines in the other category. International sales grew 12.2%, driven by strong procedural volume across most markets in EMEA and APAC. EMEA experienced rapid uptake in the second quarter across developed and emerging markets with a generally lighter comp versus 2021. Asia Pacific overall grew in line with expectations with China performing largely as projected and Japan growing better than anticipated.\nTurning to our business category performance. Global Knees grew 11.2% and with U.S. Knees up 4.5% and international Knees up 20.1%. These results were driven by easy comparisons [OUS], along with strong Knee procedure recovery across most regions, continued global traction for our Persona Knee system, especially with Persona Revision in the U.S. and ROSA penetration and pull-through.\nGlobal Hips grew 8.6%, with U.S. Hips up 2.6% and international Hips up 14.9%, driven by easier comparisons OUS in tandem with strong international procedure recovery. We also saw continued traction across key hip products, including our Arcos and G7 system for Revision and our Avenir Complete primary hip, which is focused on the direct anterior surgical approach. And lastly, we continue to see solid ROSA pull-through in the hip category.\nFourth, extremities and trauma category increased 0.1% and was impacted by a tough comp in 2021 and expected pressure in trauma due to VBP implementation as well as expected pressure in restorative therapies due to a reimbursement shift for our GEL-One product. Within the category, we continue to deliver strong performance across our key focus areas of CMFT, sports medicine and upper extremities. Finally, our other category declined 6.1%, driven by tough comps and expected lower capital sales related to a higher mix of ROSA placements versus upfront sales in the quarter.\nMoving to the P&L. We reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.73 compared to our GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.68 in the second quarter of 2021.\nHigher revenue and lower IP R&D charges more than offset restructuring costs and mark-to-market losses on our retained ZimVie stake. On an adjusted basis, diluted earnings per share of $1.82 represented an increase from $1.51 in the second quarter of '21. Higher sales in tandem with lower IP R&D in the quarter more than offset lower year-over-year gross margins.\nAdjusted gross margin was 71.6%, slightly ahead of expectations due primarily to better mix and lower pricing erosion. As a note, we expect heightened inflation to temper our observed second quarter favorability as we move through the rest of the year. We continue to project full year gross margin to be slightly down when compared to full year 2021 gross margin. And as we've said, increasing inflationary pressure will pull through into 2023, and we now expect about 50 to 100 basis points of headwind from inflation in 2023 versus our previous estimate of about 50 basis points.\nOur adjusted operating expenses were $777 million, lower than the prior year, primarily due to the 2021 IP R&D charges referenced earlier. Our adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 28%, up from the prior year. As previously noted, full year margins will be pressured versus the prior year due to inflation, supply chain headwinds and China VBP, with partial offset by the ongoing realization of our efficiency programs. Despite these ongoing headwinds, we expect those efficiency programs to drive improved second half operating margins versus the first half of the year. The adjusted tax rate was 16.5% in the quarter and in line with our expectations.\nOperating cash flows were $346 million and free cash flow totaled $240 million for the quarter. We paid down about $100 million of debt in the second quarter and ended with cash and cash equivalents of about $390 million. Our improving financial performance in tandem with ongoing reductions in debt, continue to strengthen our balance sheet for greater strategic flexibility.\nAnd now moving to our updated financial outlook for the full year 2022. We're raising our financial guidance based on the following key assumptions: COVID and customer staffing pressures will continue through 2022, but with a lesser impact than previously anticipated. Supply chain and inflationary pressures stabilize at current levels and foreign currency will be a 500 basis point headwind in '22 versus our previous projection of 350 basis points. Also, we assume about a 30% flow-through of FX-related revenue headwinds falls to EPS and that the FX headwinds applies to the full range of EPS guidance.\nAgainst this backdrop, I'll walk through our updated financial guidance for the year. Constant currency revenue growth is now expected to be 4% to 6% versus '21. With an expected foreign currency headwind of 500 basis points. This means that reported revenue growth is expected to be in the range of negative 1% to positive 1% versus 2021. We're raising adjusted operating margin by 25 basis points to the range of 26.75% to 27.75%. Adjusted tax rate guidance remains in the range of 16% to 16.5%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share is now expected to be higher at $6.70 to $6.90. And free cash flow is now expected to improve to $800 million to $900 million. And lastly, net interest expense and nonoperating expense will be modestly higher than the $160 million we anticipated earlier this year due to higher interest rates in foreign currency.\nWe expect to see typical seasonality in the back half of the year, which would suggest stronger revenue dollars in Q4 than in Q3. Additionally, we expect Q4 revenue growth to be higher than Q3 growth, in part due to the easier fourth quarter comp related to China VBP headwinds we observed in the fourth quarter of 2021. Operating margins are expected to follow a similar trend as revenue.\nIn summary, while there are macro challenges and headwinds, our team is navigating these challenges and executing well. We are raising our '22 financial guidance due to better-than-expected COVID recovery, the strength of our execution and our confidence in ZB's underlying business fundamentals. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Keri.\n\nKeri P. Mattox\n\nChief Communications & Administration Officer and Senior VP of IR, Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc.\n\nThanks, Suky. Before we start the Q&A session, just a quick reminder, please limit yourself to a single question and one follow-up so that we can get through as many questions as possible during the call. With that, operator, may we have the first question, please."

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Zach Weiner, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nZachary Ross Weiner\n\nEquity Associate, Jefferies LLC, Research Division\n\nThank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Zimmer Biomet's Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me on today's call are Ivan Tornos, our President and CEO; and CFO and EVP, Finance Operations and Supply Chain, Suky Upadhyay. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our comments during this call will include forward-looking statements.

Ivan?\n\nIvan Tornos\n\nChief Operating Officer\n\nThank you, Zack, and thank you, everyone, for joining today's call. Good morning. I would like to start the way that I usually do by taking a quick moment to show my sincere gratitude to the north of 18,000 Zimmer Biomet team members across the world who each and every day go above and beyond in delivering on our mission, elevating pain and improving the quality of life for people around the world. That's why you and I get to do each and every day and you're doing an real job in bringing this mission into action. Thank you for your commitment to Zimmer Biomet. Thank you for your tireless work and thank you for the very strong performance so far in this year 2024.\nWe are now past the midpoint in the year, and we're growing 5% after having delivered strong performances in 2023 and 2022 and 2021. So the trend is real. The performance is there, and I'm deeply proud of the work that you do in daily. As I said, countless times the Zimmer Biomet workforce and our culture here is truly one of our key competitive advantages. In today's call, I'm going to give some opening remarks, then Suky cover financials, and then as always, we will leave ample time to answer your questions.\nThe agenda for today, first, I'll cover some perspective on the quarter. Secondly, I'll discuss the drivers of our performance and why we are even more confident than ever in our updated full year guidance for 2024. And why already looking into 2025 and beyond, we're also very confident that we'll continue to deliver on the long-range plan commitments that we outlined at the end of May at our first ever Zimmer Biomet Investor Day. Recall those commitments were driving revenue growth at least at mid-single-digit growth rates, driving EPS at 1.5 revenue growth and driving free cash flow growth at least 100 basis points above our EPS commitments.\nThe servicing in the agenda will close with our strategic priorities, those being people and culture, operational excellence, and innovation and diversification. Starting with our Q2 results, we continue to be very encouraged by our global performance. In the second quarter of this year we grew 5.6% on a constant currency basis. And with that, we have now closed the first half of 2024, growing 5%. Worth noting that this 5% is versus very tough comps in the first half of 2023. The second quarter of 2024 now marks the tenth consecutive quarter in which Zimmer Biomet has grown mid-single digit or above.\nSo again, a training the making that is real. And we're very confident that this performance will continue, if not will accelerate as we continue to move our business forward. Against the backdrop, in the quarter, we did see some weakness early in the first half of the quarter in the U.S. It's worth noting that May and June here in the U.S. were better than April. And in July, the U.S. recon business actually delivered mid-single-digit growth. So choppiness through the first half of the quarter, and then an improvement through the second half, which has continued with very strong performance through the month of July. Our OUS international business outside the U.S. business has delivered above expectations, we saw a strong demand in the key markets across both Recon and the sale categories.\nSo overall, very diversified, solid performance coming out of these markets. And look the fact that in our second quarter, we continue to deliver excellent performance in our other category. This category is primarily focused on enabling technologies, primarily ROSA. We saw a strong demand for ROSA, growing double digit in the business, and we also saw strong demand in enabling technologies and navigation systems. As we have been saying for quite some time, we want to be more than just a leading reconstructive Knees and Hips company in key geographies where we have a really high market share. As an example, the U.S. or key countries of Europe and Asia Pacific.\nOne example of this diversification journey has been said. We've been committing to growing set at least mid-single digit and Q2 of 2024 is now the third quarter in a row where we are growing mid-single digit or above, a trend that we expect to continue towards the end of 2024 moving into 2025 and 2026. So nice growth in other, nice growth in international and nice growth in S.E.T. One area that I'll tell you, we've made significant strides is within our Hips portfolio. We did lose some market sharing Hips in the U.S. and all U.S. markets over the last 3 to 5 years. And as I said over and over, this was due to lacking 3 key product items, directed there stems, what we call triple taper stems elegant navigation and surgical impactors. As we sit here today, we have remediated those gaps. We have 510(k) approval for Z1 or [indiscernible] paper stem. We are regaining market share already with farmer or surgical Impactor. And today, we have the most comprehensive navigation in Hips hip arthroplasty. Not only do we have Rosa Hip, we also have the only 510(k) FDA clear augmented mixed reality Hips navigation platform via a partnership with our colleagues at Hips insights. And now we have also signed and announced an agreement to acquire Ortho Grid that is going to give us a leading position in navigation using artificial intelligence devices. So we have the most comprehensive suite of solutions in navigation, in direct anterior stems and in surgical in factors, not to mention having the best core implant technology with products like G7 and [indiscernible]. So the expectation is to grow again above market when it comes to Hips and regain some of the market share that we lost over the last 3 or 5 years.\nMoving from Hips, we have developed, and we are today the first and only robotic-assisted solder replacement platform in the world. The feedback on the cases we've done with rosa [indiscernible] continues to be very compelling. And as we enter late Q3 and early Q4, we expect to see an acceleration of those cases. And in 2025, we expect ROSA [indiscernible] to be a very meaningful growth driver for Zimmer Biomet.\nWe recently announced the partnership with [indiscernible] Surgical. This is going to provide our surgeon customers optionality across the robotic landscape. We have conducted extensive training with one voice on customer and the feedback on these partnership we think remains super. With this partnership, Zimmer Biomet is the only orthopedic company in the world that will offer both a handheld CT scan base system in the team meeting exclusive for Zimmer Biomet platform as well as a simplified C.T. scanless robotic system in our current form factor of ROSA for total knee arthroplasty. We're excited about the optionality, and we're also excited about the fact that we continue to innovate at a very fast pace when it comes to ROSA. And we're expecting to launch at least 3 new ROSA modalities in the next 3 to 8 quarters. From an earnings standpoint, we generated $2.01 of adjusted earnings per share in the quarter or growth of 10% this is in line with our long-range plan targets outlined at our Investor Day in May.\nInside of the strong performance through the first half of the year, the team continues to execute on the 3 strategic priorities that I keep outlining in each and every earnings call and every Zimmer Biomet meeting around the world. The 3 priorities of people and culture, foundational to everything that we do, operational excellence and innovation and diversification. As a [indiscernible] opening, people and culture continues to be a key competitive advantage for Zimmer Biomet. I'm proud to share that Zimmer Biomet was recently named one of America's best mid-sized companies to work for by Time magazine. This reflects the strength in team member satisfaction engagement, our revenue growth profile and the turnaround of the organization now behind us.\nOn the second imperative, operational excellence, we continue to expect to grow constant currency revenue at least at mid-single-digit level with adjusted earnings per share growing at least 1.5x revenue. and free cash flow growing at least 100 basis points faster than earnings. It is a commitment that we make in not just for 2024, but also for the long range plan 2025, 2026 and beyond. This is a mindset that continues to proliferate throughout the organization. We pay people on delivering towards such commitments. We have trained people to deliver on those commitments and the trend as I've repeated a few times in my opening remarks, is in the making.\nIn the past, when it comes to innovation and diversification, it's been very much portfolio-centric, moving from lower growth markets to higher growth markets. polling case, the super performance in set. But today, we're also thinking diversification from a geographic mix standpoint, when I continue to invest in key markets outside of the U.S. where we see an opportunity to deliver sustainable revenue and profit growth. We're encouraged by the sound performance that we've seen in our OUS business, and we expect to continue to accelerate growth in these markets with our compromising our margin performance.\nIn conclusion, we are very proud of how far we have come as an organization in terms of the financial progress, the innovation progress and the commercial execution. Our second quarter results are another proof point that we make commitments and deliver on those commitments, and we fully expect that the trend is going to continue for the balance of the year and beyond. We're confident in our guidance for the year, and we love the fact that we're impacting the lives of millions of people, and I'm deeply inspired every day in knowing that my teammates and I are leaving the Zimmer Biomet mission of alleviating pain and improving the quality of life for people around the world.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Suky. Thank you.\n\nSuketu P. Upadhyay\n\nnullExecutive Vice President, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. As Ivan mentioned, Q2 closed a solid first half of the year for Zimmer Biomet, with XFX revenue growth of 5% in the first half and operating margins well ahead of the prior year. Our results for the quarter provide increased confidence in our 2024 full year guidance, which includes 5% to 6% constant currency revenue growth and $8 to $8.15 in adjusted earnings per share. I'll provide more color on guidance shortly. Moving to the second quarter results. Unless otherwise noted, my statements will be about the second quarter of 2024 and how it compares to the same period in 2023, and my commentary will be on a constant currency and adjusted operating basis.\nNet sales were [ $1.942 billion ] an increase of 3.9% on a reported basis and an increase of 5.6%, excluding the impact of foreign currency. As a reminder, we had a day rate tailwind that impacted all businesses and regions at about the same level. Pricing at a consolidated level was 80 basis points driven by gains in international that were partially offset by modest declines in the U.S.\nOur U.S. business grew 3.5% and international grew 8.5%. The growth in the U.S. was driven by our S.E.T. and other categories. As a reminder, our other category includes our surgical business as well as enabling technologies such as ROSA capital sales. Our international business continues to perform well, driven by knee and S.E.T. with continued strength in emerging markets. Global Knees grew 5.5% in the quarter, with U.S. growing 0.8% and international growing 11.5%. U.S. growth was impacted by softer sales in the first part of the quarter with improvement in utilization and growth as we move through the second half. We continue to see strong uptake of Persona OsseoTi and remain optimistic that the recent robust ROSA installs will continue to drive pull-through and share of wallet opportunities.\nInternational continues to benefit from ROSA robotics as well as our Persona family of implants. Global Hips grew 2.8% in the quarter with the U.S. growing 1.8% and international growing 3.7%. While our Hip business has lagged the broader market due to key portfolio gaps, we have made significant progress with new product introductions and are excited to get back on the offensive in early 2025 when these products and technologies are fully in market. Next, the S.E.T. category grew 7.3%, led by our key focus areas of CMFT, upper extremities and sports growing on average, high single digits. All other categories grew mid-single digits on average, giving us confidence in our ability to drive mid-single-digit growth or better from S.E.T. through the second half of the year.\nFinally, our other category grew 11.3% in the quarter and continues to be driven by strong demand for ROSA systems and other enabling technologies. Turning to our P&L. We reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.18 compared to GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1 in the prior year. Higher revenue combined with lower R&D, effective tax rate and share count, more than offset expenses associated with our restructuring program. On an adjusted basis, we delivered diluted earnings per share of $2.01 compared to $1.82 in the prior year, representing over 10% growth. The step-up was primarily driven by revenue growth, improved operating margins due to savings pull-through from our restructuring program and a lower share count, partially offset by a higher tax rate.\nAdjusted gross margin was 71.6%, about 40 basis points lower than the prior year, driven by higher manufacturing costs, partially offset by better pricing and lower royalties. Adjusted operating margin was 28.5%, up 100 basis points from the prior year. The increase in operating margin was driven by higher revenue and lower OpEx as a percentage of sales as a result of our restructuring program. Net interest and other adjusted nonoperating expenses were $45 million in the quarter, and our adjusted tax rate was 18.2%. Turning to cash and liquidity. We generated operating cash flows of $369 million, free cash flow of $251 million, and we ended the quarter with $420 million of cash and cash equivalents.\nAligned with our capital allocation strategies, we repurchased $95 million of shares in the second quarter. Regarding our outlook for the rest of the year. We are reiterating our full year constant currency revenue growth guidance of 5% to 6%. But given further strengthening of the U.S. dollar, we are updating our reported revenue growth to 4% to 5% and now expect 100 basis points of currency headwind for the full year, which should impact Q3 more than Q4. We still expect to generate between $8 and $8.15 in adjusted earnings per share despite this greater FX pressure and $1.05 billion to $1.1 billion in free cash flow.\nOur tax and interest and nonoperating expenses expectations remain unchanged. When thinking about the cadence through the second half of the year due to normal seasonality, Q3 typically is the lowest revenue quarter from a dollar perspective. with Q4 being the highest. From a margin standpoint, we still expect gross margin to step down sequentially as the year progresses, while operating margins should expand by more than 50 basis points year-over-year. As usual, we expect operating margin to be higher in Q4 than Q3, driven by higher revenue.\nIn summary, Q2 closed a positive first half of the year, giving us continued confidence in our ability to meet our full year outlook and another positive proof point through our LRP.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to Zach.\n\nRichard Samuel Newitter\n\nResearch Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division\n\nThanks, Suky. Before we start the Q&A session, just a quick reminder to please limit yourself to a single question and 1 brief follow-up so we can get through as many questions as possible during the call. With that, operator, may we have the first question, please? ."

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, February 3, 2023. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the conference over to Keri Mattox, Senior Vice President, Chief Communications and Administration Officer. Please go ahead.\n\nKeri P. Mattox\n\nChief Communications & Administration Officer and Senior VP of IR, Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. I hope you are all well and safe. Welcome to Zimmer Biomet's Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today are Bryan Hanson, our Chairman, President and CEO; EVP and CFO, Suky Upadhyay; and COO, Ivan Tornos.\nBefore we get started, I'd like to remind you that our comments during this call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Please note, we assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements even if actual results or future expectations change materially. Please refer to our SEC filings for a detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties in addition to the inherent limitations of such forward-looking statements.\nAdditionally, the discussions on this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included within our Q4 earnings release, which can be found on our website, zimmerbiomet.com.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Bryan. Bryan?\n\nBryan C. Hanson\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc.\n\nAll right. Great. Thanks, Kerri, and thanks to all of you for joining us this morning for the call. We've really got 3 sections for the call this morning. First, I'm going to talk briefly about our fourth quarter performance and spend a few minutes on our teams, what I would just define as solid execution as well as our innovation and drivers for continued strong performance.\nAnd then for the second section, as usual, Suky will provide more detail on the quarter itself and very importantly, our 2023 guidance and expectations. And then, of course, we'll close things out by addressing any questions that you might have.\nBefore we get started, I want to take a minute to thank really the ZB team, just the full ZB team, not only for their work in making Q4 another successful quarter, but also for their resilience, the innovative thinking and dedication to getting the job done throughout all of 2022, even in the face of very real adversity.\nThere's no doubt in my mind that this team is the engine that is driving us forward. So again, thank you, and I can tell you that I'm very proud to be on this journey with you. And now as we turn to Q4 results, I know that each and every one of you made the quarter happen. And I can tell you, it was a solid quarter.\nWe again saw better-than-expected growth driven by continued procedure recovery, strong execution and a solid momentum with our new innovation. And as expected, we also benefited from some favorable comps in the quarter. Inside of this, we saw another quarter of positive year-over-year momentum in large joints, with our overall global hip and knee business growing more than 8% and 10% on an ex FX basis.\nAnd our overall S.E.T category grew in the high single digits, driven by strong performance in our business growth drivers, which as we've said before, are sports, CMFT and upper extremities as well as the expected tailwind from BVP comps in our Trauma business.\nWith that said, we are clearly seeing overall market stabilization, but our fourth quarter execution and procedure recovery is still set against a macro backdrop that is challenging and fluid. Foreign currency has improved, but remains a challenge and supply, inflation and staffing pressures continue.\nIn fourth quarter, our team was once again able to navigate these challenges, flexing what I would just define as a muscle memory that I think fortunately or unfortunately, is a bit unique to ZB and has served us well over the past year, during 2022.\nBut make no mistake, the challenges are real and they're ongoing. But regardless of this environment, with COVID mainly in the rearview mirror, I have confidence that the ZB team will continue to deliver. Our culture, our strategy, innovation and execution are coalescing right now, driving tangible momentum and importantly, belief from the team.\nAnd as a result, confidence in our business continues to grow. Let me just give a few examples from Q4. In the quarter, we announced the approval of our new cementless knee form factor, which is adding to our Persona family and strategically rounding out that portfolio.\nThe first procedures have been completed with this new keel design and the feedback, as expected, has been very positive. We continue to believe that our cementless knee penetration will grow significantly, and at this differentiated premium product can really accelerate that growth. It's early days, with full launch planned for the middle of the year, but make no mistake, this is a real growth driver for our knee franchise.\nThis launch builds on other recent product launches like HipInsights and our Identity Shoulder System introductions, bringing now our total to more than 50 new product launches from 2018 through 2022. And importantly, the largest majority of these launches came in markets we see growing in the mid-single digits or better.\nThat's really important, being launched in markets that we see growing in the mid-single digits or better. This strategic prioritization and output from our innovation pipeline has helped ZB more than double our vitality index over that time, and very importantly, increase our revenue in faster-growth markets and submarkets which, of course, drives positive increases in our weighted average market growth.\nAnd that momentum continues. We expect to launch another 40-plus products between now and the end of 2025, once again with the majority of those launches in 4% plus growth markets. This will drive further increases in our vitality index and weighted average market growth and most importantly, bring real and meaningful innovation to the patients and customers that we serve.\nSo what I know for sure is that our current momentum, a very robust new product pipeline and our strengthening balance sheet, focused on accelerating our portfolio transformation positions ZB well for the future. And as a result, I feel increasingly confident about ZB's ability to transform our business, drive growth, deliver value and achieve our mission to alleviate pain and improve the quality of life for people around the world.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Suky for a closer look at Q4, and again, our expectations for 2023. Okay, Suky?\n\nSuketu P. Upadhyay\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc.\n\nThanks, and good morning, everyone. For today's call, I'm going to focus on 3 topics. First, our fourth quarter results; second, how that performance in recent macro trends translates into our 2023 financial guidance; and third, I'll provide a brief update on our long-term financial priorities.\nWith that, I'll turn to the fourth quarter results. Unless otherwise noted, my statements will be about the fourth quarter of 2022 and how it compares to the same period in 2021, and my commentary will be on a constant currency and adjusted continuing operations basis.\nNet sales in the fourth quarter were $1.825 billion, an increase of 2.7% on a reported basis and an increase of 8.3% on a constant currency basis. Previously noted, we had a selling day headwind of 150 to 200 basis points that impacted each category at about the same level.\nU.S. sales grew 6.2%, driven by strong elective procedure recovery and commercial execution, especially in our knee and hip businesses. In addition, the U.S. business saw strength across our 3 priority areas within S.E.T.\nInternational sales grew 11.1%, driven by strong procedure volumes across most markets in EMEA and APAC in tandem with later comps and continued strong commercial execution. EMEA performance was driven by recovery in developed markets and continued strength in emerging markets.\nAPAC was impacted by COVID-19 surges and lockdowns in China that were broadly offset by strength in other markets. Now turning to our business category performance. Global Knees grew 10.2% with U.S. Knees up 10.8% and International Knees up 9.3%, with strong performance driven by knee procedure recovery across most regions and an easier comp outside of the U.S.\nContinued global traction for our Persona Knee system, including both Persona Primary and Revision in the U.S. and continued increase in ROSA procedure penetration and pull-through.\nGlobal Hips grew 8.4% with U.S. Hips up 5.9% and International Hips up 10.8%, driven by strong international procedure recovery and easier comps outside the U.S. continued traction across Hip products , including the G7 revision system and Avenir Complete primary hip, which is focused on the direct anterior surgical approach.\nAnd lastly, continued solid ROSA pull-through in the Hip category, especially in the U.S. The Sports Extremity and Trauma category grew 7.6% and was impacted by continued strong performance across our key focus areas of CMFT, Sports Medicine and Upper Extremities.\nS.E.T. was also impacted by a comp tailwind from China VBP that was partially offset by reimbursement changes in restorative therapies.\nFinally, our Other category grew 1.3%.\nMoving to the P&L. For the quarter, we reported GAAP diluted loss per share of $0.62 compared to GAAP diluted loss per share of $0.40 in the fourth quarter of 2021. The change was driven by higher revenues, partially offset by a goodwill impairment in EMEA as a result of macro factors.\nOn an adjusted basis, diluted earnings per share of $1.88 represented an increase from $1.79 in the fourth quarter of '21. Adjusted gross margin was 71.7%, bringing full year gross margin of 71.2% or about in line with full year 2021 despite significant headwinds from inflationary pressure.\nOur adjusted operating expenses were $791 million, an increase versus the prior year due to inflationary pressures in tandem with higher investments into R&D and commercial infrastructure to support new products.\nFor the year, overall OpEx was flat to 2021 with an increase in R&D and lower SG&A. We remain disciplined in realizing efficiencies while investing in our priority areas and offsetting headwinds. Adjusted operating profit margin for the quarter was 28.3%, up slightly from the prior year, bringing total year operating margin to 27.3%, ahead of full year 2021 despite macro headwinds.\nThe adjusted tax rate was 16.9% in the quarter, slightly higher than our expectations due to certain onetime discrete tax items. For the full year, the adjusted tax rate was 16.5% and in line with our full year guidance.\nTurning to cash and liquidity. Operating cash flows were $244 million and free cash flow totaled $115 million for the quarter, bringing our total free cash flow for the full year to $910 million.\nWe continue to reduce our net debt by approximately $150 million in the fourth quarter, excluding the effects of foreign currency and ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of approximately $375 million.\nMoving to our financial outlook for 2023. We based our projections on the following key assumptions: we expect to experience procedure cancellations and staffing challenges, but the impact will be less acute than what we experienced in 2022.\nSupply chain headwinds will continue throughout the year, but with improvement in the second half of '23. Pricing headwinds are expected to be slightly better than our historic average of 200 to 300 basis points.\nInflationary pressure will remain stable to 2022 exit and an expected adjusted EPS dilution of about $0.05 to $0.10 due to our acquisition of Embody in the first quarter of 2023. Against this backdrop, our expectations for the full year '23 financial outlook are reported revenue growth in the range of 1.5% to 3.5% versus 2022, and expected foreign currency exchange headwind of approximately 150 basis points, resulting in revenue growth of 3% to 5% on a constant currency basis, and adjusted diluted earnings per share in the range of $6.95 to $7.15.\nInside of that guidance, at our midpoint, we expect adjusted operating profit margins to be flat to slightly up compared to 2022 levels. We also expect net interest and other nonoperating expenses will be about $190 million, primarily due to higher interest rates.\nOur adjusted tax rate should be broadly in line with 2022 and total shares outstanding are expected to remain in line with full year 2022 average fully diluted shares outstanding.\nFinally, we expect our free cash flow to be in the range of $925 million to $1.025 billion. In terms of cadence through the year, we expect that constant currency revenue growth rate for the first half will be slightly higher than the growth rate in the second half, and we do expect choppiness by quarter.\nQ1 is projected to be our highest growth quarter due to easier comps and will be followed by the fourth quarter, driven by improved supply and innovation building throughout the year.\nQ2 and Q3 will be lighter quarters given tougher comps. And lastly, we don't expect any material day rate impact on full year results. However, Q1 and Q4 will benefit by about 100 basis points of tailwind that will be offset by headwinds in Q2 and Q3.\nIn summary, we delivered accelerated growth in 2022 with a margin profile that is better than '21, as we overcame headwinds while investing in our priority areas. We navigated a number of macro challenges and delivered on our commitments to all of our stakeholders. As we look forward to 2023, while the environment remains dynamic, we see a path to delivering solid growth and earnings performance with robust free cash flow.\nTo close out, let me make a few comments about our financial priorities moving forward. We've made significant progress over the past few years in strengthening our balance sheet through improved financial performance and ongoing reductions in debt.\nThis ultimately provides ZB with greater strategic flexibility as we look to transform our portfolio with a focus on increasing our WAMGR and driving improved long-term growth. We remain committed to our investment-grade rating, and we'll continue to look at ways to accelerate profitable growth with a focus on achieving our mission.\nI'm so very proud of the ZB team for their perseverance and dedication throughout 2022, and I'm excited about what we can accomplish in 2023. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Keri.\n\nKeri P. Mattox\n\nChief Communications & Administration Officer and Senior VP of IR, Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc.\n\nThanks, Suky. (Operator Instructions) With that, operator, may we have the first question, please?"

Following today's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session.

Mattox\n\nVice President-Corporate & Investor Relations, AmerisourceBergen Corp.\n\nThank you operator and good morning everyone. Welcome to Zimmer Biomet Fourth Quarter 2023 Earning's Conference Call. Joining me today are Ivan Tornos, our president and CEO and CFO and EVP Finance, Operations and supply chain, Suky Upadhyay. Before we get started I would like to remind you that our comments during this call will include forward-looking statements. Acutal results may differ\nmaterially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Please note, we assume no obligation to update these looking statements even if the actual results or future expectations change materially.

Reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and an explanation of our basis for calculating these measures is included within our Q4 earnings release, which can be found on our website, zimmerbiomet.com. With that, I'll turn the call over to Ivan. Ivan?\n\nIvan Tornos\n\nChief Operating Officer\n\nThank you, Kerri, and thanks, everyone, for joining the call here this morning. I'd like to start the way that I typically do, taking a moment to recognize to show my gratitude to the almost 20,000 Zimmer Biomet team members for their dedication, for their commitment, for their strong resilience and for their super performance in 2023. Simply put, 2023 was just a great year for our company. And I want to say thank you.\nIn 2023, we impacted the lives of almost 4 million patients. And along the way, we deliver best-in-class financial performance, growing our constant currency revenue by 7.5%, while adjusted EPS earnings per share grew almost 9.5% in the year. as 200 basis points of leverage between the 7.5% revenue growth and the 9.5% growth in EPS. In the year, we generated almost $1 billion in free cash flow. And that's with some turbulence around inventory management and whatnot.\nSo again, strong performance, top to bottom, and I'm just very, very proud of the execution in the year. It's worth noting that this level of execution and performance came in a year in which we still have to deal with fairly complex macro issues, whether it's inflation, FX, geopolitical challenges. I don't think I need to talk much about that and also some macro challenges in the year. We did struggle with some supply challenges throughout some of the periods. I'm happy that's behind, but it was a headwind in many periods in 2023.\nBut again, delivering 7.5% in 2023 against some tough comparables, having grown constant currency revenue in 2022, the year before, by 6.6%. So clearly, a great trend in the making, clearly strong performance, and I'm just so grateful and so proud of all of you, the Zimmer Biomet team. At the same time, beyond grateful I'm truly excited as I note that this is just the very beginning when it comes to the level of performance that we can realize here at be Zimmer Biomet. and multiple drivers of why I'm confident that this is just the very beginning.\nBut I'll start with highlighting the bold pipeline that we have in place. The size of our pipeline is twice what it used to be in 2018. We got great new product launches that are happening here early in 2024. We have a stable supply. We've created a stable supply environment. And we've got great commercial execution. We're developing flawless commercial execution as evidenced by these growth rates that I just highlighted. To compound or believe behind this level of excitement ahead is the fact that we have seen and we continue to see a substantial improvement in our end markets. This is not the same market growth profile that we used to have. Patient demand is strong. Procedure volume is very strong given a variety of reasons.\nAnd as the market leader in both knees and hips, being in better markets is just very exciting as we enter 2024. Back 5 years ago, when I joined the company, wish to think go for WAMGR weighted average market growth rates as being somewhere in the 3% range. And today, we pick our WAMGR has been very near if not at 4%. And again, that's a meaningful increase we believe, is sustainable. So we're not going back to the 3% days when it comes to market growth rates. So again, internal and external dynamics gives me gives us confidence that the best is truly ahead.\nWhen you add to all of these variables, the fact that we have the strongest balance sheet in the history of the company, that is no doubt then that we can claim that our future is nothing short of truly right. So again, very pleased, very proud and very confident. I'd like to thank our investors as well for the support in 2023 and for their confidence in 2024 and beyond. We continue to take biggest strides forward. So we're being a company with a very different growth profile from top to bottom, committing to an expectation to grow at least 100 to 200 basis points above market in revenue with our EPS, with our earnings per share growing faster than revenue and our free cash flow dollars growing faster than EPS. The guidance that we are providing today for 2024 already reflect such a commitment to this type of financial discipline.\nAnd I'm very much looking forward to our Analyst Day on May 29 in when we will provide additional details in terms of our long-range plan, which will illustrate that this is not a 1-year wonder. This is a multiyear commitment. And you will see then that Zimmer Biomet has truly entered our growth stage here, and we're no longer in turnaround mode. We're ready to deliver by being laser focus on the 3 strategic imperatives that I highlighted during my very first earnings call as [indiscernible] the strategic imperatives that I continue to repeat over and over at every Zimmer Biomet meeting. And frankly, I will continue to repeat because those are the 3 drivers that we know are going to drive our performance. Those being: number one, people and culture; number two, operational excellence; and number three, innovation and diversification.\nSo let's talk about our 2024 commitments. -- how different initiatives across these 3 strategic imperatives will drive our growth forward. First, in the area of people and culture, -- and again, I've explained this in the past, what it means, it's about having the right people in the right roles within the right culture. We must make sure that we support team members to act as owners and operators of the business. This means decentralizing decision-making, driving agility and empowering team members at every level across every function around the world. We must become leaner, and we got to be closer to the customer.\nEqually important, we must truly live an environment of pay for performance. And this is something that has already kicked off in a very meaningful way in the fiscal year -- in this fiscal 2024. An example of that is the fact that we're incentivizing free cash flow dollar generation or growth in a much more disciplined way across the enterprise knowing that revenue is also the most durable driver of free cash flow performance. incentives are also set for revenue growth to meaningfully drive compensation across our firm at every level.\nSo again, we changed the way we pay people, in terms of growing revenue above market. And we changed the way that we pay people, giving a larger percentage of compensation in adherence to the fact that we, as a company, need to grow free cash flow dollars at double-digit rates in the second area of operational excellence. And again, this is about how we think about growing the business top to bottom. You can see already in today's update in the press release that we mean it. It is tough to restructure a company. It's certainly something that we don't take lightly, and you read the press release, we had to do it. It's a tough choice once again that we needed to make operational changes to simplify our structure to deliver greater efficiency and to ensure that we're enhancing investments in the right areas of the business, again, closer to the customer.\nSo again, not an easy thing to do, but something that we had to do and something that we have done. Beyond the restructuring, other initiatives in the area of operational excellence that are already in full motion, are the new programs that we got in place kicking out how to drastically reduce inventory levels at Zimmer Biomet. This will drive substantial improvement in our free cash flow dollar growth while also reducing our days on hand DOH by 50 days or more and will reduce our excess and obsolescence exposure, which is something that, frankly, we've not done that well in previous years.\nSecond thing we're doing is the rollout of a global initiative to drive new product launch excellence across the key new product introductions that we have in the year 2024. In simple terms, the 7 or 8 most meaningful product launches, let's make sure we have a cadence of operating mechanisms with proper governance to ensure that we're maximizing these product launches across each key geography. And then the first thing we're doing in operational excellence beyond the restructuring is the integration of the pricing organization under the financial structure, reporting directly to Suketu, our CFO, to ensure maximum governance and accountability across the enterprise.\nWhile we are pleased with the reduction in price erosion over the last 2 to 3 years, we believe there is a much greater opportunity to drive even better and more durable pricing dynamics. So again, in the area of operational excellence beyond the restructuring is about drastically reducing inventory levels to generate improved free cash, flow dollar growth. It's about governance beyond or behind the new product launches. And then thirdly, is around doing better in the area of pricing dynamics.\nIn the third strategic imperative of innovation and diversification, we're going to continue to invest in innovative R&D in customer-centric R&D. We're going to continue to fuel our pipeline with meaningful product launches. We're going to continue to drive our vitality index, which has already expanded very meaningfully over the last 3 years. We're going to make sure that as we continue to launch new products, we also see margin expansion coming from these new products. I'm excited about where we are today. Our pipeline -- the dollar value associated with our pipeline is twice what it was at the end of 2019.\nAnd as we enter 2024, we have very meaningful product launches, particularly in the hip area in where we lost market share in the last 2 years, given the lack of products in key categories like surgical impactors, triple taper stems or hip navigation. So again, 2024 is the year in where through very meaningful product launches, we will regain the momentum that we lost. Beyond Hips, I'm excited about where we are in shoulder, Identity continues to generate great excitement. We will enter 2024 in full launch mode when it comes to identity. We're excited about stemless shoulders entering the market, and yes, very excited about being first to market in the category of shoulder robotics with a very highly differentiated offering in robotics for shoulders that will apply for both anatomic and reverse surgeries.\nIn the area of knees within the early days of our cementless knee launch, In 2024, we seek to increase our penetration rates drastically. Here in the U.S., our penetration rate in cementless is not even in the 20% range and we are committing to drive the penetration rate into the 50% to 60% range at a very rapid pace. Again, more details to those plans at our Analyst Day, but rest assured that our knee penetration rate in the cementless category is not going to stay in the teens or even the low 20s for long.\nBeyond cementless, we're excited about next-generation robotics in knee. We are excited about partial cementless knees. We're excited about the fact that in 2024, we're going to be entering the full launch for Persona iQ, the only smart knee in the world that fully integrates data technology and best-in-class implants in a way that nobody else is doing. In the category of [indiscernible], which is 6 different businesses, sports, foot and ankle, restorative therapies, trauma extremities and CMFT, cranio-maxillofacial thoracic, we are seeing great growth already exited in 2023. The second semester of 2023, we grew set by mid-single digit or above and as we entered 2024 and beyond, the expectation is that said, we will continue to grow mid-single digit or above. And this is something that, as a company, we've not realized ever since the merger in [indiscernible] with exclusion of the POSCO year given comps.\nSo really excited about the return on the multiple investments we made in [indiscernible], particularly in the areas of innovation and commercial execution. There is a great cadence of product launches in SEP. I already mentioned some of those and more to come when we do our Analyst Day in -- later in the spring. So excited about [indiscernible], innovation as a whole. Our new product development pipeline is strong. We're going to be launching over 40 different new products in the next 24 months or so. Most of them are going to enable category leadership, establishing Zimmer Biomet as the leader or the second position in the category.\nAnd virtually, virtually all of them are going to be in market spaces that are growing 4% plus or above. So I like the quantity, a like the quality, and like the market growth profile in terms of whether innovation is going. I'm also particularly excited about the innovation plans that we have for the here in the ASC here in the U.S., ASC side of care. We've made meaningful investments in innovation during all stages of the episode of care. What happens before surgery, what happens during surgery and what happens after surgery.\nAnd relative to the ASC in the intra-op stage of the ASC, we are best-in-class when it comes to solving problems and delivering efficiency, best-in-class outcomes and safety. So again, really excited about our ASC strategy where we're going relative to this side of care. Diversification of Zimmer Biomet's end markets will happen not just by innovation internally, but will happen through smart M&A, which will remain the #1 category when it comes to capital allocation. With the best-in-class level ratio, and with deep confidence in our free cash flow generating plans over the next few years, our strategy is to make a smart M&A, the top recipient of our capital.\nBut at the same time, I just love the fact that we have the optionality to continue to do share buybacks as we announced this morning and perhaps at a more meaningful level. So the combination of smart M&A and buybacks can coexist, given the strong free cash flow dollar generation that we are seeing come in [indiscernible] this regard. I'm energized by the very detailed and focused plans that the team has put in place, which I know that upon their execution will position Zimmer Biomet to deliver on the growth profile that we keep recommitting and that is to grow above 100 to 200 basis points.\nSo as a minimum point of entry commitment of 5% in the year 2024, with earnings per share always growing faster than revenue, and free cash flow always growing faster than EPS. This is not a 1-year commitment. This is a multiyear commitment. And again, I know based on the very detailed plans we will get there. In closing, we are very excited about where we're at the track record over the last 2 years. And most importantly, we're deeply excited in terms of where we're going to go in 2024 and beyond. The team is ready, we are establishing the right trend, and we're going to continue to drive flawless execution, delivering our commitments.\nAlong the way, we're going to help patients, we're going to create shareholder value, and we will leave our mission of [indiscernible] pain and improving the quality of life for people around the world. With that, I'll turn the call over to Suketu.\n\nSuketu P. Upadhyay\n\nnullExecutive Vice President, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer\n\nThanks, and good morning, everyone. As Ivan mentioned, our fourth quarter results ended a successful year for Zimmer Biomet with full year constant currency revenue growing 7.5% and adjusted earnings growing more than 9.5% on a reported basis, while generating just under $1 billion in free cash flow. Inside of that, our business segments performed well for the year. With Global knees constant currency growth of over 10%, Hips growth of 5% and SET growth of almost 4% and all while also expanding adjusted operating margin by almost 100 basis points, the second consecutive year of operating margin expansion in a challenging environment.\nAlso, as previously guided, we closed the second half of 2023 with mid-single-digit revenue growth and levered earnings growth, a profile we expect to continue moving forward. Let's dive into the fourth quarter results. Unless otherwise noted, my statements will be about the fourth quarter of 2023 and how it compares to the same period in 2022, and my commentary will be on a constant currency and adjusted operating basis. Net sales in the fourth quarter were $1.94 billion, an increase of 6.3% on a reported basis and an increase of 6.1% on a constant currency basis.\nWe had a selling day tailwind of about 100 basis points in the quarter. U.S. growth was 4.4% and international growth was 8.7%. As expected, we saw a robust sequential step-up versus the third quarter across all regions. Global Knees grew 5.6% in the quarter with the U.S. growing 5.4% and international growing 5.8%. The knee business continues to be driven by our Persona product portfolio, combined with our ROSA robotics platform, and we remain excited about the positive feedback around our recently launched cementless form factor for Persona, OsseoTi. For the full year, Global Knees grew 10.2%. Global hips grew 3.6% in the quarter, with the U.S. growing 4% and international growing 3.2%.\nWe are eager to accelerate performance of this segment with the addition of multiple new product offerings in 2024. For the full year, Global hips grew 5.1%. Next, the SET category grew 6.4% in the quarter, with our key focus areas of sports, CMFT and upper extremities, all growing in the mid-single digit to low double-digit range. The strong growth in these focus areas was partially offset by other subsegments within the category.\nFor the full year, SCT grew 3.8%, including a step-up to mid-single-digit growth in the second half of the year. Finally, our other category grew 15.9% in the quarter, driven by another strong quarter of Global ROSA sales. Now moving to the P&L. In Q4, we reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.01, compared to GAAP diluted loss per share of $0.62 in the prior year. The increase in GAAP results was driven by higher revenue, a goodwill impairment charge in 2022 that did not repeat favorable onetime tax benefits in 2023 and a lower share count.\nThe details around our financial performance can be found in today's press release. On an adjusted basis, we reported diluted earnings per share of $2.20 compared to $1.88 in the prior year, representing year-over-year reported growth of 17%. The step-up is driven by revenue growth, better gross margins, lower OpEx margin in tandem with a lower tax rate. Our adjusted gross margin was 72.5%, up 80 basis points from the prior year, driven by favorable mix higher volumes and lower royalties. And for the full year, we came in slightly above expectations, representing 90 basis points of year-over-year expansion. Adjusted operating margin was 30.3%, up 200 basis points from the prior year. The year-over-year operating margin step-up was primarily driven by revenue leverage, better gross margin and realized efficiencies across SG&A.\nFor the full year, operating margin was slightly ahead of expectations at 28.2%, up 90 basis points year-over-year. Net interest and other adjusted nonoperating expenses were $43 million in the quarter and $194 million for the full year. And our adjusted tax rate was 15.8%, the slightly more favorable tax rate was driven by discrete onetime items in the quarter, bringing our full year tax rate to 16.3% and in line with overall expectations.\nTurning to cash and liquidity. We generated operating cash flows of $588 million and free cash flow totaled $447 million, and we ended the year with cash and cash equivalents totaling $416 million. As Ivan mentioned earlier, we completed a $500 million share buyback program in early 2024, which is more than required to offset annual dilution. For the full year, we generated operating cash flow of just under $1.6 billion and free cash flow of $979 million. Our balance sheet remains strong, leaving us continued financial flexibility and strategic optionality as we move forward.\nNow moving on to our financial outlook for 2024, our outlook takes into account certain key assumptions, including pricing, which is expected to be about 100 to 150 basis points of erosion, but it's a continued step change improvement from historical trends. We expect to see continued strength in our end markets in tandem with new product introductions and continued improvement in product supply. Against that backdrop, we expect 2024 constant currency revenue growth of 5% to 6%, including a foreign currency exchange headwind of approximately 50 basis points, translating to reported growth of 4.5% to 5.5%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share in the range of $8 to $8.15, representing reported growth of 6% to 8%.\nAnd currency is expected to have about an $0.08 headwind on EPS based on recent rates and the implementation of Pillar 2 has an $0.18 or about a 250 basis point headwind on earnings per share growth for the year. This implies operating margin expansion of greater than 50 basis points at the EPS guidance midpoint when compared to 2023. We expect slightly lower year-over-year gross margins to be more than offset by efficiency and restructuring programs that were initiated in 2023.\nNet interest and other nonoperating expenses are expected to be about $205 million. And as previously discussed, our effective tax rate is expected to step up to 18% in conjunction with the implementation of Pillar 2. We expect to end the year with about 207 million shares outstanding, lower than 2023 due to the $500 million share buyback plan that I referenced earlier.\nFinally, we expect our free cash flow to be in the range of $1.05 billion to $1.1 billion or growth of about 10% at the midpoint. As Ivan mentioned, we initiated a global restructuring program along with other cost savings initiatives in late 2023. These programs further streamline our organizational structure, shift select reporting lines, prioritize how we spend across the organization and further above our operational footprint in order to simplify and maximize efficiency.\nThis program is expected to result in total cash charges of about $125 million to $150 million over the next 2 years and deliver up to $200 million in run rate savings as we exit 2025, enabling us to invest in priority areas while driving margin expansion and earnings leverage despite a meaningful step-up in tax rate. In terms of cadence through the year, we expect constant currency revenue growth for the first half of the year to be at the lower end of the mid-single digits while the second half will be at the higher end of mid-single digits.\nAlso, quarterly results are expected to be choppy due to billing day impacts. Q1 will be about 150 to 200 basis point headwind and Q2 and Q3 will be a 150 basis point tailwind in each quarter, and Q4 will be a 50 basis point tailwind. Full year impact will be immaterial or less than 50 basis point tailwind. 2024 gross margin is expected to step down slightly versus 2023 due to lower FX hedge gains and the realization of capitalized third-party manufacturing cost increases observed in the second half of 2023.\nFrom a cadence standpoint, gross margin will be higher in the first half of the year. Additionally, because of the timing of the restructuring program, we expect operating margin will be higher in the second half than in the first half with Q4 being our high watermark, followed by Q2. In summary, 2023 was another strong year for the company, and we expect to maintain that momentum into 2024 and beyond.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to Karrie for the Q&A."

Hosting the call today is Steve Frank, Vice President of Investor Relations for Zoetis. The presentation materials and additional financial tables are currently posted on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. The presentation slides can be managed by you, the viewer, and will not be forwarded automatically. In addition, a replay of this call will be available approximately 2 hours after the conclusion of this call via dial-in or on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. (Operator Instructions) It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Steve Frank. Steve, you may begin.\n\nSteven Frank\n\nVP of IR, Zoetis Inc.\n\nThank you, Catherine. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Zoetis Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2021 Earnings Call. I am joined today by Kristin Peck, our Chief Executive Officer; and Wetteny Joseph, our Chief Financial Officer.\nBefore we begin, I'll remind you that the slides presented on this call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website and that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements and that actual results could differ materially from those projections. For a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statement in today's press release and our SEC filings, including, but not limited to, our annual report on Form 10-K and our reports on Form 10-Q.\nOur remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures which were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures is included in the financial tables that accompany our earnings press release and the company's filings dated today, Tuesday, February 15, 2022. We also cite operational results, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange. With that, I will turn the call over to Kristin.\n\nKristin C. Peck\n\nCEO & Director, Zoetis Inc.\n\nThank you, Steve, and welcome, everyone, to our year-end earnings call for 2021. I am happy to report that Zoetis delivered its strongest performance ever in 2021, thanks to our innovative, diverse and durable portfolio and the talent and commitment of our colleagues.\nWe grew revenue 15% operationally, which is once again above the anticipated growth rate for the animal health market, and these results were highlighted by 27% operational growth in our companion animal portfolio with 1% operational growth in livestock. Our parasiticide dermatology vaccines, diagnostics and monoclonal antibody therapies all contributed to these strong results driven by the positive trends in pet care, trends that we see continuing to be a key growth driver in 2022 and beyond.\nFrom a segment perspective, we saw solid balance across our global footprint with the U.S. up 14% and international growing 17% operationally. Operationally, for the year, China grew 25%, Brazil grew 28% and other emerging markets grew 22%, leading the way for our international performance.\nAnother major growth driver for the year has been our global diagnostics portfolio, which grew 21% operationally with significant strength in international markets and the continued launch of VetScan Imagyst, our AI-driven diagnostics platform. Based on the strong revenue performance, we were able to deliver 19% operational growth in adjusted net income for the year while investing significantly in our latest product launches as well as staffing, R&D and manufacturing projects for future growth.\nLooking ahead, we believe this momentum sets us up well for 2022. We expect to continue growing revenue faster than the market in the coming year driven by continued strength in pet care, expansion of our diagnostics portfolio internationally as significant growth in both companion animal and livestock product sales for emerging markets, including China and Brazil.\nAs a result, we are guiding to full year operational growth of 9% to 11% in revenue. Wetteny and I will discuss more details about the full year 2022 guidance. But let me share some views on the year and other updates. First, the essential nature of animal health continues to be affirmed by our performance during the COVID-19 pandemic. We have seen the fundamental drivers such as increased emphasis on pet wellness, a growing global population and continuous consumption of animal-based proteins all reinforce the animal health industry as a positive investment choice.\nIn terms of the companion animal market, people's commitment to the health and well-being of their pets has continued to drive higher spending and new opportunities for innovation, geographic expansion and increasing levels of care.\nPet owners spending in animal health remains one of the more durable trends in consumer spending as people place a premium on the health and wellbeing of their pets, even during challenging economic times. In January, the Human Animal Bond Research Institute and Zoetis released the results of a new global survey of more than 16,000 pet owners and 1,200 small animal clinics which reinforce how deep the connection is between pets and pet owners and how that dynamic relates to views on veterinary care and the related benefits of pet ownership.\nIn the study, 92% of respondents said there was no reason they could ever be convinced to give up their pets and 86% said they would pay whatever it takes if their pet needed extensive veterinary care. The strength of the human animal bonds strongly correlated with higher rates of veterinary treatment for both preventative care and specific conditions in their pets. This study and other research support our focus on advancing an innovative pipeline for pain, dermatology and parasiticide for pets, and we continue to invest in our field force, direct-to-consumer marketing and manufacturing capacity to bring these products to market.\nMoving on to the livestock industry. The need for safe and reliable sources of animal protein continues to be a fundamental growth driver for the industry, particularly in emerging markets. In any given year, weather, disease and market dynamics may have various regional impacts, but the underlying demand continues to be served locally or through global trade across more than 100 markets where Zoetis products are sold.\nWe've continued to see Zoetis livestock business show modest growth during the pandemic and recent economic challenges based on our strength internationally. We see that international growth continuing this year while we continue to see declines in the U.S. driven primarily by generic competition in certain product lines. Our competitive strategies in pricing and new life cycle innovations will help us mitigate some of that impact.\nLivestock products are a key element of our global strategy and long-term growth, and we've continued to expand our vaccine product lines like Poulvac Procerta for poultry and ALPHA JECT micro for fish as well as Draxxin KP as a treatment for cattle. We're also exploring more livestock innovations around greater efficiency, precision animal health and more sustainable food production. We've been focusing on our investments in vaccines for prevention and maintaining healthy animals, data analytics for more individualized animal care and research into other sustainability improvements around immunotherapies.\nI was particularly excited by 2 recently announced additions to our precision animal health portfolio, Performance Ranch, a new cloud-based cow-calf management software this simplified tracking of individual animal performance and health product usage and our new block yard platform, which is blockchain technology developed in cooperation with IBM to provide a secure way to share information across different segments of the animal production supply chain.\nFor Zoetis, we continue to stay focused on our 5 strategic priorities for the long term, and we are optimistic about the growth drivers we see for 2022. Pet care will remain a major growth driver for Zoetis globally based on our diverse and innovative portfolio. We see continued growth potential for our dermatology portfolio which surpassed $1 billion in revenue for the first time in 2021.\nOur parasiticide, driven by our triple combination, Simparica Trio as well as Revolution Plus, Stronghold Plus, Simparica and ProHeart 12 will continue to achieve growth as we gain market share in major markets and look at further life cycle innovations and label gains across the portfolio.\nLibrela and Solensia are monoclonal antibodies for control of osteoarthritis pain in dogs and cats will continue to increase their revenue in 2022 primarily in the EU, and we're making regulatory progress for these products in the U.S. We received FDA approval for Solensia in January with the launch expected in the second half of the year, and we still anticipate approval of Librela in the second half of the year, assuming FDA inspections are completed at a facility outside the U.S. As we begin 2022, we are seeing strong demand in the EU for Librela and Solensia and we remain confident in the blockbuster potential for Librela in 2022 and Solensia in the longer term.\nWe continue to optimize our global supply chain and manage ongoing challenges, which have been creating isolated constraints for Librela, Solensia and some of our other products. As always, maintaining a consistent reliable supply for our customers is our top priority, and we've been communicating with them about any impact to their orders. We want to ensure all pets can continue their treatments without interruption especially for chronic treatment of OA pain.\nOur global manufacturing network is working around the clock to ensure reliable supply for our customers as they did throughout 2021, and our full year guidance and strong growth reflects our views on supply. Diagnostics is our next major growth driver in 2022 with a fully integrated point-of-care business that is prime for strong growth internationally, along with the expansion plans for a relatively new reference lab operations.\nWe are making significant progress in one of the fastest-growing markets for animal health. We're adding more dedicated field force and customer service resources while developing more offerings that will leverage our portfolio across the continuum of care. And finally, we see significant growth opportunities in emerging markets, including China and Brazil, where we see excellent opportunities for both our companion animal and livestock products based on increased medicalization and other positive trends.\nMeanwhile, our R&D team, along with external partners, will continue to generate the industry's most productive pipeline in the years to come with more than $500 million in R&D spending in 2021 our largest ever annual investment for R&D. We continue progressing research to address allergies, livestock health, chronic pain and inflammation, chronic kidney disease and diagnostics through our vaccines, therapeutics and digital technology platforms.\nIn conclusion, I want to thank our colleagues for delivering another terrific year and for always bringing the value of Zoetis to our customers every day. Zoetis remains well positioned in terms of our market leadership, financial strength, investment strategies and diverse portfolio to deliver sustainable growth to investors in 2022 and beyond. Now let me hand things off to Wetteny.\n\nWetteny N. Joseph\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Zoetis Inc.\n\nThank you, Kristin, and good morning, everyone. 2021 was an exceptional year for us with revenue of $7.8 billion and adjusted net income of $2.2 billion both exceeding the high end of our November full year guidance range. Full year revenue grew 16% on a reported basis and 15% operationally with adjusted net income increasing 21% on a reported basis and 19% operationally.\nLooking deeper into the 2021 numbers, price contributed 1% to full year operational revenue growth with volume contributing 14%. Volume growth consisted of 6% from other in-line products, 5% from new products, including Simparica Trio and 3% from key dermatology products. Revenue growth was again broad-based with the U.S. growing 14% and international growing 17% operationally. Our strong performance was driven by our innovative, diverse and durable companion animal portfolio, which grew 27% operationally.\nOur livestock business, which faced generic competition on key franchises as well as challenging macro conditions in certain markets, grew 1% operationally on a year-over-year basis. Performance in companion animal was led by our small animal parasiticide portfolio bolstered by full year sales of Simparica Trio, which generated revenue of $425 million, an increase of $305 million compared to 2020 sales. Sales of Simparica also grew double digits for the year with operational revenue growth of 13%. For the year, the Simparica franchise grew 82% operationally with revenue of approximately $0.75 billion.\nOur key dermatology products performed incredibly well, growing 24% operationally with approximately $1.2 billion in revenue for the year, performing above our expectations. Our diagnostics portfolio grew 21% operationally in the year with strong contributions from our U.S. and international segments, and we will continue to make meaningful investments in the coming years to drive global growth. We do believe the adoption of diagnostics products and services outside the U.S. represents larger growth opportunities geographically and feel we are favorably positioned to capture future growth in those markets.\nOur -- performance in 2021 depicts the importance of geographical diversification. Generic competition and challenging market conditions weighed on our U.S. performance but were offset by solid growth internationally primarily in emerging markets. The modest lifestyle growth on a global basis was in line with our expectations for the year.\nMoving on to our Q4 financial results. We posted another strong quarter with revenue of $2 billion, representing an increase of 9% on both a reported and operational basis. Adjusted net income of $474 million is an increase of 8% on a reported basis and 5% operationally of the 9% operational revenue growth, 1 percentage from price and 8% from volume. Volume growth of 8% consisted of 5% from new products, which includes Simparica Trio, 2% from key dermatology products and 1% from other in-line products.\nCompanion animal products led the way in terms of -- growth, growing 21% operationally, with -- 6% on an operational basis in the quarter. Small animal parasiticides were the largest contributor to growth in the quarter where our innovative and diverse fleet, tick and heartworm portfolio was 32% operationally. Simparica Trio posted revenue of $124 million, representing operational growth versus the comparable 2020 period and the third consecutive quarter with sales exceeding $100 million. Meanwhile, our key dermatology products, Apoquel and Cytopoint, again, had significant global growth in the quarter with $360 million of revenue, representing 23% operational growth against a robust prior year in which key -- grew 27% in the fourth quarter of 2020.\nOur livestock business declined 6% in the quarter as a result of generic competition for DRAXXIN unfavorable market conditions in the U.S., primarily resulting from elevated input costs as well as softer conditions in China, loss driven by reduced pork prices. Our fish business grew double digits in the quarter, and along with the strength of our emerging markets, partially offset the broader decline. Overall livestock performance in the fourth quarter was in line with our expectations.\nNow moving on to revenue growth by segment for the quarter. U.S. revenue grew 9%, with companion animal products growing 20% and livestock sales declining by 13%. U.S. pet care vet practice trends remained robust in Q4, with practice revenue growing approximately 8% with visits growing 3% despite challenging prior year comps. Companion animal growth in the quarter was driven by sales from our Simparica franchise as well as key dermatology products. We are driving growth in both therapeutic areas by making meaningful investments primarily through direct-to-consumer advertising and field force, and we continue to be pleased by the return on investment the programs are yielding.\ngrowth in Simparica Trio was again strong in the quarter with sales of $114 million growing more than 100%. We also met our penetration target and continue to take share within the clinics. Key dermatology sales were $216 million for the quarter, growing 22% with Apoquel and Cytopoint each growing significantly. Our investments to support the franchise have been instrumental in driving more patients into the clinic, and we'll continue to invest meaningfully in this space as the large portion of dogs with dermatitis remain untreated, representing an opportunity to further expand the market.\nU.S. livestock fell 13% in the quarter, primarily resulting from our cattle business which, as expected, was challenged by generic competition for DRAXXIN as well as elevated input costs continuing to weigh on producer profitability. Our poultry business was negatively affected by reduced disease pressure from smaller lot sizes as well as generic competition while swine faced competitive pricing pressure on anti-infectives and vaccine products.\nMoving on to our International segment, where revenue grew 8% on a reported and operational basis in the quarter. Companion animal revenue grew 23% operationally, and livestock revenue declined 2% operationally. Increased sales of companion animal products resulted from growth of our key dermatology products, our monoclonal antibodies for alleviation of OA pain and our parasiticide portfolio. Several key brands are benefiting from our international DTC campaigns in Latin America and parts of Europe, and we remain excited with the long-term prospects of these programs. Overall, companion animal grew double digits operationally in every major market in the quarter.\nWe are encouraged by the performance of our monoclonal antibodies for OA pain with Librela generating $15 million and Solensia delivering $3 million in fourth quarter sales. In the fourth quarter, Librela became the #1 pain product in the EU in its first year with the underlying performance metrics being very favorable for future growth. Reordering rates were in excess of 90%, and compliance rates exceeded our initial expectations. In the past, we've highlighted the significant opportunity to expand the pain market. Therefore, we were extremely pleased to see approximately 40% of Librela and Solensia sales were from patients receiving medication for the first time.\nInternational livestock declined 2% operationally in the quarter as declines in cattle and swine were partially offset by growth in fish and poultry. Cattle declines were largely in the EU and Canada as generic competition for DRAXXIN weighed on sales. The decline in swine sales was primarily the result of lower pork prices in China negatively impacting producer profitability. Our fish portfolio grew double digits again this quarter driven primarily by growth of ALPHA JECT in Chile and the growth in poultry was largely attributed to further key account penetration.\nNow moving on to the rest of the P&L for the quarter. Adjusted gross margin of 69.6% increased 190 basis points on a reported basis compared to the prior year resulted from favorable product mix, lower inventory charges, favorable FX and price. This was partially offset by higher freight, manufacturing and other costs. Adjusted operating expenses increased 12% operationally with compensation-related costs being the primary driver of the 15% operational increase in SG&A as well as 3% operational increase in R&D expenses. Increased international advertising and promotion expense for key brands also contributed to higher SG&A, while R&D had increased project spend in the quarter.\nThe adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 18.6%, an increase of 510 basis points driven by the impact of prior year discrete tax benefits and changes to the jurisdictional mix of earnings. And finally, adjusted net income grew 5% operationally and adjusted diluted EPS grew 6% operationally for the quarter.\nIn December, we announced a 30% annual dividend increase continuing our commitment to grow our dividend at or faster than the growth in adjusted net income. In the quarter, we repurchased approximately $200 million of Zoetis shares and announced the authorization of a $3.5 billion multiyear share repurchase program. Because we generate significant free cash flow, we have the ability to grow our business through organic investments and business development and return excess cash to shareholders without consuming our cash balance or being dependent on elevated leverage.\nNow moving on to guidance for 2022. Please note that guidance reflects foreign exchange rates as of late January. We are expecting an unfavorable foreign exchange impact versus prior year by approximately $160 million on revenue, which is roughly 200 basis points and approximately $0.12 on EPS, which is about 250 basis points. For 2022, we are projecting revenue between $8.325 billion and $8.475 billion, representing 9% to 11% operational growth. We again expect companion animal to be the primary growth driver in 2022 with the continued strength of our diverse parasiticide portfolio, further expansion of our key dermatology products, the adoption of our monoclonal antibodies for OA pain and the growth in point-of-care diagnostics and reference labs. We see a very favorable companion animal backdrop for 2022. While expecting certain vet clinics trends to moderate over time, we believe they will remain above pre-pandemic levels.\nThe catalyst for growth in 2022 and beyond stem from a younger pet owner demographic and the standard of care increases, which took shape over the prior 2 years. Our innovative portfolio, geographic representation and significant investments in key brands have us positioned extremely well to capture a meaningful portion of that growth.\nWe anticipate modest livestock growth again in 2022 led by the contributions of our emerging markets. The macro trends, which makes livestock and essential business remain intact, and we believe more normalized growth will occur in 2023.\nI'd like to touch upon the key assumptions that underpin our expectations for revenue growth. Beginning with companion animal, we do not assume a triple combination product will launch in the U.S. in 2022 to compete against Simparica Trio or competitive entrants for our key dermatology products, Apoquel and Cytopoint. As Kristin mentioned, in 2022, we expect Librela to become a blockbuster product in the first full year of sales with revenue exceeding $100 million largely from the EU markets. We remain very optimistic about the potential of Solensia as well. While the revenue curve will have a different shape due to the lack of an established feline pain market, we review Solensia as a long-term blockbuster product, which suggested a significant unmet need in animal health.\nIn livestock, we expect generic competition to negatively impact DRAXXIN revenue by approximately 20% in 2022 comparable to the impact we saw this year. For the remainder of the P&L, adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenue is expected to be approximately 29%, where favorable product mix and price are expected to generate margin expansion.\nAdjusted SG&A expenses for the year are expected to be between $2.07 billion and $2.12 billion with the increase from 2021 focused on supporting primary drivers of revenue growth, including investments to support new and existing products as well as diagnostics. Adjusted R&D expense for 2022 is expected to be between $540 million and $560 million.\nZoetis is the leader in animal health because of the novel products, disruptive innovation and life cycle enhancements we bring to the market. Our internal R&D engine remains the primary source of innovation, and we are committed to ensuring it will continue to be significantly funded as a priority in capital allocation.\nAdjusted interest and other income inductions are expected to be approximately $240 million, representing a minimal year-over-year change. Our adjusted effective tax rate for 2022 is expected to be approximately 20%. The increase in 2022 is primarily related to the favorable impact of foreign derived intangible income and nonrecurring net discrete tax benefits that occurred in 2021.\nAdjusted net income is expected to be in the range of $2.415 billion to $2.470 billion, representing operational growth of 10% to 13%. Our guidance once again reflects our value proposition of growing revenue in line with or faster than the market and growing adjusted net income faster than revenue. We are anticipating a significant increase in capital expenditures in 2022 primarily related to investments in manufacturing expansions in Ireland, the U.S. and China. Finally, we expect adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.09 to $5.19 and reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $4.75 to $4.87.\nWhile guidance represents our expectations for full year financials, I would like to provide some color on the expected phasing of growth in 2022. We expect top line growth to be fairly consistent between the first half and second half of the year. However, due to the impact of generic competition for DRAXXIN, isolated supply constraints and the continued weakness of our swine business in China, we expect growth in the first quarter of 2022 to be lower than the remaining 3 quarters. In addition, the significant investments we are making early in the year to support revenue growth, primarily in companion animal, including diagnostics, along with very challenging comparative periods for T&E and other expenses, will impact Q1 materially more than the subsequent quarters.\nNow to summarize. 2021 was another exceptional year, our best performing year with 15% operational revenue growth and 19% operational growth in adjusted net income. Our guidance for 2022 reflects the strength of our innovative portfolio, our ability to successfully launch new products and establish new markets and our confidence in the end market dynamics for the spaces we compete in. Now I'll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions. Operator?"

Hosting the call today is Steve Frank, Vice President of Investor Relations for Zoetis. The presentation materials and additional financial tables are currently posted on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. The presentation slides can be managed by you, the viewer, and will not be forwarded automatically. In addition, a replay of this call will be available approximately 2 hours after the conclusion of this call [indiscernible] or on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Steve Frank. Steve, you may begin.\n\nSteven Frank\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Zoetis Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. I am joined today by Kristin Peck, our Chief Executive Officer; and Wetteny Joseph, our Chief Financial Officer.\nBefore we begin, I'll remind you that the slides presented on this call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website and that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements and that actual results could differ materially from those projections. For a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ I refer you to the forward-looking statement in today's press release and our SEC filings, including, but not limited to, our annual report on Form 10-K and our reports on Form 10-Q.\nOur remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures, which were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures is included in the financial tables that accompany our earnings press release and the company's 8-K filing dated today, Tuesday, August 8, 2023.\nWe also cite operational results, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange. With that, I will turn the call over to Kristin.\n\nKristin C. Peck\n\nExecutive Vice President & Group President, U.S. Operations, Business Development and Strategy, Zoetis, Inc.\n\nThank you, Steve, and welcome, everyone, to our second quarter earnings call for 2023 and I hope you were able to join us or listen to our Investor Day this past May. If you missed it, please check out a replay on zoetis.com. I think you'll find it worth the time in learning more about Zoetis and where we see future growth in animal health. We appreciated the opportunity to step beyond the cadence of our quarterly earnings calls and speak to you about the long-range perspective on our business and on our industry during Investor Day. We also appreciated your questions and the ongoing dialogue about the issues most important to you.\nAs you know, we shared more detail about our growth strategy, innovative pipeline and the key franchises, capabilities and investments we are making to build on our competitive advantages as the world leader in animal health. The 4 tenets of our value proposition were affirmed and expanded on throughout the day, and you can expect us to revisit that framework and provide progress updates in future investor interactions. Our goal is always to ensure that you understand how we are positioned to deliver on our value proposition, the revenue growth, strategic investments, margin expansion and capital returns.\nWith that covered, let's turn now to the second quarter financial results. Today, we reported strong second quarter results of 9% operational growth in revenue and 12% operational growth in adjusted net income based on our diverse portfolio across markets and species. As expected, we returned to a more balanced segment growth this quarter with 11% operational growth internationally and 7% growth in the U.S.\nOur companion animal portfolio grew 11% operationally, driven by our major franchises in dermatology, osteoarthritis pain and pet parasiticides. The second quarter results and drivers were more in line with our performance trends in recent years with innovations and strength in our companion animal portfolio leading the way.\nMeanwhile, our livestock portfolio grew 4% operationally in the second quarter, driven by sales of poultry, cattle and fish products, and continue to demonstrate the benefits of our diversified portfolio across species and geographies with a strong first half.\nOverall, the first half of 2023 has played out much as we expected. We have grown revenue 6% operationally in the first half, driven by strong results from our international markets and livestock performance, which were partially offset by the distributor destocking we explained in the first quarter.\nAs expected, the impact of distributor destocking in our U.S. companion animal portfolio has stabilized and was not a significant factor in the second quarter. We continue to see strong customer demand for our companion animal portfolio. For the first half of 2023, companion animal grew 5% operationally. We believe companion animal should be a bigger driver of performance for the remainder of the year with a stronger second half driven by our key franchises. While we are monitoring how inflationary pressures may impact pet care spending in markets around the world, the underlying demand has remained steady and resilient to date, and this is what we have seen historically. In the U.S., veterinary clinic visits continue to stabilize, staying relatively flat through the first half of the year, and clinic revenue and spend per visit were both up about 9% in the U.S. in the first half.\nMeanwhile, our livestock portfolio grew 8% operationally in the first half of 2023, reflecting strong growth internationally and continued supply recovery in our U.S. cattle products. We expect livestock growth for the full year to be in the low single digits operationally, reflecting tougher comparisons in the second half of the year for U.S. portfolio.\nWith the first half of the year playing out largely as expected, we are maintaining our full year guidance for operational growth of 6% to 8% in revenue and 7% to 9% in adjusted net income. In our companion animal portfolio, we expect Librela and [ Solensia ] to continue to ramp up in various markets as we build our franchise for osteoarthritis pain. One way we are supporting growth for both products is increased use of direct-to-consumer campaigns in launch markets. These campaigns are building disease and product awareness, creating conversations among vets and pet owners and accelerating our efforts in markets where DTC is available.\nWe're also pleased to have received U.S. regulatory approvals in the second quarter for Librela and for Apoquel [ chewable ]. Both have been performing well in markets outside the U.S. to date. Librela is expected to launch in the U.S. in November with an early experience trial beginning in September. As you look at the second half, we continue to expect strong growth even as we factor in uncertainty around the macroeconomic conditions and droughts that exist in certain countries around the globe, particularly Asia Pacific, and tougher comparisons for U.S. livestock portfolio in the U.S.\nAs we have seen historically in these type of environments, our global footprint and diverse portfolio provide more stability to our business during uncertain times and we remain ready to pivot resources and investments to the greatest opportunity areas that it can ensure we continue to deliver on our commitments. For example, we continue to expand in large and growing product areas such as parasiticides, dermatology, monoclonal antibodies for pain, vaccines and diagnostics and invest in the franchises and capabilities that support our future growth, many of which we discussed at Investor Day.\nBefore I wrap up, 3 quick points around our colleagues. First, I want to welcome [ Esther Bank ] to our Zoetis executive team as [ EVP ] and President of U.S. Operations. [ Ester ] joined us in July coming most recently from Bristol-Myers Squibb and having spent a major part of her career at Novartis as well. She brings diverse global experience in health care and an impressive track record of driving results to Zoetis and I'm happy to say she is already off and running with the U.S. business. I also wanted to call out the recent publication of our 2022 sustainability report. This year's report captures how sustainability is integrated across the business and shares the progress we are making toward our driven to care aspirations. This report honors our outstanding Zoetis colleagues who champion our purpose and work every day to make us the world's most trusted and valued animal health company.\nAnd finally, I wanted to mention a recent recognition from [ Fast ] Company, which named Zoetis as one of the best workplaces for innovators. Shaping animal care through innovation is something we have always done across the company and has been a key element of our success. This is a well-deserved honor for our culture and our people who continuously strive to solve critical unmet medical needs in animal health from chronic illnesses like osteoarthritis pain and allergic dermatitis for pets to emerging infectious diseases threatening the food supply. I'm truly proud of our colleagues for receiving this recognition.\nIn conclusion, with a solid first half behind us, I remain very positive about achieving our full year guidance, thanks to the purpose-driven colleagues, innovation-driven culture and diverse portfolio that continues to drive our success. Thank you, and now let me hand it off to Wetteny. Wetteny?\n\nWetteny N. Joseph\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Catalent, Inc.\n\nThank you, Kristin, and good morning. As Kristen mentioned, we had a strong second quarter with balanced growth across both our companion animal and livestock portfolios as well as our U.S. and International segments. In the second quarter, we generated revenue of $2.2 billion, growing 6% on a reported basis and 9% on an operational basis.\nAdjusted net income of $652 million grew 15% on a reported basis and 12% on an operational basis. Of the 9% operational revenue growth is 4% on price and 5% is on volume. Volume growth consisted of 2% from other in-line products, 2% from new products, including our monoclonal antibodies for osteoarthritis pain and 1% from our key dermatology portfolio. Companion animal products are the primary driver of growth this quarter, growing 11% operationally with lifestyle growing 4% on an operational basis in the quarter. For companion animal, our key dermatology portfolio was the largest contributor to growth in the quarter, posting $355 million in revenue, our largest quarter ever and representing 14% growth on an operational basis.\nWe saw double-digit operational growth in both international and the U.S. driven by strong growth in Cytopoint as well as growth driven by Apoquel and the conversion to [ Apicotruable ] in certain international markets. Our monocolantibodies, phosphatase pain in dogs and cats, Librela and Solensia posted $69 million in revenue globally in the quarter with strong demand for both products as well as the impact of the launch of Librela in several new international markets. Our companion animal parasiticides also contributed to growth in the quarter, driven by our well solution franchise, which had $103 million in revenue and grew 22% operationally. Simparica Trio also contributed to the [ parasite ] growth with $248 million of revenue and growth of 5% operationally.\nOur global companion animal diagnostics portfolio recorded $92 million in revenue in Q2, growing 12% operationally. We saw double-digit growth in the U.S. driven by high instrument placements in the quarter and disruptions from the implementation of our new field force model that impacted the prior year. Sales of our livestock products grew 4% on an operational basis in the quarter. We saw growth across both our U.S. and international segments driven by poultry, cattle and fish.\nNow moving on to revenue growth by segment for the quarter. U.S. revenue was $1.2 billion in the quarter, growing 7% with companion animal products growing 7% and livestock sales growing 5%. As Kristen mentioned, our company performance in the quarter reflects the stabilization of the distributor inventory levels that were a headwind to our growth in Q1. U.S. vet visits were flat in the quarter. [ link ] revenue growth and average revenue per visit were both up 8%. These trends are in line with expectations and continue to reflect the stabilization post COVID.\nTurning to U.S. product performance. Our key dermatology product sales were $241 million for the quarter, growing 10% and benefited from higher periodic patient visits in the quarter. Cytopoint sales continue to drive growth with vets and pet owners showing a preference for injectables. Our U.S. small animal vaccines revenue grew 20% in the quarter, driven by higher sales of our canine influenza virus vaccine due in part to a competitor back order as well as higher sales into certain corporate and strategic accounts.\nThe [ Paracatu ] posted sales of [ $213 ] million in the quarter, growing 2%. Growth was driven by inpatient demand across all channels, partially offset by a difficult comparison period given the timing of distributor shipments from last year during our supply challenges as well as aggressive competitive promotion in the current quarter.\nOur growth cadence for Trio across the year will be impacted by the timing of supply recovery in 2022, and we expect growth rate improvement in the second half. As expected, we received FDA approval for Librela in the U.S. in May. We look forward to starting our early experience program in late Q3 with an expected November launch.\nNow turning to U.S. livestock. We saw 5% growth in our lifestyle portfolio in the quarter, primarily from our cattle business where we saw significant growth in Jackson, resulting from a favorable comparative quarter last year when an anticipated midyear price reduction limited sales in the quarter. Additional U.S. cattle growth came from [ Synevex ], which benefited from our reimplementation label claim. Our U.S. poultry portfolio also contributed to growth of 11%, based on our vaccine portfolio and an increased focus on egg layer market. We also benefited from favorable MFA rotations at certain large producers.\nMoving on to our International segment, where revenue was $1 billion, growing 6% on a reported basis and 11% operationally in the quarter. International companion animal revenue grew 17% operationally in the quarter, while livestock revenue grew 4% operationally. Increased sales of companion animal products resulted from growth of our small animal parasiticides, our monoclonal antibodies for Osteoarthritis pain and our key dermatology products.\nOur international parasiticide portfolio growth was primarily driven by a revolution franchise with $57 million in revenue, growing 52% operationally driven by the lack of supply last year, which particularly impacted China in the second quarter of 2022. Our Simparica franchise also contributed to growth with continued market share expansion, especially in Latin America, Europe and Asia. We continue to see strong adoption of Librela and Solensia.\nLibrela generated $48 million in revenue with 89% operational growth in the quarter driven by strong growth in Europe, supported by our direct-to-consumer advertising efforts in major markets and recent launches in various international markets, including Canada, Australia, Brazil and Japan.\nSolensia delivered $11 million of second quarter sales internationally, driven by higher demand and supported by direct-to-consumer marketing efforts. Our international key dermatology portfolio grew 22% operationally. We continue to see double-digit operational growth across most of our major markets, driven by growth from and conversion to Apoquel chewable as well as from Cytopoint with higher compliance and new patients. Our growth also benefited from a weak comparative quarter in Japan, which was impacted by prepriced buy-ups in Q1 of last year.\nMoving on to our International Lifestyle portfolio, which grew 4% on an operational basis in the quarter. Our poultry portfolio performed well with growth driven by key account penetration and MFA rotations in core poultry markets, including Europe, the Middle East and Latin America. Our fish portfolio continues to perform well as a result of increased sales of vaccines across salmon markets in Norway and Chile.\nLastly, [ Ocado ] portfolio saw gains in Turkey, Brazil and Argentina from strong price growth and the recovery of supply issues. Now moving on to the rest of the P&L for the quarter. Adjusted gross margin of 72.4% improved 260 basis points on a reported basis compared to the prior year, resulting from favorable foreign exchange, price increases and favorable product mix. This was partially offset by higher manufacturing costs in the quarter.\nAdjusted operating expenses increased 8% operationally with both SG&A and R&D growing 8% operationally driven primarily by headcount-related compensation costs due to the timing of new hires in 2022 and the impact of annual salary increases.\nThe lower growth in R&D expenses this quarter is reflective of the timing of spend in project investments and not a reduction in our expected R&D spend for the full year. Year-to-date, adjusted R&D expenses has grown 13% operationally. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.5%, an increase of 80 basis points, driven by higher net discrete tax expenses in the quarter, mainly related to changes to prior year's tax positions and less favorable jurisdictional mix of earnings, partially offset by a higher benefit in the U.S. related to foreign-derived intangible income. And finally, adjusted net income grew 12% operationally and adjusted diluted EPS grew 14% operationally in the quarter.\nCapital expenditures in the second quarter were $166 million and continue to be on track with our expectations for the year. In the quarter, we repurchased $324 million of Zoetis shares. Now moving on to guidance for the full year 2023. Please note that guidance reflects foreign exchange rates as of late July, beginning with revenue for the full year due to unfavorable foreign exchange we are slightly lowering our revenue range while maintaining our guidance on operational revenue growth. We expect revenue between $8.50 billion and $8.65 billion, representing a range of 6% to 8% operational growth.\nWith the approval of Librela in the U.S., we are now including our projected sales for November and December in our guidance, which are expected to be immaterial to our overall operational growth rate. Their impact on the full year revenue is largely offset by potential uncertainty in China as well as broader macroeconomic conditions in certain markets.\nOperationally, the first half has played out largely as we expected with 6% operational revenue growth. We expect stronger growth in the second half of the year overall, especially in our U.S. companion animal business. In livestock, which has grown 8% year-to-date on an operational basis. We anticipate unfavorable comparisons in the second half, driven by the timing of price decreases in Jackson in the U.S. last year, and the resumption of supply of several products after outages in the first half of 2022.\nWe expect adjusted net income to be in the range of $2.50 billion to $2.55 billion, slightly above our previous guidance while maintaining our previous guidance of operational growth of 7% to 9%, driven by foreign exchange favorability in cost of sales and expenses, which were partially offset by unfavorability in revenue.\nReported diluted EPS increases to a range of $5.15 to $5.27, which is impacted by foreign exchange and a onetime gain from a business development deal. And finally, due to the impact of foreign exchange, we are increasing adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.37 to $5.47.\nJust to summarize before we go to Q&A. We saw strong well based growth in the second quarter, growing in both companion animal and livestock as well as in the U.S. and internationally, with contributions from price and volume. We expect stronger growth as we move into the second half. We remain confident in our ability to deliver on our operational full year guidance commitments. We continue to see improving fundamentals in the overall industry and remain committed to delivering on our value proposition to grow revenue faster than the market and to grow adjusted net income faster than revenue. Now I'll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions. Operator?"

Hosting the call today is Steve Frank, Vice President of Investor Relations for Zoetis.\nThe presentation materials and additional financial tables are currently posted on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. Presentation slides can be managed by you, the viewer, and will not be forwarded automatically. In addition, a replay of this call will be available approximately 2 hours after the conclusion of this call via dial-in or on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com.\n(Operator Instructions)\nIt is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Steve Frank. Steve, you may begin.\n\nSteven Frank\n\nVP of IR, Zoetis Inc.\n\nThank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Zoetis Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. I am joined today by Kristin Peck, our Chief Executive Officer; and Wetteny Joseph, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'll remind you that the slides presented on this call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website and that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements. And that actual results could differ materially from those projections.\nFor a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statements in today's press release and our SEC filings, including, but not limited to, our annual report on Form 10-K and our reports on Form 10-Q. Our remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures, which were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or U.S. GAAP.\nA reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures is included in the financial tables that accompany our earnings press release and the company's 8-K filing dated today, Thursday, August 4, 2022. We also cite operational results, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Kristin.\n\nKristin C. Peck\n\nCEO & Director, Zoetis Inc.\n\nThank you, Steve, and welcome, everyone, to our second quarter earnings call for 2022. I'm pleased to say Zoetis delivered another strong quarter with 8% operational growth in revenue and 9% operational growth in adjusted net income, driven once again by the strength of our companion animal portfolio.\nWe saw a balanced performance across our segments with similar operational revenue growth for both the U.S. and international, 9% and 8%, respectively. Our diversity and strength across parasiticides, dermatology products, vaccines and monoclonal antibodies for pain continue to demonstrate people's desire for innovative and effective care for their pets. We continue to see positive spending trends across the globe for pet care. And we grew 14% operationally in our companion animal portfolio.\nAs anticipated, our livestock portfolio continued to face challenges, declining 1% operationally in the second quarter, largely due to generic competition primarily in U.S. cattle and declines in swine products in China due to lower pork prices and COVID-related supply constraints. Overall, our business remains strong, thanks to the durability of our global portfolio and a steady pipeline of new products.\nEven as we face uncertain macroeconomic conditions, continued supply constraints, generic competition and the war in Ukraine, we remain confident in the resilience of our business and colleagues. As we look to the rest of the year, we are updating and narrowing our guidance to reflect our positive outlook for the remainder of 2022 and the negative impact of recent changes to foreign exchange rates. Wetteny will walk you through the details in his remarks.\nAs we look at the second half of the year, we remain confident in our long-term growth drivers and our ability to maintain a steady supply for customers despite inflationary pressures on the global economy and ongoing constraints for certain products.\nWe all know pet owners love their dogs and cats and pet care remains a very positive and robust market, showing little impact from broader consumer concerns with inflation for the global economy. As we expected during the pandemic, that clinic visits are normalizing over time and spending continues to show strong growth based on the latest U.S. numbers. The positive dynamic between pets and pet owners, which I've spoken about before, is proving sustainable and recession-resistant due to people's affinity for their pets, a willingness to prioritize medical care for their pets and key demographic drivers such as the increased pet ownership by Gen Z and millennials and the greater percentage of high income households owning pets.\nOur innovative companion animal portfolio is well suited to address these customer needs. Our key dermatology products continue to demonstrate strong growth, 22% operationally for the first half, and we see opportunity to expand in underpenetrated markets especially internationally and introduce life cycle innovations like Apoquel chewable tablets. We have more to come in the pipeline for dermatology, and we do not foresee any competitors for Apoquel or Cytopoint this year or in the first half of 2023.\nIn terms of parasiticides, the Simparica franchise, including Simparica Trio, is performing extremely well having grown 47% operationally through the first half of the year and is gaining share in the industry's largest category. We currently anticipate a competing triple-combination parasiticide to be approved in the U.S. in the next 6 months with a possible launch next year.\nHowever, we believe Trio will continue to grow based on a strong label, proven efficacy and the support of DTC marketing in the U.S. and international markets. Our monoclonal antibodies for pain, Librela and Solensia, are performing very well in approved markets across Europe, and we remain very confident in the blockbuster potential of these breakthrough treatments. In terms of the U.S., we have begun early experience trials for Solensia and expect a broader market launch in the fourth quarter.\nAnd we still anticipate approval for Librela later this year, assuming FDA inspections are completed at facilities outside the United States. Meanwhile, our operational growth in international has remained steady throughout the first half of the year at 8% despite COVID lockdowns in China and revenue reductions in Russia and Ukraine due to the war.\nExcluding the impact of Russia and Ukraine in the first half, our international sales would have grown 9% operationally. This is the latest example of how our diverse portfolio and global footprint drive steady and sustainable growth for the business. While some markets may be experiencing setbacks in the quarter, other markets like the U.S., Australia, Southern Europe and other emerging markets are driving our performance.\nIn the second half, we see China returning to stronger growth if COVID stays in check, and we continue to expect the diversity across geographies and species to remain strong. In terms of livestock, we expect continued pressure from generic competition, primarily in U.S. cattle and poultry products. However, we are generating growth across various livestock species in markets outside the U.S. and fish continues to perform exceptionally well.\nFinally, like many companies, we are managing through supply constraints this year with certain products. We continue working hard to optimize our supply chain this year so we can meet the increasing demand for certain key products.\nLooking ahead, we will continue to invest in the resources, DTC marketing and manufacturing capacity we need to support our future growth and achieve results for our customers and shareholders. We are advancing our driven-to-care sustainability goals that were established last year. And we published our 2021 progress update and ESG metrics in the second quarter, highlighting achievements toward our DE&I aspirations, expanded clinic goals and support for the veterinary profession. We are committed to staying on our journey to be the most sustainable animal health company in the world.\nWe also continue to invest in R&D, business development and new capabilities across the business to enhance our portfolio and ensure our long-term growth. In the second quarter, we continued to receive approvals for new products like Poulvac, Procerta HVT-IBD, ND, expand key franchises like Apoquel into new markets and acquire new businesses to complement our portfolio such as Basepaws, a pet care genetics company. In closing, our business continues to perform extraordinarily well in one of the most dynamic markets I've ever seen.\nDiversity, innovation and customer focus are our cornerstones for excellence. I want to thank our colleagues for their tenacity, commitment and resilience as we continue to deliver for our customers and shareholders. Thank you.\nNow let me hand things off to Wetteny.\n\nWetteny N. Joseph\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Zoetis Inc.\n\nThank you, Kristin, and good morning, everyone. As Kristin mentioned, we had a very strong quarter with growth across a number of our core franchises and the continued resilience of our end markets. Today, I will focus my comments on our second quarter financial performance, the key drivers contributing to our performance and provide an update on our full year 2022 guidance.\nIn the second quarter, we generated revenue of $2.1 billion, growing 5% on a reported basis and 8% on an operational basis. Adjusted net income of $567 million was flat on a reported basis and grew 9% on an operational basis. Of the 8% operational revenue growth, 3% is from price and 5% from volume.\nVolume growth consisted of 6% from new products, which includes the Simparica Trio and Librela, 2% from key dermatology products, while other in-line products declined 3%. The decline in other inline products was expected and largely the result of the impact of intermittent supply challenges and generic competition for DRAXXIN. Companion animal products continue to be the primary driver of growth, growing 14% operational with livestock declining 1% on an operational basis in the quarter.\nSimparica Trio was the largest contributor to growth in the quarter. Trio posted global revenue of $237 million, representing operational growth of 72% versus the comparable 2021 period. We also continue to experience better-than-expected results from our Trio franchise outside the U.S. where we had sales of almost $30 million.\nWe expect to continue to grow the addressable market for flea, tick and heartworm globally and see significant headroom for growth with brands like Simparica and Trio. Meanwhile, our key dermatology products, Apoquel and Cytopoint had significant global growth again with $315 million of revenue, representing 16% operational growth against a robust prior year in which these products were 22% operationally in the second quarter of 2021.\nIn Europe, our monoclonal antibodies for osteoarthritis pain in dogs and cats also meaningfully contributed to growth posting $31 million in sales. Our global companion animal diagnostics portfolio recorded $83 million in revenue in Q2, declining 9% operationally. Growth in our international diagnostics portfolio was more than offset by a decline in our U.S. business in the quarter.\nIn the U.S., we experienced a decrease in sales resulting from our new growth in market model and the build-out of a sizable and new dedicated field force for diagnostics. While disruptive in the short term, this investment is putting the necessary fundamental elements in place to position and grow our diagnostics portfolio over the long run.\nWe expect the effectiveness of our new diagnostic sales force to improve gradually for the remainder of the year. Diagnostics remains core to our business and a key long-term growth driver for Zoetis. Sales of livestock products declined 1% operationally in the quarter, negatively impacting growth across the portfolio were global generic competition for DRAXXIN and the war in Ukraine.\nChina swine products again declined due to lower pork prices and COVID-related lockdowns. Our U.S. poultry portfolio also continues to be challenged by generics and cheaper alternatives to Zoamix. Meanwhile, our fish portfolio again grew double digits in the quarter. And along with the strength of our sheep products in Australia, partially offset the broader decline.\nOverall, livestock performance in the quarter continues to be in line with our expectations. Now moving on to revenue growth by segment for the quarter. U.S. revenue was $1.1 billion in the quarter, growing 9% with companion animal products growing 13% and livestock sales declining 7%. Focusing first on companion animal. U.S. vet practice revenue trends continue to be positive with practice revenue growing approximately 5%. Spending per visit remained strong again this quarter, increasing over 7%. Visit declined more than 2%, primarily due to challenging prior year comparisons.\nIn terms of vet line traffic, it is worth noting that business in the second quarter were above the number of visits pre-COVID in the second quarter of 2019 and the trend line for growth in visits over the last several years continues to slope favorably. I would also like to point out that our companion animal portfolio in the U.S. had volume growth of 8% in the quarter. Our injectable portfolio of products that must be administered in the vet clinic also saw volume growth in the quarter. These products include Cytopoint, vaccines and Poulvac.\nUnderlying demand for veterinary care remains robust throughout the country even as people return to work. While labor challenges do exist as they do across most industries, we believe that clinic revenue will continue to grow at levels above what we were seeing prior to COVID as the standard of veterinary care continues to increase through innovation, better demographics, higher compliance and more pets. Companion animal growth of 13% in the U.S. was driven largely by sales from Simparica Trio as well as key dermatology products.\nGrowth of Simparica Trio was again strong in the quarter with sales of $208 million in the U.S., growing 74%. We are pleased to see that a significant number of Trio customers are new to the flea, tick and heartworm category altogether. In addition, we continue to meet our clinic penetration targets and take share within individual clinics. These dynamics will provide additional runway for future expansion of both the broader market and revenue growth for Trio.\nKey dermatology product sales were $219 million for the quarter, growing 11% with Apoquel and Cytopoint each significantly contributing to growth. Year-to-date, our derm portfolio grew 16%. Our investments to support our derm portfolio have been instrumental in driving more patients into the clinics and we will continue to invest meaningfully in this space as a large portion of dogs with dermatitis remain undertreated, representing an opportunity to further expand the market.\nU.S. livestock declined 7% in the quarter, driven primarily by sales of cattle products as a result of generic competition for DRAXXIN. Meanwhile, our poultry portfolio continues to be negatively impacted by the expanded use of lower cost alternatives and generic competition for Zoamix. Swine products sales grew in the quarter as a result of increased disease prevalence and favorable market conditions for producers.\nMoving on to our international segment, where revenue grew 2% on a reported basis and 8% operationally in the quarter. Companion animal revenue grew 16% operationally and livestock revenue grew 2% operationally. Increased sales of companion animal products resulted from growth of modifying studies for alleviation of osteoarthritis pain, our key dermatology products and the Simparica franchise.\nThese core brands continue to benefit from our international direct-to-consumer promotional campaigns and we remain excited with the long-term prospects of these programs. We continue to be pleased with the performance of our monoclonal antibodies for OA pain with Librela generating $26 million and Solensia delivering $5 million in second quarter sales. Librela remains on track to exceed $100 million in revenue this year.\nAs we have mentioned in prior quarters, Librela is the #1 pain product in the EU with the underlying performance metrics being very favorable for future growth. Reordering rates remain high. Compliance continues to exceed our initial expectations, and we continue to see significant opportunity to expand the pain market with a meaningful percentage of dogs on Librela being new to the market. It is also worth noting that we are observing similar pet owner and vet clinic trends in many of our key international markets that we are seeing in the U.S.\nThe higher standard of care and better demographics as well as a more rapid adoption of innovation continues to expand markets for our products, and we expect these trends to continue. Volume growth in our international and companion animal portfolio was 10% in the second quarter, and we also saw growth across our injectable products, including monoclonal antibodies, vaccines and Cytopoint.\nMeanwhile, international livestock grew 2% operationally in the quarter with solid growth across fish, cattle and sheep. Our fish portfolio experienced increased demand for vaccines in key salmon markets, including Chile and Norway. Cattle grew through favorable market conditions and price in key emerging markets, including Australia, Turkey, China and the U.K. Sales of [shoe] products grew as a result of favorable market conditions and new product launches in Australia.\nGrowth was partially offset by continued weakness with the price of pork and COVID-related supply challenges in China as well as unfavorable producer rotational programs with MFAs in Europe and reduced stock sizes in Latin America impacting poultry. Now moving on to the rest of the P&L for the quarter. Adjusted gross margins of 69.8% decreased 120 basis points on a comparable basis to the prior year, resulting primarily from unfavorable foreign exchange impacts as well as higher manufacturing, freight and other costs partially offset by favorable price and mix. Adjusted operating expense increased 10% operationally with SG&A growth of [8%] operationally, driven by promotional and marketing expenses related to key brands and new product launches as well as T&E costs beginning to return to pre-COVID levels.\nR&D expenses increased 16% operationally due to higher compensation costs, increased spending on projects and higher operating costs. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 20.7%, an increase of 70 basis points, driven by changes in jurisdictional mix of earnings and lower discrete tax benefits related to share-based payments. And finally, adjusted net income grew 9% operationally and adjusted diluted EPS grew 10% operationally for the quarter.\nCapital expenditures in the second quarter were $146 million. We are still anticipating a significant increase in CapEx expenditures for the back half of 2022, primarily related to investments in Ireland, the U.S. and China to support manufacturing capacity needed to meet our long-term growth demands. In the quarter, we returned over $600 million to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. We repurchased approximately $450 million of Zoetis shares, representing our largest share repurchase ever.\nNow moving on to our updated guidance for the full year 2022. For operational revenue growth, we are maintaining the midpoint and narrowing the range of growth to 9.5% to 10.5%, previously 9% to 11%. We are increasing our operational growth expectations for adjusted net income to a range of 11% to 13%, previously 10% to 13%. This change in guidance signals increased confidence in the back half of the year due to the continuing outperformance of companion animal, easing of certain supply constraints and an improvement in our business in China.\nPlease note that our guidance for adjusted interest expense and/or ID was changed to reflect favorable changes to interest income. Foreign exchange rates on our updated guidance as of late July and reflect the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Beginning with revenue for the full year 2022 due to the narrowing of our range and the impact of foreign exchange, we are now projecting revenue of between $8.225 billion and $8.325 billion. We now expect adjusted net income to be in the range of $2.35 billion to $2.39 billion. And finally, we expect adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $4.97 to $5.05 and reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $4.65 to $4.75.\nWhile guidance represent our outlook for the full year, due to the unique factors impacting our business in 2022, I would like to note that our guidance for growth, especially for revenue and adjusted net income will be rated towards the end of the year. While we expect operating expenses to be incurred at a similar rate across the back half of the year, we are noting an easier OpEx pop in Q4 than Q3 due to heavy spending in the fourth quarter of last year.\nAlso, in Q3 of last year, we experienced an unusually low adjusted effective tax rate of 16.7% due to favorability related to foreign-derived intangible income and certain discrete items. We do not expect similar favorability this year. Our full year 2022 guidance once again reflects our value proposition of growing revenue in line with or faster than the market and growing adjusted net income faster than revenue over the long term. Our success will continue to come from our diversified portfolio of enduring brands driven by multiple sources of in-line growth, productive innovation, and an infrastructure to develop and expand markets globally. We expect to continue to execute across multiple dimensions of our business and capitalize on favorable end market dynamics for the foreseeable future.\nNow I'll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions.

The presentation slides can be managed by you, the viewer, and will not be forwarded automatically. In addition, a replay of this call will be made available approximately 2 hours after the conclusion of the call via dial in or on our Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. [Operator Instructions]\nIt is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Steve Frank. Steve, you may begin.\n\nSteven Frank\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Zoetis Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. I am joined today by Kristin Peck, our Chief Executive Officer; and Wetteny Joseph, our Chief Financial Officer.\nBefore we begin, I'll remind you that the slides presented on this call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website, and that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements and that actual results could differ materially from those projections. For a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statements in today's press release and our SEC filings, including, but not limited to, our annual report on Form 10-K and our reports on Form 10-Q.\nOur remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures, which were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures is included in the financial tables that accompany our earnings press release and the company's 8-K filing dated today, Thursday, November 2, 2023. We also cite operational results, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Kristin.\n\nKristin C. Peck\n\nExecutive Vice President & Group President, U.S. Operations, Business Development and Strategy, Zoetis, Inc.\n\nThank you, Steve. And welcome, everyone, to our third quarter earnings call for 2023. We generated strong performance in the third quarter, driven by our diverse companion animal portfolio of key dermatology products, pet parasiticides, monoclonal antibodies for osteoarthritis pain and diagnostics.\nWe delivered 8% operational growth in revenue and 13% operational growth in adjusted net income, despite continued market challenges in China. We showed balanced segment growth this quarter with 8% operational growth internationally and 8% growth in the U.S.\nOur companion animal portfolio grew 11%, and our livestock portfolio grew 3% operational -- operationally in 3Q, in line with our overall expectations.\nThrough the first 9 months of the year, we have grown our revenue 7% operationally, as customers place a premium on the animal health benefits that our products deliver, even in times of economic and geopolitical uncertainty. As the market leader in animal health we compete in an essential global industry that has been resilient during various economic cycles, and we continue growing above the market based on a steady pipeline of new products, life cycle innovation and commercial execution.\nWe are on track to achieve our full year operational guidance and have narrowed it around the midpoint of the range, as we continue to balance headwinds and tailwinds in the marketplace. We are executing well on the drivers where we have more control, like the successful launch of Librela in the U.S., while also mitigating the downside of macroeconomic declines in China, both of which were not considered in our original guidance this year.\nOnce again, our diverse portfolio across product categories and geographies generates durable, reliable, long-term growth. We continue to expect our key companion annual franchises to be our core catalysts for growth. We anticipate strong growth in our market-leading dermatology portfolio for the year, building on the ongoing direct-to-consumer, or DTC, digital campaigns that support disease and product awareness, as well as the continued introduction of life cycle innovations like Apoquel Chewable.\nOur Simparica franchise and broader portfolio of parasiticides continue to perform well in this increasingly competitive product category, based on our innovative and highly effective products and promotional support from DTC.\nIn terms of new products, we're very pleased with the U.S. launch of Librela , our canine monoclonal antibody for osteoarthritis or OA pain. This product has been very well received by veterinarians and pet owners in the U.S. as well as other major markets globally, and we have built ample supply for continued growth in the U.S. and elsewhere.\nSolensia, our monoclonal antibody for OA pain in cats, has also been well received by veterinarians in markets around the world as we look to help increase medicalization of cats. We're building awareness of this condition among cat owners, and introducing our monoclonal antibody treatment through DTC campaigns, as well as AI tools like Cat Pain IQ, which helps vets and pet owners use videos to identify this condition.\nOur diagnostics portfolio has been showing stronger year-over-year performance in 2023 with 14% operational growth in the third quarter, and we continue to refine this business to better serve customer needs across our comprehensive portfolio. For example, we're simplifying our reference lab service and operating model in the U.S., and focusing on expanding our larger regional hubs, which can deliver 1-day turnaround and have more modernized operations.\nWe also continue to emphasize the benefits of AI technology and our virtual lab services to enhance the speed and quality of our diagnostic solutions. With all these in mind, we are narrowing our full year guidance for operational growth to a range of 6.5% to 7.5% in revenue and a range of 7.5% to 8.5% in adjusted net income, keeping the same midpoint as our prior guidance. Wetteny will provide more details on guidance in his remarks.\nWe continue to see strong underlying customer demand this year and into 2024, even while recovery in China is still a notable uncertainty. The majority of that practices in the U.S. continue to see high customer demand for veterinary services. However, labor constraints and more limited hours continue to hamper their ability to meet this demand.\nYear-to-date, clinic business are flat as we expected. We did see a modest decline in clinic visits this quarter in the U.S., while clinic visit revenues and average revenue per visit were up.\nLooking ahead, we remain confident in the sustainable underlying demand for animal health, based on the strength of the human animal bond, people's willingness to spend on pet house and the essential need for safe and secure food supply. We expect to achieve double-digit operational growth for our companion animal portfolio this year and low single-digit operational growth in our livestock portfolio.\nBefore I wrap up, I want to reiterate a theme I discussed earlier this year at Investor Day. It's the confidence we have in sustaining our key market-leading franchises across dermatology, pet parasiticide and osteoarthritis pain based on life cycle innovations in these categories as well as the pipeline we are exploring in other areas of unmet need.\nWe are firmly committed to investing in our portfolio as well as the DTC programs and capabilities we need to support our growth, while managing costs and creating value for our shareholders.\nDespite economic and geopolitical uncertainties in China and elsewhere, we believe we will continue to grow faster than the market for the remainder of 2023 and into 2024. This confidence stems from our diverse portfolio across markets and species. Our industry-leading franchises, the ongoing launch of Librela and the operational excellence and agility that our people deliver every day for our business and for our customers.\nSo thank you, and let me hand this over to Wetteny. Wetteny?\n\nWetteny N. Joseph\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Catalent, Inc.\n\nThank you, Kristin, and good morning, everyone. As Kristin mentioned, we had a strong third quarter, with broad-based growth across both our U.S. and international segments across both companion animal and lifestyle portfolios and across both price and volume.\nFor the quarter, we were able to deliver results in line with our expectations, even in light of continued headwinds in China. In the third quarter, we generated revenue of $2.2 billion, growing 7% on a reported basis and 8% on an operational basis.\nAdjusted net income of $629 million grew 11% on a reported basis and 13% on an operational basis. Of the 8% operational revenue growth, 5% is from price and 3% is from volume. Volume growth consisted of 2% from new products, including our monoclonal antibodies for pain, Librela and Solensia and 1% from our key dermatology portfolio.\nOur companion animal portfolio was the main driver of revenue growth, growing 11% operationally. Livestock also contributed, with operational growth of 3% in the quarter.\nCompanion animal growth was again driven by our innovative products with double-digit operational growth in our key dermatology portfolio, our monoclonal antibodies for OA pain, Librela and Solensia and Simparica Trio.\nOur key dermatology products generated $393 million in sales globally, posting growth of 14% on an operational basis with double-digit growth in both the U.S. and international.\nGlobally, our monoclonal antibodies for OA pain posted $77 million in combined revenue in the quarter. Growth came primarily from our European markets as well as from the impact of new launch markets internationally.\nWith the October full launch of Librela in the U.S., our pain products are now available in most major markets. Simparica Trio posted global revenue of $206 million in the quarter, representing growth of 20% operationally versus the comparable 2022 period. Growth was driven by expanded DTC advertising support globally as well as from increased field force and promotional focus.\nOur companion animal diagnostics portfolio reported revenue of $90 million and grew 14% operationally, with growth contributions from both the U.S. and international.\nOur life sci portfolio grew 3% operationally, with international growth partially offset by a slight decline in the U.S.\nGrowth in livestock was driven primarily by price, especially in high inflationary markets. We also saw volume growth in our poultry portfolio, driven by increased usage of vaccines as well as our [ antioxodio ] product, Zoamix in the U.S.\nNow moving on to revenue growth by segment for the quarter. U.S. revenue was $1.2 billion in the quarter, growing 8%, with companion animal products growing 11% and livestock sales declining 2%.\nOn the companion animal side, while vet clinic visits declined 1.5% in the quarter, we continue to see robust play in revenue growth, up 6% versus a year ago. Average revenue per visit is up over 7%. On a year-to-date basis, clinic visits are flat, while clinic revenue is growing 8%. These trends highlight the continued durability of pet owner willingness to spend as well as the continued impact of vet clinic staffing challenges. Our companion animal revenue growth continues to outpace veterinary clinic revenue growth, due in part to our continued upsized growth in retail channel.\nTurning to product performance. Companion animal growth in the U.S. was driven by our key dermatology portfolio, Simparica Trio and Solensia. Key dermatology product sales in the U.S. were $260 million in the quarter, growing 13%. [ spider ] point sales continued to drive growth in the quarter, with vets showing a preference for injectables due to higher compliance and pet owners appreciating the longer duration of treatment.\nApoquel sales were driven by growth in the retail channel as pet owners continue to rely more heavily on retail for ongoing pharmacy needs as well as retail auto ship programs that drive higher compliance.\nOur latest dermatology life cycle innovation at Apoquel Chewable was launched in the U.S. in October. Apoquel Chewable has been well received in Europe, as pet owners favor the ease of chewable administration over film-coated tablets.\nSimparica Trio posted U.S. sales of $184 million in the quarter, growing 17%, driven by increased focus in our parasiticide promotional programs. We continue to see patient share growth in Simparica Trio, even with the recent competitive launch in the triple combination space. We remain confident in our ability to compete through our superior label, strong retail channel presence, and the strength of our corporate and specialty relationships.\nIn the U.S., our pain products posted sales of $15 million in the quarter. We continue to see solid player penetration growth for Solensia, as well as an uptick in feline clinic visits and expect to continue to drive awareness of Feline OA through our DTC advertising campaigns.\nLibrela has been well received by early experience program participants and their patients during the third quarter. We moved to a full launch in mid-October. We have been very pleased with post launch performance thus far, and are confident that we have ample supply to meet our demand expectations.\nOur U.S. companion animal diagnostics portfolio posted growth of 18% in the quarter, as we continue to see positive results from the new field force we introduced last year. We saw strong placement growth in the quarter, especially on our images device.\nU.S. livestock sales declined 2% in the quarter, primarily resulting from the timing of supply on certain cattle products in the prior year, where we had an improved supply position and restocking in the channel, which drove a strong comparable quarter. The Q3 decline was partially offset by growth in our cattle productivity implant, Synovex due to extended label claims. The cattle decline was partially offset by growth in poultry due to vaccines and the extended use of Zoamix, an alternative to antibiotic medicated feed additives.\nMoving on to our International segment, where revenue grew 8% on both a reported and operational basis in the quarter. International companion animal revenue grew 12% operationally and livestock grew 5% operationally. Increased sales of companion animal products resulted from growth in our monoclonal antibodies for OA pain, or key dermatology products and our small animal parasiticides portfolio.\nGrowth in our OA pain products was bolstered by field force focus and DTC awareness campaigns in early launch European markets, specifically the U.K. and Germany, as well as the continued uptake in markets launched earlier this year.\nLibrela sales were $50 million international or 55% operational growth in the quarter, despite a slightly more difficult comparator in Q3 of 2022 due to the removal of supply constraints in our international markets. We remain confident in our ability to supply our forecasted demand for Librela.\nSolensia sales were $12 million in the quarter. Our international key dermatology portfolio contributed $133 million of revenue and grew 17% operationally. We saw double-digit growth across most of our major markets and strong uptake of Apoquel Chewable. Apoquel growth was driven primarily by the delayed itch season in Europe and Canada. Cytopoint growth was driven by continued patient expansion and higher compliance in existing patients.\nOur international small animal are parasiticides portfolio growth of 9% operationally was driven by our Simparica franchise, with Simparica posting $40 million in revenue, growing 29% operationally, driven primarily by demand generation in emerging markets. Simparica Trio posted $23 million, growing 47% on an operational basis, driven by growth in corporate account contracts.\nThe Simparica franchise performance was partially offset by a 16% operational decline in Revolution franchise, driven by a difficult comparable period in China, due to the return of supply in the prior year as well as the ongoing impact of the current economic conditions.\nAs Kristin mentioned, we have seen declines in China due to the ongoing economic challenges, particularly on the companion animal side, which were not fully reflected in our initial guidance. We continue to monitor economic conditions. However, we are not expecting an improvement this year or into the first half of next year.\nOur international livestock segment grew 5% operationally in the quarter, driven primarily by price increases, especially in high inflationary markets. Growth was driven primarily by our cattle portfolio, which grew 8% operationally. Brazil was the largest contributor, where we have seen price growth, supply recovery on certain products as well as continued improvement in cattle industry dynamics.\nAdditionally, the prior was a weak comparative period due to the impact of supply disruptions and a more uncertain industry dynamic led to a lowering of channel inventories in the quarter.\nOur poultry business also contributed to growth in the quarter, growing 9% operationally due to increased key account penetration in emerging markets.\nNow moving on to the rest of the P&L for the quarter. Adjusted gross margin of 70.5% improved 70 basis points on a reported basis compared to the prior year, primarily driven by the impact of price increases and lower freight charges. This was partially offset by higher manufacturing costs, inventory charges and product mix.\nAdjusted operating expenses increased 7% operationally, driven primarily by higher SG&A expenses, which were 5% operationally due to higher competition related expenses. R&D expenses grew 13% on an operational basis in the quarter, driven by higher compensation-related expenses as well as increased project spend for our pipeline projects.\nThe adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 19.6%, a decrease of 130 basis points due to favorable jurisdictional mix of earnings and a higher benefit in the U.S. related to foreign-derived intangible income, partially offset by lower net discrete tax benefits.\nAnd finally, adjusted net income was 13% operationally and adjusted diluted EPS grew 15% operationally for the quarter. Capital expenditures in the third quarter were $145 million. We now expect full year capital expenditures to be in the range of $725 million to $750 million.\nIn the quarter, we repurchased $250 million of Zoetis shares.\nNow moving to guidance for the full year 2023. Please note that guidance reflects foreign exchange rates as of late October, which reflect the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar.\nBeginning with revenue for the full year. Due to unfavorable foreign exchange rates, we are revising our reported revenue range while narrowing our guidance on operational revenue growth. We expect revenue between $8.475 billion and $8.55 billion, with a range of 6.5% to 7.5% operational growth. Our previous guidance was 6% to 8%.\nWe have been pleased with our operational performance thus far. While foreign exchange headwinds have been larger than expected, our year-to-date operational revenue growth of 7% is in line with our expectations. We expect to benefit from the approval and launch of Librela in the U.S., which is included in our revised guidance last quarter as well as the performance of our Lifestyle business. However, ongoing uncertainty in China has continued to offset upside potential.\nWe are expecting adjusted net income to be in the range of $2.49 billion to $2.51 billion, also slightly lower, driven by unfavorable foreign exchange. Operationally, we are narrowing our growth expectations to a range of 7.5% to 8.5%, previously 7% to 9%. Expected reported diluted EPS narrows to a range of $5.14 to $5.21. And adjusted diluted EPS narrows to $5.38 to $5.43.\nFinally, to summarize before we go to Q&A. Our broad-based growth across species and geographies despite the challenging economic environment in China, continue to highlight the resilience of our portfolio and of the animal health industry. We remain committed to growing above the industry, driven by our innovative portfolio, commercial execution and multiple sources of in-line growth.\nNow I'll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions.

I am joined today by Kristin Peck, our Chief Executive Officer; and Wetteny Joseph, our Chief Financial Officer.\nBefore we begin, I'll remind you that the slides presented on this call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website and that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements. and that actual results could differ materially from those projections.\nFor a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statements in today's press release and our SEC filings including but not limited to our annual reports on Form 10-K and our reports on form 10-Q. Our remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures, which were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures is included in the financial tables that accompany our earnings press release and the company's 8-K filing dated today, Thursday, May 5, 2022. We also cite operational results, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Kristin.\n\nKristin C. Peck\n\nCEO & Director, Zoetis Inc.\n\nThank you, Steve, and welcome, everyone, to our first quarter earnings call for 2022. Zoetis delivered a strong quarter to start the year with 9% operational revenue growth and 8% operational growth in adjusted net income driven by the strength of our companion animal portfolio. We generated similar growth for both the U.S. and international segments, with 9% and 8% operational growth, respectively. Our strength across parasiticides, dermatology products, monoclonal antibodies and diagnostics are all capitalizing on the marriage of positive trends in pet care with customer-driven science coming from Zoetis.\nIn the first quarter, we grew 20% operationally in our companion animal portfolio. As we expected, our livestock portfolio continued to face challenges, declining 6% operationally in the quarter largely due to declines in swine product sales in China and generic competition from DRAXXIN. As we look at the rest of the year, we are updating our guidance to reflect the negative impact of recent changes in foreign exchange rates, but this has no impact on our previous operational growth rates and assumptions for the year, even as we face uncertainties related to the war in Ukraine, COVID-19 lockdowns, inflation and ongoing supply chain constraints, we remain confident in the underlying strength and performance of our business.\nOur diverse portfolio, global scale, talented colleagues and continuous innovations remain the foundation of our long-term success and durability, and we continue to invest in the resources, marketing programs and manufacturing capacity we need to support our growth. In R&D, we're building new capabilities and pipeline across our companion animal and livestock portfolios to ensure our long-term performance.\nIn the first quarter, we continued to receive approvals for new products and indications, develop life cycle innovations for major brands and expand our portfolio into new markets. On the livestock side of the business, we expanded our cattle vaccine portfolio with an approval in the U.S. of Protiviti, the first modified live vaccine to offer protection against mycoplasma Bovis. This vaccine provides cattle producers and veterinarians with broader overall protection against bovine respiratory disease. We also gained approval in Brazil for Draxxin KP, which is also a treatment for BRD and combines the antimicrobial properties of DRAXXIN with the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory ketoprofen to rapidly reduce fever in a single dose. Draxxin KP is also approved in the U.S., Canada and European Union, Australia and Mexico, and it has been an important part of how we continue to distinguish the DRAXXIN brand in the face of generic competition.\nIn poultry, we received approval in Brazil for Poulvac® Procerta™ HVT-IBD, our recombinant vector vaccine that is also approved in the U.S. and Canada. On the companion animal side of the business, we received another approval for Solensia, the industry's first monoclonal antibody for osteoarthritis pain in cats, adding Australia to the U.S., European Union, U.K., Canada and Switzerland and another mAb therapy, Cytopoint, received a claim extension in Canada so it now covers both the treatment of atopic dermatitis and allergic dermatitis in dogs.\nCytopoint and Apoquel continue to grow significantly and expand the dermatology market as disease awareness and treatment options become more known to pet owners. We have a strong leadership position based on our innovative science and do not believe competing products will come to market in 2022. We also continue building our multipurpose diagnostics platform, Vetscan images with the recent addition of blood smear testing. Introduced in September 2020, Vetscan images is a first-of-its-kind technology with a multitude of applications, including AI fecal analysis, digital cytology image transfer and now AI Blood smear, all helping veterinarians broaden their in-clinic diagnostic offerings to provide the best care possible for dogs and cats.\nFor the last 2 years, I've been speaking to you about our catalyst for growth, and those continue to drive our performance. Our outlook for growth in international markets remains very positive based on a diverse global footprint and continued expansion opportunities for key brands like Simparica Trio, Apoquel, Cytopoint, Librela and Solensia. In terms of Ukraine, we have condemned the Russian invasion from the outside, and we are deeply saddened by the senseless violence being brought upon the people of Ukraine. Our company, colleagues and the Zoetis Foundation have worked together to provide veterinary care, medicines, financial support and evacuation assistance to those in need. With every decision, even the most difficult and complex ones, we're guided by our purpose to nurture the world and human kind by advancing care for animals. While we have suspended all investments and promotional activities in Russia, the continued care of pets and livestock remains an essential responsibility for Zoetis and our colleagues, and we remain focused on maintaining a critical supply of animal medicines and vaccines for veterinarians and producers there.\nWe anticipate a negative impact of about 1% to our original full year growth expectations due to Ukraine and Russia, but we are maintaining our previous operational growth rates based on the overall strength of our companion animal business and the positive momentum of expanding our U.S. pet care and diagnostic commercial teams.\nSpeaking of Diagnostics, another catalyst for growth, we delivered 12% operational growth in the first quarter. We continue to invest significantly in this space to accelerate our growth. For example, we've been shifting our go-to-market model this year and building a dedicated field force for our diagnostics portfolio. This hiring is a significant part of a 40% increase to our total U.S. companion animal field force. We see field force expansion as a key lever to supporting growth opportunities in our diagnostics and pet care businesses. We also continue to see very strong growth in pet care as we expand our major companion animal brands in markets around the world.\nSimperica Trio is doing very well as it continues to gain market share based on veterinarians preference for an innovative triple combination parasiticide for dogs. Pet owners have also been demonstrating strong loyalty rates after trying Trio, and we are excited by the ability of our direct-to-consumer campaigns and additional field force colleagues to increase interest in this product.\nLibrela is also doing incredibly well across Europe, and we remain confident in the blockbuster potential for Librela in 2022 and Solensia in the longer term. As we see improvements in supply, we will be launching Solensia in additional markets such as Canada and Australia this year. In terms of the U.S., we are still planning a launch of Solensia in the second half of the year, and we anticipate approval for Librela by the end of the year, assuming FDA inspections are completed at facilities outside of the U.S. Overall, we continue to benefit from pet care trends in terms of increased demand, clinic revenues, pet ownership and spending habits.\nFinally, a brief update on supply. As I mentioned last quarter, we are managing certain isolated supply constraints for Librela, Solensia and some of our other products as we compete for some limited manufacturing inputs critical to human health during the pandemic. We were also seeing additional global supply challenges related to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the recent COVID-19 resurgence in China.\nWhile some of these challenges are Global manufacturing and supply network to mitigate any impact to our overall business. And our commercial teams are ensuring control launches for new products and coordinating with customers to minimize any impacts on their animal care. In conclusion, we are off to a good start for the year, and we're maintaining our operational growth expectations for the full year. Our diverse and durable portfolio, global scale and pipeline of innovations have us well positioned to meet customer needs and shareholder expectations for this year and beyond.\nThank you. Now let me hand things off to Wetteny.\n\nWetteny N. Joseph\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Zoetis Inc.\n\nThank you, Kristin, and good morning, everyone. As Kristin mentioned, we had a very strong start to the year with continued growth across a number of our core product franchises. Today, I will focus my comments on our first quarter financial performance, the key drivers contributing to our performance and provide an update on our full year 2022 guidance. In the first quarter, we generated revenue of $2 billion, growing 6% on a reported basis and 9% on an operational basis. Adjusted net income of $625 million grew 4% on a reported basis and 8% on an operational basis. Of the 9% operational revenue growth, 3% is on price and 6% from volume. Volume growth of 6% consisted of 5% from new products, which includes Simparica Trio and Librela, 3% from key dermatology products, while other in-line products declined 2%. The decline in other in-line products was expected and largely the result of a difficult comparison to the prior year and the impact of our swine business in China.\nCompanion animal products led the way in terms of species growth, growing 20% operationally with livestock declining 6% on an operational basis in the quarter. Our small animal parasiticide portfolio was the largest contributor to growth in the quarter, where our innovative and diverse fleas, tick and heartworm portfolio drove growth of 25% operationally. Simparica Trio posted global revenue of $164 million, representing operational growth of 83% versus the comparable 2021 period. In Q1, Simparica Trio was the #1 canine parasiticide sold in the U.S. in terms of revenue, and we recently launched Trio in Japan, a sizable international heartworm market. Meanwhile, our key dermatology products, Apoquel and Cytopoint, had significant global growth again with $307 million of revenue, representing 28% operational growth against a robust prior year in which key derm grew 24% in the first quarter.\nIn Europe, our recently launched monoclonal antibody Librela, which is for osteoarthritis pain in dogs, also meaningfully contributed to growth in the quarter, posting $21 million in sales. Our Global Diagnostics portfolio recorded $98 million in revenue and had operational sales growth of 12% in Q1, growing across both our U.S. and international segments. Growth was largely driven globally by consumable usage and new products. We also continue to see growth in the placement of new devices in international markets. Diagnostics remains a key growth driver for Zoetis, and we continue to make significant investments in our field force, new technologies and reference grew 24% in the first quarter.\nIn Europe, our recently launched monoclonal antibody, umbrella, which is for osteoarthritis pain in dogs, also meaningfully contributed to growth in the quarter, posting $21 million in sales. Our Global Diagnostics portfolio recorded $98 million in revenue and had operational sales growth of 12% in Q1, growing across both our U.S. and international segments. Growth was largely driven globally by consumable usage and new products. We also continue to see growth in the placement of new devices in international markets. Diagnostics remains a key growth driver for Zoetis, and we continue to make significant investments in our field force, new technologies and reference lab. I think revenue will continue to grow at levels above what we were seeing prior to COVID as the standard of veterinary care continues to increase through innovation, better demographics, higher compliance and more pets. Companion animal growth in the U.S. was driven largely by sales from our parasiticide portfolio as well as key dermatology products.\nGrowth of Simparica Trio was again strong in the quarter with sales of $147 million in the U.S., growing 77%. We continue to meet our clinic penetration targets and take share within individual clinics with additional runway for future revenue growth. Federal on and satisfaction material is approximately 90% Key dermatology products sales were $194 million for the quarter, growing 23% with APOQUEL and Capon each significantly contributing to growth. Our investment to support the portfolio have been instrumental in driving more patients into the clinic, and we will continue to invest meaningfully in this space as a large portion of dolls with dermatitis remain undertreated, representing an opportunity to further expand the market.\nIn an effort to support all of our long-term sustainable sources of growth in our companion animal portfolio. In April, we launched our new pet care go-to-market strategy, expanding our U.S. companion animal field force by approximately 40% and creating dedicated and separate diagnostic and pharma coverage for our portfolio of products. U.S. livestock declined 11% in the quarter, primarily resulting from our cattle business. This was expected as we experienced challenges from generic competition for Jackson, which didn't exist in the same quarter last year as well as elevated input costs continuing to weigh on producer profitability. Meanwhile, upholstery business continues to be negatively impacted by the expanded use of lower cost alternatives resulting from reduced disease pressure from smaller foxises as well as generic competition for Zoamix.\nSwine products sales grew in the quarter as a result of favorable market conditions for producers and higher disease equivalence. Moving on to our International segment, where revenue grew 3% on a reported basis and 8% operationally in the quarter. Companion animal revenue grew 23% operationally, and livestock revenue declined 3% operationally. Increased sales of companion animal products resulted from the growth of our key dermatology products, monoclonal antibodies for alleviation of ore pain and our parasite portfolio.\nSemak brands continue to benefit from our international direct-to-consumer campaigns in Latin America and parts of Europe, and we remain excited with the long-term prospects of these programs. We are encouraged by the performance of our monoclonal antibody for OA pain with Librela generating $21 million and Cerencia delivering $3 million in first quarter sales. Librela remains on track to exceed $100 million in revenue this year. As we mentioned last quarter, Librela became the #1 pain product in the EU in the first year of launch, with the underlying performance metrics being very favorable for future growth. Reordering rates remain at around 90%. Compliance exceeded our initial expectations, and we'll continue a significant opportunity to expand the pain market with a meaningful percentage of dogs on Librela being new to the market. Meanwhile, international livestock declined 3% operationally in the quarter. opportunity to expand the pain market with a meaningful percentage of dogs on Librela being new to the market. Meanwhile, international livestock declined 3% operationally in the quarter. This decline was driven predominantly by our swine portfolio in China. As we indicated over the past several months, increased port supply in the market like to a significant decline in pork prices, which impacts producer profitability. In addition, our first quarter of 2021 presented a difficult comparative period as pricing and producer profitability in that quarter had been at an all-time high. While we expect China to return to growth in the back half of the year, we anticipate a challenging second quarter for our swine portfolio. Partially offsetting our decline in swine was growth in our fish, poultry and cattle portfolios.\nOur fish portfolio grew double digits again this quarter, driven by growth of the AlphafluxCLIce treatment product and AlphaGeLivVac vaccine for SRS in Chile. Sales of cattle products grew in key markets due to favorable market conditions and pricing in Brazil and Australia as well as demand generation efforts in emerging markets such as Turkey and China. Now moving on to the rest of the P&L for the quarter. Adjusted gross margin of 71.6% improved Advertising and promotion as well as direct-to-pet owner campaigns for key brands. R&D expenses increased 4% operationally due to higher compensation costs. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 18.9%, a decrease of 20 basis points, driven by the impact of favorable discrete tax items and settlements with certain tax authorities, slightly offset by changes in the jurisdictional mix of earnings.\nAnd finally, adjusted net income grew 8% operationally and adjusted diluted EPS grew 9% operationally for the quarter. Capital expenditures in the first quarter were $115 million. We are still anticipating a significant increase in capital expenditures for the full year 2022, primarily related to investments in Ireland, the U.S. and China to support manufacturing capacity needed to meet our long-term growth demands. In the quarter, we returned over $0.5 billion to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. We purchased approximately $361 million of Zoetis shares, representing our largest dollar-based quarterly share repurchase ever. Now moving on to guidance for the full year 2022.\nForeign exchange rates on our updated guidance are as of late April and reflect the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Please note that any update to our full year guidance are related directly and only to foreign exchange and that the ranges of our operational growth rates for revenue of 9% to 11% and adjusted income of 10% to 13% remained the same as our previous February guidance. We are holding these top and bottom line operational growth rates the same despite the conflict in Russia and Ukraine, negatively impacting our expected full year operational growth by 1%. We feel we can offset this impact with the strength of our companion animal portfolio.\nBeginning with revenue for the full year 2022, we are decreasing both the low and high end of the range by $100 million to reflect the impact of foreign exchange. We are now projecting revenue of between $8.225 billion and $8.375 billion while maintaining our expected operational growth of 9% to 11%. and bottom line operational growth rates the same despite the conflict in Russia and Ukraine, negatively impacting our expected full year operational growth by 1%. We feel we can offset this impact with the strength of our companion animal portfolio. Beginning with revenue for the full year 2022, we are decreasing both the low and high end of the range by $100 million to reflect the impact of foreign exchange. We are now projecting revenue of between $8.25 billion and $8.375 billion while maintaining our expected operational growth of 9% to 11%.\nFor adjusted net income for the year -- adjusted net income is now expected to be in the range of $2.365 billion to $2.4 billion, while maintaining our expected operational growth of 10% to 13%. And finally, we expect adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $4.99 to $5.09 and reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $4.65 to $4.77. Sales of companion animal products will be the primary growth driver in 2022 with the continued strength of our diverse prior silicide portfolio, further expansion of our key dermatology products, the adoption of our monoclonal antibodies for OA pain and growth in point-of-care diagnostics.\nWe also continue to see a very favorable global companion animal backdrop for 2022. For livestock, the fundamental macro trends, which make animal protein on essential business remain intact, and we believe more normalized growth will occur in 2023. While our guidance represents our expectations for the full year, I would like to provide some color on the expected phasing of growth for the remainder of 2022. We expect top line operational growth for Q2 to be slightly below Q1 as today business and certain supply chain activities.\nWe also expect a similar foreign exchange impact in Q2 that we experienced in Q1, where reported revenue was negatively impacted by about 3%. In addition, the significant investments we are making early in the year to support future revenue growth, including field force expansion in the U.S. and incremental DTC advertising will drive OpEx growth in Q2 at a faster rate than revenue, impacting Q2 bottom line profitability more materially than in the back half of the year. We expect that foreign exchange in Q2 will have a negative impact to the bottom line of about 5%. Our full year 2022 guidance once again reflects our value proposition of growing revenue in line with or faster than the market and growing adjusted net income faster than revenue.\nOur success is derived from our diversified portfolio of enduring brands driven by multiple sources of in-line growth, and agile and disciplined innovation engine and our infrastructure to develop and expand markets globally. We extract to continue to execute across multiple dimensions of our business and capitalize on favorable end market dynamics for the foreseeable future. Now I'll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions."

Peck\n\nExecutive Vice President & Group President, U.S. Operations, Business Development and Strategy, Zoetis, Inc.\n\nThank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our second quarter earnings call for 2024, we had another outstanding quarter, growing revenue 11% operationally and 18% operational growth in adjusted net income. Success was fueled by strong demand for innovative products, our ability to capture and expand markets and the dedication of our purpose-driven colleagues.\nSegment growth was well balanced with 12% growth in the U.S. and 10% operational revenue growth internationally even against a strong comparative quarter. Our innovative companion [indiscernible] portfolio grew 12% operationally, while our livestock portfolio saw 9% operational growth across species and geographies. It's been an excellent first half of 2024, growing revenue 12% operationally, highlighting that our leadership stems from both industry-leading innovation and differentiated execution. We remain focused on our core strategy, delivering consistent results for our customers, the animals and their care and our shareholders and our unwavering commitment to excellence has resulted in the most diverse and comprehensive animal health portfolio. We lead the industry in R&D investment, bringing over 300 science-driven innovations to , [indiscernible] including 3 of the top 5 best-selling products in Animal Health, APOQUEL, Simparica Trio and CYTOPOINT.\nWith our global footprint and world-class manufacturing facilities, we ensure consistent quality and on-time delivery. Our early investments in digital transformation, power and exceptional customer experience while positioning us for future growth. We continuously refine our commercial strategies and for effective launches and market penetration. And our powerful brand recognition, targeted direct-to-consumer campaigns experienced sales reps and medical experts help us capture new market share and win loyalty.\nOur customers are at the center of everything we do from understanding their challenges to exceeding their expectations. Scientific innovation enables us to meet their demands while creating new markets, our commercial execution allows us to defend and grow that market leadership. The animal health industry has proven essential and resilient in all types of climates, but it's also dynamic and growing, and we are well positioned to seize the opportunity. Look no further than our revolutionary osteoarthritis pain franchise, Librela for dogs and [ Palencia ] for cats. We are developing a market with breakthrough products that are safer and more effective while offering convenience for veterinarians and trade owners.\nThe results speak for themselves. Globally, Librela grew 142% operationally this quarter, fueled by the successful and ongoing U.S. launch. But again, its innovation coupled with execution. Tikelencia, for example. Despite launching in Europe 3 years ago, we reported 60% operational growth this quarter.\nOur breakthroughs are driving increased feline clinic visits, which in turn expands the total market. We, along with veterinarians and pet owners are excited about how these safe and efficacious products are revolutionizing first-line treatment for chronic pain [indiscernible] cats of all ages. Given our proven track record of building and scaling billion-dollar franchises, we remain confident about the OA pain trajectory, but we don't just launch products, we cultivate them for long-term success.\nOur key dermatology franchise exemplifies this commitment, delivering strong 18% operational growth driven by APOQUEL and APOQUEL chewable along with CYTOPOINT, we have transformed the management of atopic dermatitis in dogs, providing safe, effective and convenient solutions with over 23 million dogs treated globally and a decade of proven results APOQUEL is the world's #1 prescribed oral medication for [ Lerdagich ] and it is overwhelmingly endorsed by veterinarians worldwide with approximately 90% satisfaction, reflecting the trust and confidence they place in our market-leading brands. And we are still unlocking the opportunity.\nToday, there are approximately $20 million globally with undertreated or untreated pyritic itch presenting a vast untapped market. Take the U.S., for example, we estimate that 10 million dogs are currently receiving veterinary treatment for itch. While the majority or roughly 70% received APOQUEL or CYTOPOINT, there are 3 million dogs prescribed alternative options like steroids. Moreover, an estimated 8 million dogs are treated with over-the-counter products or not treated at all. This highlights the potential addressable market of 11 million dogs in the U.S., alone that could benefit from our safe and effective therapies.\nInternationally, the trend is similar with room for even more growth as dogs become increasingly medicalized, underscoring a significant global market opportunity that will fuel our ongoing growth. To solidify our leadership and win new patients, we are focused on DTC marketing to raise awareness, enhance medical education to improve compliance and expanding retail partnerships. Our ability to execute extends to the Simparica franchise, which grew 22% operationally for the quarter. We have not only navigated the changing competitive landscape, but embrace new opportunities with confidence and agility.\nSeveral pre trends are fueling our growth. First, pet owner demographics are shifting. They are younger, more affluent and connected by the powerful human animal bond. They are highly engaged and willing to invest in their pet health and well-being. Second, and Wetteny will say more on this. There's a significant channel shift aimed at meeting the evolving needs of these younger pet owners. We are making our products more accessible, ensuring they are available where and when they need them.\nThis combination is a crucial part of our growth strategy, and the results are reflected in our performance. In this dynamic environment, our execution across all phases from launch to expansion to defense, set up the part, showcasing we can introduce, sustain and grow products in a competitive market. Our focus on innovation and execution cuts across every part of the business to create shareholder value. In our livestock portfolio, the sale of our medicated feed additives and certain water-soluble product portfolios remains on track to close in the second half of the year. Meanwhile, we are focusing on innovative solutions for producers, including preventative antibiotic alternatives and genetics. As the demand for healthy and sustainable animal protein continues to rise, we remain committed to supporting our livestock customers.\nOur dedication to meeting their needs and adapted to the evolving market conditions ensures that we are well positioned to contribute to their success. Building on our outstanding performance this quarter, we remain confident in our ability to grow faster than the market and through competition as reflected in our raised guidance. While macroeconomic headwinds persist, Animal Health remains resilient and Zoetis' strong operational execution and innovative, diverse and durable portfolio enable us to navigate all kinds of market conditions effectively.\nWe further demonstrated our commitment to shareholders and confidence in our growth trajectory with the recent announcement of a Board-approved $6 billion share repurchase program, which Wetteny will elaborate on. The animal health landscape is evolving, and our innovations are at the forefront. And while breakthrough innovation is a cornerstone of our strategy, our success is rooted in multiple drivers of growth. We are not just launching new products we are transforming existing ones to unlock their full potential and better serve customer needs through life cycle innovations. That means taking proven therapies and developing new formulations, uses and delivery methods maximizing their impact and reach.\nThis translates to value created for customers and shareholders alike by allowing us to bring critical new solutions to market faster minimizing development risk and costs by leveraging existing safety profiles of proven products and expanding the reach of established products. Our commitment to life cycle innovation is just 1 reason we are the leader in animal health. When combined with our market leadership, deep customer insights, strategic investments and our purpose-driven colleagues, we are uniquely positioned to deliver against the 4 tenets of our value proposition to grow revenue faster than the market, to invest in innovation and growth capabilities to grow adjusted net income faster than revenue and to return excess capital to shareholders.\nOur differentiated execution and innovative, diverse and durable portfolio ensures we are not just keeping pace, we are setting the pace and redefining what's possible in animal health.\nWith that, let me hand it off to Wetteny. Wetteny?\n\nWetteny N. Joseph\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Catalent, Inc.\n\nThank you, Kristen, and good morning, everyone. As you heard Kristen mention, our ability to execute on our commercial and strategic plans drove another outstanding quarter. We simultaneously executed across product launches market expansion and market defense to propel us to a strong first half.\nIn the second quarter, we posted $2.4 billion in revenue, growing 8% on a reported basis and 11% operationally. Adjusted net income of $711 million grew 9% on a reported basis and 18% operationally. Quarterly growth was driven by our innovative companion animal portfolio. Globally, OA [indiscernible] posted $149 million. Our Simparica franchise posted revenue of $384 million, which includes $299 million from Simparica Trio and our key dermatology franchise contributed $414 million.\nOur lifestyle portfolio also saw strong growth with $694 million in revenue. Looking closely at our success and execution. I'd like to focus first on OA pain. As we continue to execute our U.S. launch strategy, we remain confident in our OA pain trajectory. Based on our experience launching other billion-dollar franchises, we know that first-in-class therapies require significantly more market development than lagging local likes.\nIn the U.S., we have reached over 9,000 vets and veterinary technicians through interactive information sessions with our Chief Medical Officer and industry KOLs. This is on top of the thousands of interactions our sales reps and medical teams have had on individual vet visits. These interactions ensure our customers have the tools and resources to reinforce the safety and efficacy of Librela and Selencia with pet owners.\nAdditionally, we are deploying capital to expand our DTC strategy. Pet owners know their pets better than anyone, and we want to help them detect the signs of OA and the available treatment options. We know these therapies are improving lives based on the positive testimonials from pet owners. The positive impact and reception of Librela are reflected in the market adoption. In the U.S., we see record penetration with over 80% of clinics now purchasing the product. No product in our history has penetrated this quickly. Reorder rates are approaching 90%, which is the leading indicator of customer satisfaction.\nIn Europe, shipment is expanding to moderate and mild OA cases that were largely untreated, now making up more than 65% of total cases. This is just a glimpse into what we expect in the U.S. over time, as Librela continues to expand the addressable market and gain market share. Despite our early success, we still have significant room for continued expansion. Our focus on execution doesn't stop after we launch a product. After more than a decade of exceptional safety and efficacy, our geicdermatology franchise is still a critical performance driver, growing 18% operationally in the quarter. In the U.S., derm clinic visits are increasing, driving volume growth across both APOQUEL and CYTOPOINT. The franchise, including APOQUEL, APOQUEL chewable and CYTOPOINT is designed to cover multiple needs across different dermatological indications and their different methods of administration suit any vet or pet owner preference.\nOur derm products also address a full spectrum of pruritic cases, providing relief from acute and seasonal conditions as well as treatment for those with lifelong chronic conditions, which make up the majority of total derm revenue. And vets and pet owners are extremely happy with the results. In global studies, veterinarians report approximately 90% of that satisfaction with APOQUEL safety and efficacy. Our comprehensive portfolio meets vet needs and the needs of their patients, and we are confident in our ability to grow revenue even in the face of competition.\nThat confidence is fueled by the significant opportunities for market expansion that Kristen mentioned earlier. First, we are targeting the $8 million in the U.S. with atopic dermatitis that are either untreated or not treated by a vet through direct-to-consumer advertising, helping to educate pet owners on the signs of an itchy dog and our prescription treatment options.\nAdditionally, in the U.S., there are 3 million dogs who are prescribed alternative products like steroids. We are confident in our ability to win these new customers through our proven safety and efficacy. We are also drawing more doses from the same patient base due to trends within pet health care, including reference injectable therapies towable formulations and alternative channel growth, increasing compliance.\nLastly, there are many markets where our key dermatology franchise is in the early stages of maturity. These markets should provide long-term growth trajectory and our outstanding international growth highlights this momentum. Our excellence and execution on our payment launches and key dermatology expansion has contributed to a great first half of the year.\nNow let's move on to our segment results. U.S. revenue grew 12% in the quarter, with companion animal growing 13% and livestock posting 11% growth. For the first time, Sales across our U.S. companion animal portfolio surpassed $1 billion in the quarter. Performance was driven by our OA payinmabs, Simperica Trio and our key dermatology franchise. Portfolio growth was largely driven by trends in retail and home delivery reflecting the evolution of pet-owner preference for convenience and increased compliance on dispensing or medications.\nIn the clinic, usage of injectable therapeutic treatment is going to offset the alternative channel shift. Our ethane mabs, Librela and Solensia posted a combined $71 million in U.S. sales in Q2. Librela generated $53 million, primarily on increased clinic utilization. As I mentioned to date, market adoption is higher than any product in our history. Thus, we are confident in our trajectory. Solensia posted $18 million in revenue. We continue to be pleased with what we are seeing in the feedline OA space.\nAs Kristen mentioned, we see positive trends in feline OA visits which have nearly doubled since our launch almost 2 years ago. Simparica Trio posted U.S. growth of 19% in the quarter on $254 million in revenue. We are entering our second year with competition in the triple combination parasiticide market, and we continue to execute on not just defending our leadership position with Trio, but growing it. Again, we do not take a launch and done mentality.\nWe posted 26% moving average total growth over the past 12 months. The majority of which was in a competitive market, highlighting not only our first mover advantage, but also the stickiness of our customer base. Lastly, in the vet channel, Simparica Trio is winning with Puppies, a leading indicator of future performance. In the absence of meaningful differentiation, vets and pet owners are reluctant to switch from a safe, efficacious product. The dermatology product sales in the U.S. were $283 million for the quarter, growing 17%.\nAPOQUEL was the largest growth driver with APOQUEL chewable benefiting from increased conversion. CYTOPOINT growth continues to be driven by vet and pet owner preference for injectable solutions, especially for chronic cases. Earlier, Kristen alluded to shifting pet owner demographics in the evolving landscape. Much of our success with Simparica Trio and APOQUEL has been bolstered by our ability to win in the growing retail and home delivery space. The convenience of these channels for self-administered products are increasingly popular with pet owners, and we are committed to making our products available where our customers need them.\nCurrently, Simparica Trio is the best-selling prescription products in the retail channel and APOQUEL is second. We estimate that over 20% of Trio sales and 1/3 of APOQUEL sales now come via the retail channel. Additionally, the alternative channel growth rate for both Trio and APOQUEL exceeded overall growth rate for these products this quarter. Growing pet-owner preference for alternative channel convenience has led to a decline in product-only clinic visits. This is why visits are not the best indicator of our performance, given we have consistently grown volume in an evolving landscape.\nOur U.S. companion animal diagnostics portfolio grew 5% in the quarter, its [indiscernible] after Q1 distributor inventory work downs following our channel strategies change. U.S. [indiscernible] had a strong quarter, growing 11%, driven primarily from the timing of supply on [indiscernible] which had a soft comparable period last year. Moving on to our International segment. Revenue grew 4% on a reported basis and 10% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Companion animal grew 12% operationally and livestock grew 8% operationally.\nOur international companion animal portfolio growth was driven by our Simparica, key dermatology and OA pain franchises, partially offset by impact in China. Our international Simparica franchise grew 35% operationally. Growth was driven by Simparica, growing 38% operationally to $59 million in sales in the quarter. We continue to see increased use in Latin America and Eastern Europe as well as price benefits in high inflationary markets. Simparica Trio grew 31% operationally on $45 million in sales benefiting from key account growth in Europe, continued focus on DTC and the positive impact of our recent launch in China.\nOur key dermatology franchise grew 19% operationally in the quarter posting $131 million in sales. We saw double-digit growth across most of our major markets, driven by higher compliance and new patients. Growth was partially offset by headwinds in Japan due to preprice buy-ins in Q1. As we highlighted earlier, we continue to see significant opportunity for growth. Many international markets are in the early stages of market development with significant runway for growth.\nInternationally, our OA pain maps grew 35% operationally, posting $79 million in combined revenue. International Librela sales were $63 million, growing 32% operationally. As we highlighted last quarter, we have lapped the launches in our last significant international markets, which occurred in Q2 of 2023. [indiscernible] sales were $16 million, growing 49% operationally. Our international companion animal diagnostics portfolio grew 15% operationally with strong performance across much of Asia and Europe. International companion animal growth was partially offset by expected declines in China, driven by evolution franchise. International livestock grew 8% operationally in the quarter driven by price increases, primarily in cattle and poultry in high inflationary markets. We saw strong growth in our fish portfolio this quarter with contributions from price and volume driven by strong demand for vaccines in Norway.\nGrowth in price and fish was partially offset by volume declines in most of our other lifestyle species due to a challenging comparable quarter as well as the impact of unfavorable rotations. As expected, the economic challenges in China persist, putting pressure on certain companion animal products as well as livestock, especially in swine. Consistent with what we have said for several quarters, the impact on our growth is expected to moderate late in the year, but continued headwinds are expected throughout the year across companion animal and livestock.\nFiscal discipline across the P&L is 1 of the things that unlocks successful execution. As we move on to some of the highlights, we wanted to reaffirm our continued commitment to reinvesting in our business and our confidence in the returns we see from those investments. Adjusted gross margins of 71.7% declined 70 basis points on a reported basis. Foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact of 130 basis points. Excluding FX, we saw higher margins due to price increases favorable mix and lower freight costs, partially offset by higher manufacturing costs, especially in high inflationary markets. Adjusted operating expenses increased 9% operationally contributing to this growth was SG&A increases of 7% operationally and 17% operational growth in R&D. Improvements in operational gross margin and prudent expense growth contributed to adjusted net income which grew 18% operationally.\nAdjusted diluted EPS grew 20% operationally for the quarter. Lastly, I want to highlight our share repurchase program. In the quarter, we repurchased a record high $533 million in shares. Additionally, on August 1, we announced that we received board approval for a new $6 billion share repurchase program, our largest program to date. The shares are expected to be repurchased over a multiyear period of up to 4 years, and the program can be canceled at any time. The company's previous $3.5 billion share repurchase program, which was approved in December 2021 is expected to be completed this year. This commitment reflects continued confidence in our ability to return value to shareholders.\nBefore moving to guidance, an update on the planned divestiture of our Medicated Feed Additives portfolio. As Kristen mentioned, we are expecting this divestiture to close some time in the second half. Our current guidance is not reflective of the sale and may be adjusted subsequent to the close of the deal. As we stated in our April announcement, this portfolio generated approximately $400 million in revenue in 2023 with roughly linear seasonality.\nNow moving on to guidance for full year 2024. Our outstanding first half performance particularly in our Simparica and key dermatology franchises demonstrated our ability to drive growth through execution across our business and gives us confidence going forward. Thus, we are raising our 2024 guidance provided during May's earnings call. Please note that guidance reflects foreign exchange rates of late July. For the year, we expect revenue between $9.1 billion and $9.25 billion, a range of 9% to 11% operational growth.\nAs we stated earlier, our overpaying trajectory remains on track. Our expectations for Librela for the year remain unchanged. We now expect adjusted net income to be in the range of $2.64 billion to $2.69 billion, representing operational growth of 13.5% to 15.5%. We are maintaining our commitment to grow adjusted net income faster than revenue over the long term while increasing our investment in demand-generating activities such as direct-to-consumer advertising. While we saw exceptional leverage this quarter, subsequent quarters may not have the same level of operating leverage due to the optimal timing of investments.\nFinally, we expect adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.78 to $5.88 and reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.35 to $5.45. In closing, before we go to Q&A, the strength and diversity of our portfolio and our relationships as well as our ability to execute on our strategic vision, continually allows us to outperform our peers. We have the utmost confidence in our best-in-class portfolio and colleagues to continue to set the benchmark moving forward.\nNow I'll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions.

In addition, a replay of this call will be available approximately 2 hours after the conclusion of this call via dial-in or on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. [Operator Instructions]\nIt is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Steve Frank. Steve, you may begin.\n\nSteven Frank\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Zoetis Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Earnings Call. I am joined today by Kristin Peck, our Chief Executive Officer; and Wetteny Joseph, our Chief Financial Officer.\nBefore we begin, I'll remind you that the slides presented on this call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website and that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements and that actual results could differ materially from those projections. For a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statements in today's press release and our SEC filings, including, but not limited to, our annual report on Form 10-K and our reports on Form 10-Q.\nOur remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures, which were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures is included in the financial tables that accompany our earnings press release and the company's 8-K filing dated today, Tuesday, February 13, 2024. We also cite operational results, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Kristin.\n\nKristin C. Peck\n\nExecutive Vice President & Group President, U.S. Operations, Business Development and Strategy, Zoetis, Inc.\n\nThank you, Steve, and welcome, everyone, to our fourth quarter and full year 2023 earnings call. Today, we reported strong full year results, driven by the success of our diverse portfolio across markets and species, game-changing innovation and the outstanding commitment of our purpose-driven colleagues.\nWe delivered 7% operational revenue growth, growing faster than the industry, propelled by steady demand for our innovative products that enable our customers and the animals they care for to thrive. With the ongoing momentum of our monoclonal antibodies for osteoarthritis or OA pain, we saw segment growth of 6% in the U.S. and 9% operational growth internationally. Our companion animal portfolio remains a key growth driver, up 8% operationally, and we saw a return to growth for our livestock portfolio, up 6% operationally. While we continue to operate in an environment of global uncertainty, our diversity across markets, species and therapeutic areas has sustained our performance further demonstrating that animal health is a durable, essential and growing industry.\nOur track record of innovation from pioneering breakthroughs to product life cycle enhancements has solidified our position as the industry leader consistently growing above the market and enabled us to create market-leading franchises. We don't just follow trends, we make markets. The launch of Librela and Solensia, the first 2 injectable monoclonal antibodies for the alleviation of osteoarthritis is fundamentally improving the quality of life for dogs and cats and strengthening the human animal bond. That's why today, Librela remains the #1 selling OA pain product in Europe.\nAt Investor Day last May and again at the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference, I shared that our own pain franchise could have peak sales exceeding $1 billion. And we are excited about Librela's performance since its U.S. launch in October, which reaffirms that view. Due to high clinic penetration, we've activated our direct-to-consumer or DTC efforts faster than any other product in our history, which we expect to provide a tailwind for commercial growth. Similarly, Solensia has also been well received with strong clinic penetration around the world with increased opportunity as we generate more awareness of OA pain [indiscernible].\nWithin our dermatology franchise, we've established ourselves as the trusted partner to veterinarians. And after nearly a decade of impressive growth, we still believe we have room to expand this market. increasing pet owners' awareness that itch is a medical condition that requires treatment, improve compliance and the opportunity to address even more unmet needs underpins our optimism. We remain confident that we can sustain growth, thanks to our differentiated products like Cytopoint and Apoquel chewable, the first and only chewable treatment for the control of allergic itch and inflammation in dogs. Our parasiticide portfolio and particularly Simparica Trio remains a key growth driver, even in the face of increasing competition. This continued success highlights our strategic execution, label strength and the efficacy of our products.\nThe performance across our key product franchises not only reinforces our market-leading position, but also better innovation consistently meet the evolving demands in veterinary medicine. As we begin in 2024, we will stay disciplined and adaptable to the evolving macroeconomic and geopolitical backdrop around the world and focus on executing our plans and continuing to grow faster than the market. Two durable global trends give us confidence in that future growth, the powerful human animal bond and the world's growing need for a sustainable supply of animal protein. Our commitment to operational excellence ensures we are ready to scale to meet those demands and navigate unforeseen challenges while delivering shareholder value.\nLooking ahead, we are committed to our track record of value creation and above-market performance. Our dedication to innovation remains the cornerstone of our market-leading position. We've consistently demonstrated agility outpacing the market to bring groundbreaking solutions that meet and exceed customer expectations. We will continue to leverage that advantage, and we're guiding to a range of 7% to 9% operational revenue growth in 2024 and adjusted net income growth in the range of 9% to 11% operationally which reflects our ongoing investments in R&D, supply chain and commercial excellence to cultivate new markets, drive growth and create value. As you've heard me say time and time again, we are confident in our strategy, portfolio, pipeline and capabilities to deliver value to shareholders and customers while performing above the market. Our focus positions us well to navigate potential challenges and capitalize on emerging opportunities. In closing, we will continue our relentless pursuit to exceed customer expectations and invest in advancing the capabilities that differentiate Zoetis.\nAs you look to 2024, I could not be more excited about our future. Our key growth drivers will continue to showcase our commitment to nurturing the world in humankind by advancing care for animal and our ongoing innovations will expand the market, reaffirm our best-in-class product portfolio and defend our position amidst competition. I want to reiterate the 4 tenets of our value proposition discussed on Investor Day. We will grow revenue faster than the market. We will invest in innovation and growth capabilities. We commit to growing adjusted net income faster than revenue, and you will return excess capital to shareholders. While there is need and demand to improve the quality life for animals, Zoetis will continue leading the way and setting the standard for performance and growth. This is core to our vision to be the most trusted and valued animal health company, shaping the future of animal care through innovation, customer obsession and purpose-driven colleagues. Thank you.\nNow let me hand it over to Wetteny. Wetteny?\n\nWetteny N. Joseph\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Catalent, Inc.\n\nThank you, Kristin, and good morning, everyone. As Kristen mentioned, we had a strong year in 2023 with revenue of $8.5 billion and adjusted net income of $2.5 billion. Our full year revenue was near the top end of our guidance range while our adjusted net income was slightly below our guidance range, primarily due to the impact of foreign exchange as well as an impairment charge related to a prior acquisition.\nOur revenue growth was broad with strong growth across both our U.S. and international segments, with our companion animal and lifestyle portfolios and due to both price and volume. Full year revenue grew 6% on a reported basis and 7% operationally with adjusted net income increasing 7% on both a reported and operational basis. Of the 7% operational revenue growth, 5% is from price and 2% is from volume. Volume growth was driven primarily by new products, including our monoclonal bodies for OA pain, Librela and Solensia as well as our key dermatology products and Simparica Trio.\nOn a segment basis, our U.S. business posted $4.6 billion in revenue, growing 6% on the year, while our International segment reported revenue of $3.9 billion with operational growth of 9% on the full year. Additionally, while China represents less than 5% of our global revenues, the ongoing economic weakness there continues to impact our business and represented a 0.5 percentage point drag on our total company operational revenue growth for the year, entirely in volume. Our full year growth was driven by continued demand for our innovative companion animal portfolio, which grew 8% operationally. Our lifestyle portfolio also had a strong year with operational growth of 6%.\nPerformance in companion animal was led by OA pain maps, which posted $321 million in global revenue for the year. Growth came from first wave European markets as well as from the impact of new launch markets in 2023, including the U.S. We continue to see penetration of our pain maps grow within vet clinics and a high level of satisfaction amongst both vets and pet owners. Our key dermatology products generated $1.4 billion in sales globally, posting strong growth of 8% for the year on an operational basis. Simparica Trio contributed global revenue of $813 million in 2023, representing growth of 9% operationally despite distributor inventory headwinds in Q1 and aggressive competitive promotions for much of the year. Our companion animal diagnostics portfolio recorded $356 million in revenue and grew 10% operationally, with growth contributions from both the U.S. and international. Our lifestyle portfolio had a strong year, with 6% operational revenue growth driven by both price and volume.\nMoving on to our Q4 financial results, which was another strong quarter. We closed Q4 with revenue of $2.2 billion, representing an increase of 8% on both the reported and operational basis, posting our third consecutive quarter of at least 8% operational revenue growth despite a tough comparative, particularly in U.S. companion animals. Adjusted net income of $569 million is an increase of 6% on both the reported and an operational basis. Of the 8% operational revenue growth, 6% is from price and 2% is from volume. Volume growth assisted of 4% growth from new products and a 2% decline in our in-line products. Volume from our [indiscernible] products was flat in the quarter.\nOn a segment basis, our U.S. business posted $1.2 billion in revenue, growing 9% on the quarter, while International segment reported revenue of $982 million with operational growth of 8% on the quarter. Our companion animal portfolio was the main driver of revenue growth in the quarter, growing 10% operationally. Livestock also contributed with operational growth of 6%. We saw double-digit companion animal growth in both our U.S. and our international segment, driven by our innovative products. Our OA pain maps were the primary driver of growth posting $124 million in combined revenue in the quarter. Global growth came primarily from the impact of new launch markets, bolstered by the Q4 launch of Librela in the U.S.\nSimparica Trio generated $208 million globally in the quarter, representing growth of 21% operationally. Price was the primary driver of growth in the quarter, followed by volume growth driven by expanded DTC advertising support globally as well as some increased field force focus. Our key dermatology products generated $375 million in sales globally, posting growth of 7% on an operational basis. Our companion animal diagnostics portfolio reported revenue of $87 million and [ 8% ] operationally, with growth contributions from both the U.S. and international. Our lifestyle products ended the year on a strong note with growth of 6% operationally, growing in both our U.S. and International segments. Growth was driven equally by price, which grew despite headwinds from [ DRAXXIN ] and price decreases as well as by volume with growth in [ Cinemex ] from our expanded label claims.\nNow moving on to revenue growth by segment for the quarter. U.S. revenue was $1.2 billion in the quarter, growing 9% with companion animal sales growing 10% and livestock sales growing 4%. Companion animal again posted double-digit growth in the quarter, bolstered by a full launch of Librela at the start of the quarter, while facing a tough comparative quarter with promotional activity and heavier-than-normal preprice buy-in at the end of last year. In the U.S., vet clinic visits were flat on the quarter and flat for the year. While we continue to see solid clinic revenue and revenue per visit growth of 6% for the quarter and 7.5% for the year. Our U.S. companion animal revenue growth continues to outpace its veterinary clinic revenue growth due in part to our innovative therapeutics as well as our strong presence in the retail channel.\nMoving on to product performance. Growth in the U.S. was driven by our pay maps, Simparica Trio and our key dermatology portfolio. Our combined pain maps posted $58 million in U.S. sales in Q4. We moved to a full launch of Librela in the U.S. early in the fourth quarter, and we have been pleased with the results our field force has been able to drive thus far. Librela posted $44 million in U.S. sales in the quarter which is at the higher end of our initial expectations. It's important to note that while we are not leveraging distribution for our pain maps, there's significant clinic stocking impact in the first few months after launch. We have seen higher-than-expected penetration and reorder rates through the end of the year as well as rapid patient share growth in the [ K9 ] pain category.\nSolensia had sales of $14 million in Q4 in the U.S. We have seen a marked increase in [indiscernible] vet visits and [indiscernible] revenue growth in the clinic. In the U.S., [indiscernible] line OA patients are up 23% for 2023. Simparica Trio posted U.S. sales of $185 million in the quarter, growing 17%. Growth was driven primarily by price as we ran promotions in Q4 of 2022 following our Q3 2022 supply challenges, and in advance of a [indiscernible] expected competitor launch in early 2023.\nIn our second quarter with competition in the trip combination space, we continue to see patient share growth in Simparica Trio. We remain confident in our ability to compete and grow in this space through the strength of our label, retail channel presence, strong corporate and specialty relationships and a significant advantage of being first to market. [indiscernible] Dermatology products sales in the U.S. were $252 million in the quarter, growing 6%. Cytopoint sales continue to drive growth through both price and volume with vets and pet owners referring this injectable method of administration. [indiscernible] franchise growth is driven by better net price realization on lower volume due to promotional activity at the end of last year.\nOur U.S. companion animal diagnostics portfolio posted growth of 9% in the quarter. U.S. livestock grew 4% in the quarter, primarily driven by growth in poultry as a result of favorable rotation back to certain medicated [indiscernible] and the extended use of [indiscernible] as well as share gains due to competitor supply constraints. Sales of both [indiscernible] and [indiscernible] products increased in the quarter, primarily as a result of increased supply of vaccines that were limited in the same quarter of the prior year.\nMoving on to our International segment, where revenue in the quarter grew 9% on a reported basis and 8% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. International companion animal grew 10% operationally and lifestyle grew 7% operational. China represented a 3% drag on our International segment operational revenue growth in the quarter. Higher sales in companion animal products was led by our pain maps, our key dermatology products and our small animal parasiticides portfolio.\nGrowth in our OA pain products was equally driven by [indiscernible] focus and DTC awareness campaign in early launch European markets as well as continued uptake in markets launched earlier this year. Librela sales were $53 million international with 93% operational growth in the quarter. Solensia sales were $13 million internationally in the quarter, growing 77% operationally. Our international key dermatology portfolio contributed $123 million of revenue, posting growth of 10% in the quarter on an operational basis. We continue to see benefits to Apoquel from our DTC awareness campaigns across several international markets, and conversion to Apoquel chewable has been positive. [indiscernible] Cytopoint continues to benefit from higher rates of conversion from Apoquel and overall market growth. Our international small animal parasiticides portfolio grew 4% operationally, driven by our Simparica franchise with Simparica posting $48 million in revenue and growing 32% on an operational basis in the quarter, driven primarily by price, a strong price season and demand generation in emerging markets.\nSimparica Trio contributed $23 million internationally, growing 72% operationally driven by high peak season sales in Australia and continued uptake in Europe driven by key account penetration and field force effectiveness. This growth was partially offset by a 33% operational decline in our revolution franchise which generates a high proportion of sales in China, where we had a tough comparative quarter due to the return of supply in Q4 of 2022 as well as the ongoing impact of the current economic conditions. Continuing onto international livestock, which grew 7% operationally driven primarily by price increases in all species, especially in high inflationary markets. Our poultry portfolio also benefited from favorable MFA rotations in certain markets. China had an unfavorable impact on our international livestock sales in the quarter, particularly in our [indiscernible] portfolio.\nNow moving on to the rest of the P&L for the quarter. Adjusted gross margin of 67.1% decreased 100 basis points on a reported basis compared to the prior year. On an operational basis, adjusted gross margins decreased by 20 basis points, resulting primarily from higher manufacturing costs, which were partially offset by price increases and lower freight costs. Adjusted operating expenses increased 11% operationally, driven primarily by higher SG&A expenses, which was 10% operationally primarily due to higher competition related expenses as well as a charitable contribution related to the funding of the Zoetis Foundation. R&D expenses grew 17% on an operational basis, driven by higher compensation-related expenses as well as portfolio progression of key pipeline projects. Finally, Other income and deductions were higher in the quarter due to an impairment charge related to an acquisition.\nThe adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 18.8%, an a decrease of 200 basis points, primarily due to higher net dispute tax benefits in the quarter, a higher benefit in the U.S. related to foreign-derived intangible income and a more favorable jurisdictional mix of earnings. Adjusted net income grew 6% operationally and adjusted diluted EPS grew 7% operationally for the quarter. Capital expenditures in the fourth quarter were $198 million. For the full year, we had capital expenditures of $732 million. Lastly, we continue to return excess capital to shareholders. For the year, we have returned approximately $1.8 billion to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. In December, we announced a 15% annual dividend increase. continuing our commitment to grow our dividend at or faster than the growth in adjusted net income.\nNow moving on to our guidance for the full year 2024. Please note that guidance reflects foreign exchange rates as of late January. We are expecting foreign exchange to have an incredible impact on our growth versus the prior year. At net revenue, we expect foreign exchange to negatively impact our growth by 90 basis points, with the impact being more pronounced early in the year and decreasing later in the year. On adjusted net income, we expect FX to negatively impact our growth by 150 basis points. with significant unfavorable impact in the first half of the year, transitioning to slight favorability in the second half of the year. As a reminder, we do not actively forecast FX. So these estimates assume rates remain where they were as of late January.\nFor 2024, we are projecting revenue between $9.075 billion and [ $9.225 billion ], representing a range of 7% to 9% operational growth with growth across both price and volume. We expect companion animal to be the primary growth driver in 2024. With the expected impact of the U.S. launch of Librela, we expect to see robust growth from our pain maps both in the U.S. and internationally. Our current clinic penetration levels for Librela in the U.S. are exceeding our expectations. And as Kristin mentioned, we have launched our DTC efforts ahead of schedule to drive increased pet owner awareness. Even with the expectation of competitive entrants, we anticipate mid- to high single-digit growth in both Simparica Trio and our key dermatology portfolio. For livestock, 2023 exceeded our expectations. Our growth in the year benefited from several tailwinds, including improvements in supply in certain markets as well as competitive out of stocks. While our outlook for the upcoming year is more optimistic than it was as we enter 2023, we do expect our growth rate to normalize and be in line with lifestyle industry growth.\nI'd like to briefly touch upon the key assumptions that underpin our expectations for revenue growth. For companion animal, we are not projecting significant change to the current vet clinic trends. We expect U.S. visits to grow flat to 1% and expect to see growth in therapeutic visits aided by the impact of our pain products. For an animal parasiticides, we continue to expect meaningful growth from Simparica Trio. We expect new entrants will help continue to drive the conversion from topicals and collars to triple combination [indiscernible] parasiticides, a space where we are the market leader. In other key dermatology products, we are prepared for competition and confident in our ability to defend and grow our share through our 3 differentiated dermatology products, the strength of our customer relationships and the expertise we have gained from almost 10 years in the space. Lastly, while we are not assuming a change in the current economic situation in China, we do expect a headwind to growth, especially in the first half as the situation worsened over the course of 2023.\nNow moving on to the rest of the P&L. Adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenue is expected to be approximately 29.5%. We continue to make investments to ensure we can support expected future growth in our portfolio, especially in monoclonal antibodies. These investments are driving short-term margin impacts from lower state utilization. This is offset by price increases and favorable product mix. Adjusted SG&A expenses for the year are expected to be between $2.17 billion and $2.22 billion, with the increase in 2023, focused on supporting primary drivers of revenue growth. Adjusted R&D expenses for 2024 is expected to be between $665 million and $675 million. Spend is driven by the advancement of key pipeline projects as well as higher competition related expenses.\nAdjusted interest expense and other income and deductions is expected to be approximately $210 million. This is significantly higher than the prior year as our growth here is negatively impacted by the nonrecurring royalty settlement income we reflected in Q1 of 2023 as well as the impact of lower interest income. Our adjusted effective tax rate for 2024 is expected to be in the range of 20% to 21%. Adjusted net income is expected to be in the range of $2.65 billion to $2.70 billion, representing operational growth of 9% to 11%. Our guidance once again reflects our value proposition of growing revenue in line with or faster than the market. and growing adjusted net income faster than revenue. We expect adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.74 to $5.84 and reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.34 to $5.44. And finally, we are anticipating capital expenditures in 2024 to be in the range of $800 million to $850 million. These levels remain elevated compared to historical spend levels as we continue to make investments to support our future growth.\nTo summarize, 2023 was another strong year. even with distributor inventory headwinds entering the year and a challenging economic environment, especially in China. We again outperformed the market. We continue to grow share even in spaces where we face new competition, and we remain confident in our ability to expand existing markets and create new ones in the future. As we move into 2024, our guidance highlights our ability to again grow faster than the market, driven by our innovative product portfolio and multiple sources of growth as well as our ability to grow our bottom line faster than our pipeline while making meaningful investments for the future and returning significant excess capital to our shareholders.\nNow I'll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions.

We also cite operational results, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Kristin.\n\nKristin C. Peck\n\nCEO & Director, Zoetis Inc.\n\nThank you, Steve, and welcome, everyone, to our fourth quarter and full year 2022 earnings call. Today, we reported strong full year results for 2022, in line with the high end of our guidance from November, and thanks to our diverse portfolio, global scale and talented colleagues.\nOur 8% operational revenue growth for the year was driven by our innovative companion animal portfolio, which grew 14% operationally while our livestock portfolio declined 2% operationally, primarily due to generic competition and market challenges, especially in the U.S. Thanks to our broad mobile scale and diversity, we delivered well-balanced operational growth across our U.S. and international segments, which grew 7% and 9%, respectively.\nFor the year, we generated operational growth in all of our top 13 markets despite the economic challenges, continued COVID recovery and political uncertainty created by the war in Ukraine.\nReflecting our long-standing value proposition, we grew our adjusted net income faster than sales for the year with an operational increase of 11% for the full year and we use this performance and financial strength to continue investing in the R&D, manufacturing capacity and sales and marketing resources to support our future growth and pipeline.\nAs we begin 2023, we will stay adaptable to the evolving macroeconomic factors and geopolitical tensions around the world and focus on executing our plans. We remain very confident in the fundamental and resilient global demand for animal care. And most importantly, we are confident in Zoetis' ability to continue delivering solid sustainable growth as we resolve our prior supply constraints and build share of our market-leading franchises.\nLooking ahead, we are committed to our track record of value creation and above-market performance even in the face of today's economic uncertainty, we are well positioned with our strategic priorities and capabilities to expand in large and growing product areas like parasiticides, dermatology products, monoclonal antibodies, vaccines and diagnostics.\nWe are guiding to a range of 6% to 8% operational growth for revenue in 2023 and adjusted net income growth in the range of 7% to 9% operationally, which reflects our increased investment plans for R&D and manufacturing to support growth. As the world leader in animal health, a market that has grown on average of 5% to 6% through various economic cycles over the last 2 decades, we feel very positive about how our portfolio, pipeline and strategy can drive long-term sustainable growth and create value for our customers and shareholders.\nWetteny will discuss more details about the 4Q results and full year 2023 guidance, but let me provide some additional perspective on our business and set the stage for some of our growth drivers for the year. First, we have remained the world leader in animal health over the last decade, outperforming the market and bringing groundbreaking innovation to veterinarians, producers and pet owners who care for animals.\nWe marked our 10-year anniversary as a public company on February 1, a decade, which saw a spring more than 2,000 new products and life cycle innovations to market, build a diverse portfolio, featuring market-leading franchises and 15 current blockbusters generate consistent above-market revenue growth and deliver a total shareholder return of more than 500% all while increasing our market cap from $16 billion in 2013 to about $75 billion today. While we celebrate those accomplishments, I'm even more excited about where we can go in the next decade. And by the talented colleagues, innovative pipeline and best-in-class capabilities we have brought together at Zoetis.\nOur colleagues purpose-driven mindset and steady performance in the face of adversity give me confidence in the continued execution, innovation, growth and durability of our business. As we turn to 2023, we're focused on 5 key growth catalysts for the year. In dermatology, we see excellent growth opportunities even after nearly a decade of game-changing innovation that began with the introduction of Apoquel in 2014 and has continued with the success of our first monoclonal antibody, Cytopoint, as well as recent life cycle innovations like Apoquel chewable.\nWe continue to see even more opportunity to grow and expand in this market. In pet parasiticides, the largest single product area in animal health, we continue to gain share and are now the second largest in revenue for this category. We've improved supply in 2023, we expect to continue expanding share in this market and supporting our diverse global portfolio beating Simparica Trio, our triple combination product.\nIn the area of pain, we are off to a great start with our 2 monoclonal antibodies for osteoarthritis pain, Librela for dogs, which became our latest blockbuster in 2022 and Solensia for cats. We are, once again, revolutionizing care in this category and seeing very positive early reaction to both products in their large markets as we continue to expand geographies and supply.\nIn terms of the U.S. approval for Librela, we remain confident in receiving approval in the first half of '23 with a leasing plan for late in the year.\nIn Diagnostics, we continue to generate solid above-market growth in international markets of all our go-to-market model in the U.S. and drive greater global adoption for VETSCAN IMAGYST, our AI-based diagnostics platform.\nAnd finally, as population growth and economic mobility drive more demand for animal protein and pets, we see major opportunities in fast-growing emerging markets outside the U.S., where our portfolio is well suited to meet those evolving needs. Overall, our business continues to be weighted towards higher-growth, innovation-driven areas in companion animal, and these will remain our growth drivers for the foreseeable future.\nMeanwhile, our livestock portfolio will remain a valuable cash-generating piece of our business as we continue to recover in the U.S. from generic competition and show solid growth in emerging markets. As always, we will stay disciplined yet adaptable, and our approach to the new market opportunities, potential challenges and economic shifts that could occur.\nAnd in conclusion, Zoetis remains well positioned in terms of our market leadership, financial strength, investment strategies and diverse portfolio to deliver sustainable growth in 2023.\nThank you, and I'll hand this off to Wetteny.\n\nWetteny N. Joseph\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Zoetis Inc.\n\nThank you, Kristin, and good morning, everyone. As Kristin mentioned, we had a strong year in 2022 with revenue of $8.1 billion and adjusted net income of $2.3 billion both in line with the high end of our November full year guidance range. Full year revenue grew 4% on a reported basis and 8% operationally with adjusted net income increasing 3% on a reported basis and 11% operationally.\nLooking deeper into the operational growth for the year. Price contributed 3% to full year operational revenue growth with volume contributing 5%. Volume growth consisted of 4% from new products, including Simparica Trio and our monoclonal antibodies, Librela and Solensia, and 2% from key dermatology products, partially offset by a decline of 1% from other In-Line products.\nRevenue growth was broad-based with positive operational growth in each of our top 13 markets, which make up approximately 85% of our total revenues with international growing 9% operationally and the U.S. growing 7%. Our growth was driven by continued demand for our innovative new products in our companion animal portfolio, which grew 14% operationally.\nOur companion animal portfolio now makes up 64% of our global revenues. This growth was partially offset by our livestock business, which declined 2% operationally, primarily due to generic competition, supply constraints as well as challenging market conditions in certain geographies.\nPerformance in companion animal was driven by our small animal parasiticide portfolio, which grew 20% on an operational basis. Simparica Trio generated $744 million in sales, growing 58% on an operational basis. Our Simparica franchise reached $1 billion in global revenue for the first time in 2022. Our key dermatology products generated $1.3 billion in sales posting strong growth of 17% operationally with double-digit growth in both international and the U.S. Derm grew -- growth in our international markets was especially strong at 27% operationally.\nWe continue to see solid growth in our monoclonal antibodies for osteoarthritis pain. As expected, sales of Librela eclipsed the $100 million mark on the year, marking Zoetis' 15th blockbuster product. We look forward to Librela's expected launch in the U.S. in late 2023. Solensia contributed $30 million in sales in 2022, primarily from international markets, with solid plan penetration in the U.S. after a launch late in the year.\nOur companion animal diagnostics portfolio declined 2% operationally in the year, with declines in the U.S., partially offset by growth internationally. Our livestock business declined 2% on an operational basis. Our portfolio continues to be challenged by generic and cheaper alternatives to DRAXXIN in cattle as well as Zoamix in poultry. We do expect the generic impact to begin to moderate in 2023. Additional declines were driven by supply challenges on certain lifestyle products as well as unfavorable market conditions, especially the U.S. cattle and China swine markets.\nMoving on to our Q4 financial results, which was another strong quarter. We closed Q4 with revenue of $2 billion, representing an increase of 4% on a reported basis and 9% on an operational basis. Adjusted net income of $539 million is an increase of 14% on a reported basis and 27% operationally. Of the 9% operational revenue growth, 3% from price and 6% from volume. Volume growth consisted of 3% from new products, which includes Simparica Trio as well as Librela and Solensia and 2% from key dermatology products, while other in-line products grew 1%.\nCompanion animal products grew 15% operationally while our livestock portfolio was flat in the quarter. Simparica Trio was the largest contributor to growth in the quarter, posting global revenue of $171 million, representing operational growth of 39% for the quarter. We expect Simparica Trio to continue to grow the addressable market for fleet taking hardware globally and drive the conversion from collar and top parasiticides to oral combination products. These dynamics will provide additional run rate for future expansion of the broader market and revenue growth for Trio even once competing super combination products enter the market.\nOur key dermatology products, Apoquel and Cytopoint, had solid global growth in the quarter, posting $347 million of revenue, representing 14% operational growth against a robust prior year in which key derm grew 23% operationally in the fourth quarter of 2021.\nOur monoclonal antibodies osteoarthritis pain in dogs and cats continue to grow posting $39 million of revenue in the quarter, primarily in international markets. Meanwhile, sales of livestock products were flat on an operational basis in the quarter, with growth in fish and poultry offset by the impact of generics and supply constraints on cattle and swine products.\nNow moving on to revenue growth by segment for the quarter. U.S. revenue was $1.1 billion in the quarter, growing 7% with companion animal sales growing 12% and livestock sales declining by 6%.\nFocusing first on companion animal, we returned to double-digit growth in the quarter, as we resolve the majority of our supply issues from earlier in the year. In the U.S. veterinary practice revenue is growing approximately 6% and spending per visit remained strong again this quarter, increasing 10% despite a 4% decline in clinic visits in the quarter.\nThe visit decline reflects comparison to the peak visit numbers in 2021, driven by pandemic after effects and increased adoption of pets as well as the impact of veterinary workforce challenges that have limited some clinic capacities. Absolute clinic visits remain above prepandemic levels.\nWe continue to see growth in the retail segment outpacing other channels. In Q4, sales to our retail partners grew by 49%. Simparica Trio continues to grow -- to drive growth in the quarter with sales of $158 million in the U.S., growing 39%. With the supply constraints from earlier in the year largely resolved, we were able to leverage promotional efforts to drive growth and regain market share in the quarter.\nKey dermatology product sales in the U.S. were $239 million for the quarter, growing 11% with Apoquel and Cytopoint, each growing double digits. We expect to continue the expansion of the market for the foreseeable future. U.S. livestock declined 6% in the quarter as expected, with sales of cattle products impacted by supply restocking for certain products in the third quarter of 2022 as well as the impact of generic competition in cattle and poultry.\nMoving on to our International segment, where revenue was flat on a reported basis and grew 12% operationally in the quarter. International companion animal revenue grew 21% operationally and livestock grew 4% operationally. Increased sales of companion animal products resulted from growth in our parasiticide portfolio, our key dermatology products and our monoclonal antibodies for alleviation of osteoarthritis pain.\nOur international small animal parasiticide portfolio had a very strong quarter. Growth was driven by revolution franchise, which rebounded well from supply challenges, especially in China. Our key dermatology products contributed $108 million of revenue and grew 22% on an operational basis in the quarter, with growth in Cytopoint across all key markets and continued double-digit growth of Apoquel.\nWe continue to be pleased with the performance of our OA pain portfolio with Librela generating $26 million and Solensia delivering $7 million in fourth quarter sales internationally. Librela sales in the quarter dipped slightly below the prior quarter due to the removal of supply allocation in certain markets, which led to higher inventory levels at the end of Q3. We expect to see significant contribution to growth in 2023 coming from Librela across our International segment.\nMoving on to our International Livestock segment, which grew 4% operationally in the quarter. Our fish portfolio grew 25% operationally due to increased demand for vaccines in key salmon markets, including Norway and Chile. Sales of poultry products grew due to increased demand for poultry reporting. Growth was partially offset by swine sales, which declined due to supply constraints in certain vaccines across international. The slight decline was partially offset by growth in China, driven by a weak comparative quarter in the prior year and improved swine market conditions.\nNow moving on to the rest of the P&L for the quarter. Adjusted gross margins of 68.1% decreased 150 basis points on a reported basis compared to the prior year, resulting primarily from unfavorable foreign exchange impacts. Operationally, gross margin declined 60 basis points, driven by higher inventory charges as well as higher manufacturing and freight costs, which were partially offset by favorable price and mix.\nOperationally, adjusted operating expenses decreased 6% with SG&A declining 9% driven by lower compensation-related expenses and lower advertising and promotion, partially offset by higher freight and logistics related expenses. R&D expenses increased 10% operationally due to higher compensation costs and higher project spend. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 20.8%, an increase of 220 basis points, primarily due to lower net discrete tax benefits in the quarter and a lower benefit in the U.S. related to foreign-derived intangible income.\nAdjusted net income grew 27% operationally and adjusted diluted EPS grew 30% operationally for the quarter. Capital expenditures in the fourth quarter were $171 million. In the quarter, we repurchased approximately $400 million of Zoetis shares and returned over $0.5 billion to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. For the year, we have repurchased almost $1.6 billion of Zoetis shares and returned over $2.2 billion to shareholders. In December, we announced a 15% annual dividend increase, continuing our commitment to grow our dividend at or faster than the growth in adjusted net income.\nNow moving on to our guidance for the full year 2023. Please note that guidance reflects foreign exchange rates as of late January. We are expecting foreign exchange to have a minimal impact versus the prior year, with the full year impact neutral at revenue and slightly accretive at adjusted net income. The foreign exchange impact in the first half will be unfavorable versus prior year, particularly in the first quarter.\nIn the second half of the year, foreign exchange is expected to be favorable based on the late January exchange rates. For 2023, we are projecting revenue between $8.575 billion and $8.725 billion, representing a range of 6% to 8% operational growth. Volume will be 1% to 2% at the low end of our guidance range and 3% to 4% at the high end. We again expect companion animal to be the primary growth driver in 2023 with the continued strength of our diverse Simparica Trio portfolio, the adoption of our monoclonal antibodies for OA pain and further expansion of our key dermatology products.\nDespite the decline in vet planning visits last year, industry fundamentals remain strong. Business remain above pre-COVID levels and clinic revenue is at an all-time high as the standard of care continues to increase. We anticipate modest livestock declines in 2023, driven by the generic impact on DRAXXIN sales, particularly in the first half as well as unfavorable market conditions in U.S. cattle. These declines will be partially offset by growth in poultry, driven by increased demand for poultry protein and new product launches as well as fish.\nThe fundamental trends which make livestock an essential business remain intact. I'd like to touch upon the key assumptions that underpin our expectation for revenue growth. For companion animal, we assume a tribal combination product will launch in the U.S. in the first half of 2023 to compete against Simparica Trio. We expect this entrant will help Trio drive the conversion from topicals and collars to triple combination or parasiticides and still project significant growth for Trio. We do not expect competitive entrants in 2023 for our key dermatology products, Apoquel and Cytopoint.\nWe expect another year of robust growth of our key derm portfolio coming from continued expansion of the dermatology market and price. We are excited about the continued growth in our OA franchise and plan to launch in several new markets next year.\nFor the remainder of the P&L, adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenue is expected to be in the range of 29.5% to 30%, where favorable foreign exchange price increases and product mix are partially offset by higher input costs.\nAdjusted SG&A expenses for the year are expected to be between $2.06 billion and $2.1 billion, with the increase from 2022 focused on supporting primary drivers of revenue growth. Adjusted R&D expenses for 2023 is expected to be between $635 million and $660 million. R&D spend can fluctuate year-over-year. This increased investment is reflective of both new projects as well as those advancing in our pipeline.\nZoetis is the leader in animal health because of the disruptive innovation, novel products and life cycle enhancements we bring to the market. This increase in R&D expenses reflects our commitment to ensuring our capital allocation prioritizes innovation.\nAdjusted interest and other income reductions are expected to be approximately $170 million. Our adjusted effective tax rate for 2023 is expected to be in the range of 20% to 21%. Adjusted net income is expected to be in the range of $2.49 billion to $2.54 billion, representing operational growth of 7% to 9%.\nOur guidance once again reflects our value proposition of growing revenue in line with or faster than the market and growing adjusted net income faster than revenue. We expect adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.34 to $5.44 and reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.03 to $5.14.\nWe are anticipating capital expenditures in 2023 to increase to $950 million to $1 billion. We continue to make investments to support our future growth, including manufacturing capacity for monoclonal antibodies as well as oral solid dosage.\nFinally, about Zoetis and the animal health industry remain resilient in the face of economic headwinds. Our 2023 guidance range is reflective of uncertain macroeconomic conditions and the impact of veterinary clinic labor challenges. While guidance represents our expectations for the full year, Q1 revenue is expected to be below the low end of the operational growth rate in our full year guidance due to a variety of reasons.\nFirst, Q1 2022 was a strong comparable quarter as we saw robust growth with limited impact from vet clinic labor constraints as well as minimal disruption from our diagnostics field force model change, which began in Q2. Additionally, in the quarter, we expect to see lingering impacts of the latest COVID wave in China.\nLastly, the return of supply on certain products, including Simparica Trio, and subsequent channel restocking as well as promotions to regain share in Q4 2022 modestly increased inventory levels in the channel in the short term.\nIn Q1, we expect a modest decline in adjusted net income versus the prior year as a result of the timing of our 2022 sales force extension in the U.S., which did not start until Q2, as well as the R&D investment noted earlier, which is also off a low base in Q1 2022.\nNow to summarize. 2022 was another strong year despite some challenges, we significantly outperformed the market and continue to take share, all while growing the bottom line faster than the top line. As we begin 2023, we once again expect to grow faster than the market, driven by the strength of our innovative portfolio, our ability to successfully launch new products and expand existing markets and our confidence in the end market dynamics for the spaces we compete in.\nNow I'll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions.

[Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Steve Frank. Steve, you may begin.\n\nSteven Frank\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Zoetis First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. I am joined today by Kristin Peck, our Chief Executive Officer; and Wetteny Joseph, our Chief Financial Officer.\nBefore we begin, I'll remind you that the slides presented on this call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website and that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements and that actual results could differ materially from those projections. For a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer to the forward-looking statements in today's press release and our SEC filings, including, but not limited to our annual report on Form 10-K and our reports on Form 10-Q.\nOur remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures, which were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures is included in the financial tables that accompany our earnings press release and the company's 8-K filing dated today, Thursday, May 2, 2024. We also cite operational results, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange.\nAnd with that, I will turn the call over to Kristin.\n\nKristin C. Peck\n\nExecutive Vice President & Group President, U.S. Operations, Business Development and Strategy, Zoetis, Inc.\n\nThank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter earnings call for 2024. Today, we reported outstanding first quarter results, underscored by steady demand for our products, a focused strategy and our purpose-driven colleagues.\nWe delivered 12% operational revenue growth and grew adjusted net income 15% operationally, in line with the tenet of our value proposition. Driven by the launch of our osteoarthritis pain franchise, the U.S. led the way with 16% growth and 8% operational growth internationally. More specifically, globally, Librela grew 189% operationally, including $40 million in sales in the U.S., in line with our expectations.\nThe powerful human animal bond fueled demand for our companion animal portfolio with 20% growth operationally, while livestock declined 1% operationally. The quarter's results, even amidst global uncertainty, are a testament, once again to the power of our diverse and durable portfolio across markets, species and therapeutic areas. It also highlights the continued rise and resilience of the animal health industry.\nOur purpose and performance are rooted in science, which has way been the great disruptor. And as animal health is increasingly essential for nutrition and companionship, caregivers demand even more high-quality innovation. That means we identify the most prevalent area of unmet veterinary needs and invest in, develop, manufacture and deliver life-changing products that customers have been waiting for.\nTake for example Librela and SOLENSIA, our equal monoclonal antibodies to treat OA pain in dogs and cats, which are helping millions of pets return to play. With more than 18 million doses distributed worldwide, we are providing long-lasting relief animals, many of whom were previously undiagnosed or untreated due to limitations of NSAID.\nWith nearly 40% of all dogs suffering from OA pain globally, we believe just 1/3 of them are being treated. So we're just scratching the surface of care. And cats are visiting the clinic more often. In fact, we're helping current clinic [indiscernible] with Bocat, the first FDA product to alleviate anxiety in cat, which means we're expanding care in a historically under-medicalized area of the market.\nWe understand that social media is a form for convening, a place for pet owners to connect and to share, but we also have responsibility to empower our customers to make informed decisions grounded in science and data. We are unwavering in our commitment rigorous safety and quality standards, which has earned us the trust and confidence of veterinarians worldwide.\nBacked by that commitment, Librela and SOLENSIA are safe and effective. be anchored in 10-year science and have been used in Europe for more than 3 years. In the U.S., 78% of veterinarians, who are at the center of care, are very satisfied with Librela. This is driven by real world experience and consistent with the feedback we hear in other markets. And our research indicates that 46% of vets globally will treat OA earlier and 65% will treat more dogs now that Librela is available.\nTo accurately reaffirm the safety and efficacy of these therapies, we are doubling down, working directly with veterinarians who need these products, hosting live sessions with our Chief Medical Officer and expanding online education screening while deploying capital to expand our DTC strategy. And veterinarians continue to be confident in Librela, as evidenced by a recent blind survey of U.S. vets confirming that perception and intent to prescribe remain unchanged.\nWe remain confident that OA pain could be our next $1 billion franchise because we are meeting the needs of an underserved market. We are growing by nearly every metric, including adoption, penetration, reorder rates, patient share and expanded utilization. And looking at our 4-week rolling over U.S., we're excited to report that sales steadily increased through April.\nOur performance speaks to the power of the human animal bond, discerning pet owners want option, and they will work with their vets to find relief for their best friends. Beyond OA pain, Zoetis has been able to lead the market in other key categories because we deeply understand our customers' needs. This allows us to not only compete in existing markets, but again to create entirely new ones.\nAnd science has created something completely unique to our industry, $2 billion franchises. Our parasiticide portfolio expanded the total market based on deep customer insights. Before Simparica and Simparica Trio, we were #5 in this category. These innovations changed how we compete.\nToday, we are #2, continue gaining share and growing the market even in the face of competition. Similarly, we were first to recognize that new therapies were needed to treat canine itch safely and effectively. That market foresight changed the treatment paradigm and revolutionized type. A decade of dermatology has led to 3 products, 20 major life cycle enhancements, including Cytopoint, the first ever animal health monoclonal antibody and the first chewable with APOQUEl Chew.\nFrom what was 1 believed to be just a $100 million market had grown to $1.4 billion because we know what our customer needs. Today, more than 18 million dogs are treated for allergic itch and atopic dermatitis, and another 13 million remain untreated globally. We built a $1 billion franchise and demonstrated the durability of our portfolio, and we will continue growing this franchise underpinned by strong brand equity, first-mover advantage, life cycle innovation and strong customer relationships.\nWe've led in parasiticide, dermatology and now OA pain. And each time our innovation for these new categories in animal health, you've seen the total industry opportunity expand.\nNow moving to livestock. I'm sure you all saw the news this week on the announcement of our agreement with Phibro Animal Health to sell our global medicated feed additives and certain water-soluble product portfolios and related assets for $350 million. This deal is another great example of Zoetis' disciplined capital allocation strategy to focus investments in areas with the greatest growth potential and innovation that are aligned with our key capabilities.\nI'm confident that under Phibro's management, the global reach of these products will continue to expand to meet customer needs worldwide. We remain very committed to livestock and just sharpening our focus and our core innovative livestock growth areas, including preventative antibiotic alternatives and genetics.\nIn summary, for more than 70 years, Zoetis has been leading the industry with our commitment to innovation. We've invested over $5 billion in R&D since our IPO, which has brought more than 300 product lines to the market. Science is and always has been the great disruptor and at the core of our success in delivering the innovations with veterinarians, livestock producers and pet owners expect from us.\nOur pursuit of science has led to breakthroughs in dermatology, like Cytopoint and chew in parasiticides is Simparica Chew and now the latest OA pain with Librela and SOLENSIA, that are revolutionizing animal health. Blazing new trails isn't easy, but time and time again, our purpose-driven colleagues have proven their ability to expand our industry leadership and board in highly new markets, and we remain committed to delivering strong growth through our anti franchises and diverse portfolio, while continuing to invest for the future.\nLooking ahead to the remainder of 2024, our increased operational guidance reflects the resilience of the animal health market and the execution of our strategic rarity. We continue to be disciplined yet adaptable and our approach to the opportunities, challenges and economic shifts that occur throughout the year. And with that, I will turn it over to Wetteny.\n\nWetteny N. Joseph\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Catalent, Inc.\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. As Kristin mentioned, we had an outstanding start to the year driven by the underlying strength of our companion animal portfolio, particularly our innovative products as well as price growth across all species.\nIn the first quarter, we generated revenue of $2.2 billion, growing 10% on a reported basis and 12% on an operational basis. Adjusted net income of $634 million grew 4% on a reported basis and 15% on an operational basis. Our 12% operational revenue growth was due to the underlying strength of our companion animal portfolio, aided by the impact of a weak comparative quarter in our U.S. companion animal business.\nHowever, the majority of this ability to growth was offset by headwinds related to economic conditions in China the impact of a tough comparative quarter in livestock due to the timing of supply for certain products last year and inventory destocking related to our U.S. diagnostics sales model change.\nOf the 12% operational revenue growth, 7% is from price with 5% growth in volume. While we saw price growth across our portfolio, which was favorably impacted by hyperinflationary markets, especially Argentina, which contributed 2% to our overall price growth. The volume growth was driven primarily by new products, including our monoclonal antibodies for OA pain, Librela and Talentia as well as our key dermatology products and Simparica Trio.\nOn a segment basis, the U.S. posted $1.2 billion in revenue, growing 16% on the quarter, while our International segment reported revenue of $1 billion with operational growth of 8% on the quarter. Our companion animal portfolio was a [indiscernible] revenue growth in Q1, growing 20% operationally. This growth was partially offset by livestock, which declined 1% on an operational basis.\nWe saw double just operational companion animal growth in both the U.S. and our international segments again this quarter, driven by the strong performance of our innovative products, contributions from both volume and price.\nSimparica Trio was the primary driver of growth in the quarter, generating $243 million globally, representing operational growth of 61%. We saw strong demand for Trio as well as continued growth in patient share even with competition. Our OA pain mAbs were also a significant contributor to growth, posting $131 million in the quarter. Global growth came from the impact of new launch markets, both in the U.S. and internationally.\nIn our early launch EU markets, recent vet surveys showed an increase in [indiscernible] therapy and expansion into more moderate OA cases. Our key dermatology products grew 25% operationally in the quarter with $360 million in global revenue. Growth within dermatology was driven primarily by APOQUEL franchise, where we are seeing solid conversion to APOQUEL Chewable, including a modest impact from initial distributor stocking in the U.S. Cytopoint growth continues to be driven by vet and pet owner preference for injectable methods of treatment.\nOur global companion animal diagnostics portfolio declined 12% operationally, with declines in the U.S. driven by distribution model change. These declines were anticipated as our distribution partners sold off their remaining inventory due to our transition to a direct-only model for our U.S. diagnostics portfolio. U.S. declines were partially offset by growth internationally.\nOur lifestyle portfolio declined 1% operationally, as expected, driven by a tough comparative quarter in the prior year, especially in the U.S. as well as impacts from the ongoing economic conditions in China. This decline was partially offset by price growth in our other international markets. Now moving on to revenue growth by segment for the quarter.\nU.S. revenue was $1.2 billion in the quarter, growing 16% with companion animal growth of 25% and livestock posting a 7% decline. The companion animal performance in the quarter was driven by Simparica Trio, our key dermatology portfolio, and the impact of the launch of Librela in the U.S. as well as the impact of a weak comparative quarter.\nOur outstanding companion animal growth came in the quarter where we saw vet clinic visits decrease 1.5%. We continue to see growth in the therapeutic visits, while wellness visits drove the decline. Outgrowth in the retail delivery continued to outpace vet clinics fulfillment, which is based on growing pet owner preference for these alternative channels. This dynamic is expected to put continued pressure on total vet clinic visits without impacting our expectations for revenue.\nDespite the visit decline, revenue and spend per visit in the clinic grew 4.5% and 6%, respectively, which reflects continued pet owner willingness to pay. Turning to product performance.\nSimparica Trio posted sales of $205 million in the quarter, growing 6%. We continue to be the market leader in the triple combination parasiticide space. Our leading footprint across channels has allowed us to continue to drive dosage growth through increased compliance even with declines in wellness visits at the clinic. In addition to a weak comparable period in the prior year, we have seen favorable price realization due to more targeted discount programs to vets as well as channel dynamics.\nDermatology product sales in the U.S. were $233 million for the quarter, growing 27%. We saw growth in both price and volume and across both APOQUEL and Cytopoint. Growth also benefited from a weak comparable period in the prior year. Market demand for dermatology products remains high.\nIn the quarter, we saw growth in both our patient share as well as higher periodic visits in the clinic. Additionally, growth of retail outship programs continue to bolster compliance. At the beginning of April, we made APOQUEL Chewable available through our distribution partners. Our pain maps, Librela and SOLENSIA, posted a combined $57 million in U.S. sales in Q1. Librela generated $40 million in the quarter with underlying vet demand continuing to build on the momentum from our full launch in Q4 of last year. Excluding the impact of the initial clinic stocking, which we were provided last quarter, we are seeing robust sequential quarter growth in Librela, in line with expectations.\nWe continue to see good growth in penetration as well as strong reorder rates, which are approaching 80%, all of which points to positive real-world satisfaction in the clinic and among pet owners. We remain confident, not just in the safety and efficacy of Librela, but also in our expected performance.\nAs Kristin alluded to, we have seen steady increasing trends in our trailing 4-week sales average in the U.S. even into April after the increased media attention. We continue to see steady progress in SOLENSIA, which had U.S. sales of $17 million in the quarter, more than doubling our prior year [indiscernible] sales. We have indicated the feline market needs significant development, but we are pleased with our progress thus far. SOLENSIA is now the market-leading product for feline OA pain in the U.S., and we have seen a significant increase in the medicalized patient pool since launch.\nOur U.S. Companion Animal Diagnostics portfolio declined 21% in the quarter, driven primarily by distributor inventory work-downs following our channel strategy change. This is in line with our expectations and has negligible impact on underlying claim demand.\nU.S. flag [indiscernible] declined 7% in the quarter, while our underlying business performance in the quarter was as expected. Our results are reflective of a strong comparative period in Q1 of 2023, in which we grew 15% due to the return of supply on several products, primarily in cattle.\nSales of swine product due to decreased sales of vaccines as well as Jackson. In poultry, we saw declines as a result of increased generic competition in our medicated feed additive products.\nMoving on to National segment, where revenue grew 3% on a reported basis and 8% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Companion animal grew 14% operationally and livestock grew 2% operationally. Increased sales of our international competitor products were driven by OA pain mabs, key dermatology products, vaccines and small animal parasiticides. This growth was partially offset by impacts in China.\nOur international OA pain mabs grew 67% operationally to $74 million in combined revenue in the quarter. International Librela sales were $59 million, growing 71% operationally. Growth is balanced across new launch markets and our first EU markets. We continue to see evolution in the European markets, where you have seen expansion in Librela's use in moderate cases, which the latest vet surveys now represents the majority of the Librela patients in Europe. We remain pleased with the success of our DTC advertising campaigns in increasing pet owner awareness of OA.\n[indiscernible] sales were $15 million internationally in the quarter, growing 54% on an operational basis. Our international key dermatology portfolio grew 23% operationally in the quarter, posting $127 million in sales. We saw double-digit operational growth across most of our major markets, driven by [indiscernible] and new patients. Wealth was also favorably impacted by preprice increased buy-ups in Japan and certain European markets.\nOur international small animal parasiticides portfolio grew 6% operationally driven by our Simparica franchise, with Simparica Trio, growing 58% operationally to $38 million in sales. Chewy growth benefited from continued uptake in Europe driven by key account penetration and salesforce effectiveness as well as contributions from Trio's launch in China.\nSimparica posted $56 million in revenue, growing 22% on an operational basis in the quarter. This growth was partially offset by a 29% operational decline in our Revolution franchise, which generates a high proportion of sales in China. International livestock grew 2% operationally in the quarter driven by price increases as in high inflationary markets. Price growth was partially offset by volume declines across all of our species, partially driven by a tough comparative period in the prior year due to the return of supply of certain lifestyle products.\nThe volume declines in livestock were driven by cattle due to a tough comparable period related [indiscernible] and worsening market conditions in Australia. Our international swine portfolio saw volume declines driven by China, where we saw lower hog prices as well as a reduction in herd sizes.\nIn sheep, we saw declines from herd reductions due to expected weather conditions in Australia and New Zealand as well as supply constraints on AK products. As we mentioned last quarter, we continue to see economic challenges in China, where low consumer spending and higher urban unemployment have reduced spending. We are also seeing a slowdown in livestock with lower pork prices and smaller herd sizes. The impact on our growth is expected to moderate late in the year, but we expect to continue to see headwinds throughout the year across both companion animal and livestock.\nNow moving on to the rest of the P&L for the quarter. Adjusted gross margins of 70.7% declined 10 basis points on a reported basis compared to the prior year. Foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact of 180 basis points on our reported adjusted margins. Excluding FX, we saw higher margins due to price increases, favorable mix and lower freight costs, partially offset by higher manufacturing costs, especially in hyperinflationary markets.\nAdjusted operating expenses increased 11% operationally, driven primarily by SG&A growth of 10% operationally, mainly due to higher compensation-related expenses as well as increased advertising and promotion spend on our OA pain maps. R&D grew 13% on an operational basis, driven by higher project spend related to both recent acquisitions as well as advancements of our pipeline candidates.\nThe adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 19.7%, a decrease of 80 basis points, primarily due to a higher benefit in the U.S. related to foreign-derived intangible income and a more favorable jurisdictional mix of earnings.\nAnd finally, adjusted net income grew 15% operationally despite a $31 million headwind to growth from the nonrecurring benefit of our prior year royalty settlement. Adjusted diluted EPS grew 17% operationally for the quarter. Capital expenditures in the first quarter were $140 million. In the quarter, we repurchased $339 million of Zoetis shares.\nBefore moving to guidance, I wanted to comment on our recent announcement to divest our medicated food additive portfolio and certain water soluble products to Fibro Animal Health. This is a transaction that demonstrates Zoetis' disciplined capital allocation strategy to focus our investments on innovative solutions that advance animal health, productivity and sustainability. This divestiture will allow us to remain focused on other livestock solutions, including vaccine, biologic and generic programs that are more aligned with our strategic priorities.\nNow moving on to guidance for full year 2024. As we have mentioned, we had an outstanding first quarter that highlighted our ability to deliver through multiple sources of growth. Our performance in companion animal, especially in parasiticides and our key dermatology franchises exceeded our expectations. Additionally, we continue to be pleased with the progress of the U.S. launch of Librela and are confident in our ability to meet expectations.\nWe are, therefore, raising our 2024 operational guidance provided during February's earnings call. Note that guidance reflects foreign exchange rates as of late April. The updated foreign exchange rates negatively impacted our reported revenue guidance by approximately 2% and our reported adjusted net income guidance by approximately 4% when compared to our initial guidance issued in February.\nFor the year, we expect revenue between $9.05 billion and $9.20 billion, representing a range of 8.5% to 10.5% operational growth. Our increase in operational growth is reflective of Argentina's pricing impact as well as due to performance in our companion animal parasiticides and key dermatology products. We now expect our full year operational growth for Simparica Trio to be double digits, while we expect growth in our key dermatology products to be in the high single-digit range.\nAs we stated earlier, we remain pleased with our U.S. launch of Librela. Our expectations for Librela for the year remain unchanged. Moving down the P&L. we now expect adjusted net income to be in the range of $2.62 billion to $2.67 billion, representing operational growth of 13% to 15%. And finally, we expect adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.71 to $5.81 and reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.34 to $5.44.\nJust to summarize before we go to Q&A, we are very pleased with our start to the year. While our reported results are reflective of various foreign exchange-related headwinds, operationally, we continue to deliver growth across our key therapeutic areas and across most of our major markets. This growth highlights the diversity and dependability that allows us to continually outpace the animal health market. Additionally, we continue to lead the way, creating new markets and launching new innovation that increases the standard of medical care for animals.\nNow I'll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions.

Hosting the call today is Steve Frank, Vice President of Investor Relations for Zoetis. The presentation materials and additional financial tables are currently posted on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. The presentation slides can be managed by you, the viewer, and will not be forwarded automatically. In addition, a replay of this call will be available approximately 2 hours after the conclusion of this call via dial-in or on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com.\n(Operator Instructions) It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Steve Frank. Steve, you may begin.\n\nSteven Frank\n\nVP of IR, Zoetis Inc.\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Zoetis Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. I am joined today by Kristin Peck, our Chief Executive Officer; and Wetteny Joseph, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'll remind you that the slides presented on this call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website and that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements and that actual results could differ materially from those projections.\nFor a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statements in today's press release and our SEC filings, including, but not limited to our annual report on Form 10-K and our reports on Form 10-Q.\nOur remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures, which were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or U.S. GAAP, a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures is included in the financial tables that accompany our earnings press release and the company's 8-K filing dated today, Thursday, November 3, 2022. We also cite operational results, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Kristin.\n\nKristin C. Peck\n\nCEO & Director, Zoetis Inc.\n\nThank you, Steve, and welcome, everyone, to our third quarter earnings call for 2022. While the world faces a dynamic external environment and uncertainty in the global economy, our business has been tested and continues to perform well based on our diverse durable portfolio and global footprint. In the third quarter, we delivered solid results with 5% operational revenue growth, reflecting steady performance across our innovation-driven companion animal portfolio especially in our international markets.\nOur international business grew 8% operationally and the U.S. grew 2% in the quarter. As we've been saying for some time, supply challenges throughout the year remain a headwind to meeting global demand, and those impacts were more pronounced in the third quarter. Supply has been improving in certain product categories such as parasiticides, and we continue prioritizing supply for key products and markets. However, we do expect constraints in some categories to continue.\nOverall, positive pet care trends in terms of increasing spend and pet owner demographics continue to underpin the strength of our business. With 10% operational growth in companion animal products in the third quarter, we continue to see strong demand globally for Simparica Trio and other parasiticides, our key dermatology products, Apoquel and Cytopoint, small animal vaccine and monoclonal antibodies, Librela and Solensia.\nIn the U.S., supply constraints for companion animal products tempered some of our expected growth in the quarter, and we also experienced an impact related to workforce challenges in veterinary clinics. The decline in clinic visits is stabilizing at pre-COVID rates as clinics struggle with capacity issues. That being said, average revenues per visit continue to rise in the U.S. as pet owners plays a premium on the care of their pets, a positive long-term trend.\nThis commitment to pet well-being is also demonstrated in the success of our monoclonal antibodies for osteoarthritis pain, Librela and Solensia. They are performing exceptionally well in the EU and Solensia is on track after being launched in the U.S. at the end of the third quarter. We are investing in building a fee line market for pain treatment and undertreated condition for cats.\nOutside of the U.S. companion animal products showed strong growth of 17% operationally. In some of our largest markets like China and Australia, we're seeing our innovative pet care products contributing more and more to growth in these traditionally live stock-driven markets. Meanwhile, our global livestock business performed largely as expected in the third quarter, with a decline of 3% operationally. We continue to face generic competition for livestock products, especially in cattle and poultry, and we face supply constraints in products such as vaccines.\nHowever, we are seeing solid pockets of growth, especially in aquaculture and poultry products and certain markets outside the U.S. As we stabilize from the generic competition, and review more consistent supply, we will improve our livestock performance. Looking ahead, we remain confident in the innovation-driven strength of our business especially in areas such as parasiticides, key dermatology products, vaccines and monoclonal antibodies. I am optimistic about the fundamental growth drivers and essential nature of the animal health industry to weather challenging times. However, we are revising our full year guidance to affect lower-than-expected sales in the second half of the year due to supply constraints, veterinary workforce challenges and recent changes to foreign exchange rates. We believe it is prudent to take a more cautious view given the increasing uncertainty around supply, inflation and other macroeconomic conditions that have become less predictable. As we look ahead, to our tenth anniversary as an independent company next year and I reflect on all that we've achieved in the last decade. I feel very positive about where we are and the capabilities we have to overcome any challenges we face.\nHistorically, we've always been able to adapt our business to meet evolving customer needs, drive growth faster than the market and achieve our purpose in nurturing the world and human kind by advancing care for animals. The human animal bond and people's connection to pets and farm animals is powerful. It's a bond we support with a diverse portfolio that remains the strength of our business, and we see strong global demand for innovative products, especially in companion animal parasiticides, dermatology, vaccines, diagnostics and monoclonal antibodies for pain. Positive pet owner demographics and their willingness to spend on the care of their animals remain long-term sustainable drivers of growth despite some of the workforce challenges in clinics and livestock continues to be an important part of our business, an area where we drive significant value for our customers and shareholders.\nTo sustain our growth, innovation remains our lifeblood, and we continue investing in the industry's leading R&D engine at Zoetis. Our monoclonal antibody portfolio for OA pain is a game changer. It has been performing exceptionally well as a pet treatment and growth driver in an increasing number of markets, and Librela is expected to be a blockbuster for Zoetis in 2022.\nIn terms of the U.S. approval for Librela, we have confirmed dates for the FDA site inspections outside the U.S., but their timing makes it unlikely to have an approval this year. Given our ongoing conversations with the FDA, we are confident in receiving approval in the first half of 2023 with a launch planned for late in the year.\nIn closing, our business continues to perform well in a dynamic market and we are well positioned to advance our strategic growth opportunities in parasiticides, dermatology, pain, diagnostics and emerging markets. Even as we face challenging supply constraints, generic competition and macroeconomic uncertainty, I remain confident in the resilience of our business and colleagues as we finish 2022 and we go into 2023. Given the importance of the companionship and nutrition provided by pets and farm minimals and the power of the human animal bond, the animal health industry has consistently grown in the mid-single digits even in down markets. And as the leader in animal health, we have the pipeline, market leadership positions, global scale and financial strength to continue outpacing the market. Throughout the last 10 years in various market conditions, we have grown the top line an average of about 8%. And even in the last recession, when our business was more livestock than companion animal, we still grew.\nAs we look toward the end of the year and into 2023, I expect us to continue setting the bar on innovation, cultivating a high-performing culture and delivering superior customer experiences. All of this will have us growing significantly above the market and building enduring value for shareholders in this dynamic market. Thank you.\nNow let me hand things over to Wetteny.\n\nWetteny N. Joseph\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Zoetis Inc.\n\nThank you, Kristin, and good morning, everyone. As Kristin mentioned, we had a solid quarter with growth across a number of our core franchises, driven by our companion animal performance, especially in international. Today, I will focus my comments on our third quarter financial results. The key drivers contributing to our performance and provide an update on our full year 2022 guidance.\nIn the third quarter, we generated revenue of $2 billion, growing 1% on a reported basis and 5% on an operational basis. Adjusted net income of $566 million declined 5% on a reported basis and grew 2% on an operational basis. Of the 5% operational revenue growth, 4% is from volume and 1% from price. Volume growth consisted of 4% from new products, which includes Simparica Trio and monoclonal antibodies, for osteoarthritis pain in dogs and cats, Librela an Solensia and 1% from key dermatology products, while other in-line products declined 1%. The decline was largely the result of supply challenges. Companion animal products continue to be the primary driver of growth, growing 10% operationally, with livestock declining 3% on an operational basis in the quarter.\nSimparica Trio was the largest contributor to growth in the quarter. Trio posted global revenue of $172 million, representing operational growth of 43% versus the comparable period in 2021. We expect to continue to grow the addressable market for flea, tick and heartworm globally and see significant room for growth with brands like Simparica Trio, Simparica, ProHeart and Revolution Plus.\nMeanwhile, our key dermatology products, Apoquel and Cytopoint, had solid global growth, especially internationally, with $343 million of revenue, representing 11% operational growth against a robust prior year in which these products grew 26% operationally. Year-to-date revenue is $966 million, representing 18% operational growth. Sales of our monoclonal antibodies for osteoarthritis pain in dogs and cats in International continue to exceed expectations posting $37 million of sales in the quarter.\nSwitching to Diagnostics. Our global companion animal diagnostics portfolio recorded $78 million in revenue in Q3, declining 9% operationally. Despite declining revenues, we saw solid new instrument placements in the quarter. The decline in our U.S. diagnostics portfolio was partially offset by growth internationally into the quarter. In the U.S., our diagnostics results were also impacted by the vet clinic workforce challenges, and we continue to experience a slowdown in sales as we transition to our new go-to-market model and build out a sizable and new dedicated field force for diagnostics. While disruptive in the short term, this investment is putting the necessary elements in place to position and grow our diagnostics portfolio over the long run.\nWe expect the effectiveness of our new diagnosis field force to improve gradually into 2023. Diagnostics remains core to our business and a key long-term growth driver for Zoetis. Meanwhile, sales of livestock products declined by 3% operationally in the quarter. Our portfolio continues to be challenged by generics and cheaper alternatives to DRAXXIN in cattle as well as Zoamix in poultry and supply challenges for certain products.\nOur fish portfolio grew 19% operationally in the quarter and along with the strength of our sheep products in Australia, partially offset the broader decline.\nNow moving on to revenue growth by segment for the quarter. U.S. revenue was $1.1 billion in the quarter, growing 2% with companion animal sales growing 6% and livestock sales declining by 7%. Focusing first on companion animal. The effects of our ongoing supply challenges were more pronounced in the third quarter, tempering growth in our parasiticides. In U.S. companion animal, we are also seeing vet clinic workforce challenges limiting appointment availability as visits declined 4% in the quarter.\nDespite lower visits, parasiticide revenue is growing approximately 5% and as spending per visit remained strong again this quarter, increasing more than 9%. The decline in clinic visits is stabilizing at pre-COVID levels as the impact of higher pet ownership growth rates due to COVID normalize and vet practices deal with workforce challenges. However, underlying demand for veterinary care remains robust throughout the country, even as people return to work. While vet clinic workforce challenges do exist, we believe vet clinic revenue will continue to grow at levels above what we were seeing prior to COVID as the standard of veterinary care continues to increase through innovation, better pet ownership demographics, higher compliance and more pets.\nEven with the robust comparative year, we continue to see volume growth in our companion animal products, driven by our innovative products, such as Trio and our key dermatology products, Apoquel and Cytopoint. Growth of Simparica Trio was again strong in the quarter with sales of [$157 million] in the U.S., growing 43%. Despite the impact of supply constraints and the vet clinic workforce challenges, we continue to take share within individual clinics. These dynamics will provide additional runway for future expansion of both the broader market and revenue growth for Trio.\nKey dermatology products sales in the U.S. were $231 million for the quarter, growing 6% with Apoquel and Cytopoint each contributing to growth. Year-to-date, our U.S. derm portfolio has grown 12%. Growth is tempered by prior year COVID related spikes in derm visits that drove visit growth of 25% in Q3 2021 and help accelerate market expansion. This growth was also impacted by the ongoing pet clinic workforce challenges. We expect continued expansion of the market for the foreseeable future.\nU.S. livestock declined 7% in the quarter as expected, with sold of cattle products impacted by generic competition for DRAXXIN. Meanwhile, our U.S. poultry portfolio continues to be negatively impacted by the expanded use of lower cost alternatives and generic competition for Zoamix. U.S. swine product sales declined 3% in the quarter, driven primarily by increased competition for vaccines. Moving on to our International segment, where revenue declined 2% on a reported basis and grew 8% operationally in the quarter. International companion animal revenue grew 17% operationally and livestock revenue was flat operationally.\nIncreased sales of companion animal products resulted from growth of monoclonal antibodies for elevation of osteoarthritis pain, our key dermatology products, and Simparica Trio. We remain excited with the long-term prospects of these innovative brands and expect future direct-to-consumer advertising to help drive additional growth. Sales of companion animal vaccines also contributed to growth in the quarter. We continue to be pleased with the performance of our monoclonal antibodies for OA pain with Librela generating $31 million and Solensia delivering $6 million in third quarter sales.\nLibrela remains on track to exceed $100 million in revenue this year, a new blockbuster for Zoetis. As we have mentioned in prior quarters, Librela is the #1 pain product in the EU with the underlying performance metrics being very favorable for future growth. Reordering rates remain high. Compliance continues to exceed our initial expectations and we continue to see significant opportunity to expand the pain market with a meaningful percentage of dogs on Librela being new to the market. We saw volume growth in our international companion animal portfolio in the third quarter and we also saw growth across our injectable products, including monoclonal antibodies and vaccines.\nMeanwhile, international livestock was flat operationally in the quarter. Our fish portfolio grew 19% operationally and experienced increased demand for vaccines in key salmon markets, including Norway and Chile. Sales of ship products grew as a result of favorable market conditions and new product launches in Australia. Growth was offset by swine sales, which declined due to supply constraints across international and lower sales across Europe due to reduced exports to China and higher input costs for producers.\nSales in Brazil also declined as we are seeing supply challenges on cattle products. Additionally, inflationary impacts on consumer spending are driving consumption away from beef to lower-cost animal proteins such as pork and chicken and reducing reducer profitability. Lastly, the Jurox acquisition, which is based in Australia, was completed on September 30 and is not reflected in our Q3 results.\nNow moving on to the rest of the P&L for the quarter. Adjusted gross margins of 69.8% decreased 90 basis points on a comparable basis to the prior year, resulting primarily from unfavorable foreign exchange impacts. Operationally, gross margin slightly declined driven by higher manufacturing, freight and other costs, which were largely offset by favorable mix and price. Adjusted operating expenses increased 3% operationally with SG&A growth of 3% operationally, driven by T&E costs beginning to return to pre-COVID levels as well as freight and logistics. R&D expenses increased 4% operationally due to higher compensation costs and higher operating costs.\nThe adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 20.9%, an increase of 420 basis points due to unfavorable changes to the jurisdictional mix of earnings, including decreased favorability related to foreign-derived intangible income in the prior year period. And finally, adjusted net income grew 2% operationally and adjusted diluted EPS grew 4% operationally for the quarter. Capital expenditures in the third quarter were $154 million. In the quarter, we repurchased approximately $375 million vet shares and returned over $0.5 billion to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends.\nYear-to-date, we have repurchased almost $1.2 billion of Zoetis shares.\nNow moving on to our updated guidance for the full year 2022. For operational revenue growth, we are lowering our growth to 7% to 8%, previously 9.5% to 10.5%. We are also lowering our operational growth expectations for adjusted net income to a range of 9% to 11%, previously 11% to 13%. This change in guidance is reflective of our Q3 results continued to impact from supply challenges and the ongoing vet clinic workforce challenges.\nForeign exchange rates on our updated guidance are as of late October and reflect the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Beginning with revenue for the full year 2022 due to lowering of our guidance and the impact of foreign exchange, we are now projecting revenue of between $8.0 billion and $8.075 billion. We lowered our operating expense guidance for the full year, reflecting lower expenses in both Q3 and Q4, which reflects our ability to manage costs. Additionally, it is worth noting that our expected Q4 expense decline is also impacted by an easier comp due to heavy spending in the fourth quarter last year.\nAdditionally, our guidance for adjusted interest expense and OID was changed to reflect favorable changes to interest income. We now expect adjusted net income to be in the range of $2.27 billion to $2.31 billion. And finally, we expect adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $4.83 to $4.90 and reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $4.51 to $4.59. While lower -- our full year 2022 guidance once again reflects our value proposition of growing revenue in line with or faster than the market and growing adjusted net income faster than revenue over the long term.\nOur success will continue to come from our diversified portfolio of enduring brands driven by multiple sources of in-line growth, productive innovation and our infrastructure to develop and expand market globally. We expect to continue to execute across multiple dimensions of our business and capitalize on key growth opportunities for the foreseeable future.\nNow I'll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions.
