Welcome to the 3M Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded Friday, July 26, 2024.\nI would now like to turn the call over to Bruce Jermeland, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations at 3M.\n\nBruce Jermeland\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter earnings conference call. With me today are Bill Brown, 3M's Chief Executive Officer; and Monish Patolawala, our President and Chief Financial Officer. Bill and Monish will make some formal comments, then we'll take your questions. Please note that today's earnings release and slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on the homepage of our Investor Relations website at 3m.com.\nPlease turn to Slide 2. Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement. During today's conference call, we'll be making certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M's future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-Q list some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions.\nPlease note throughout today's presentation, we will be making references to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures can be found in the attachments to today's press release.\nWith that, please turn to Slide 3, and I'll hand the call off to Bill. Bill?\n\nWilliam M. Brown\n\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Harris Corp.\n\nOkay. Thank you, Bruce, and good morning, everyone. This morning, we reported second quarter results with non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.93, up nearly 40% with 1% organic revenue growth. Adjusted free cash flow was $1.2 billion with conversion of 109%. I'd like to thank the 3M employees for all their hard work in delivering solid second quarter results. Monish will provide further details on the quarter, and then I'll wrap up our prepared remarks with guidance for the year before opening the call to Q&A.\nI've now been in the job for nearly 3 months, and I have been busy visiting a number of our factories and labs as well as taking a fresh look at our strategy and how we're executing against it. As you know, 3M has been undergoing a lot of change in the past few years following COVID. most recently with the successful spin-off of the health care business, executing on a significant restructuring effort and working to mitigate risks, including discontinuing PFAS manufacturing by the end of 2025 and settling legal matters.\nYou've also seen a number of changes to our organizational model, shifting from a geographic to a global business unit structure and centralizing our global supply chain activities under one senior leader. Collectively, this has been a massive transformational change for 3M, and the team has executed really well. As a result of these efforts, you're seeing the benefits in operating margin expansion, strong cash generation and a solid balance sheet with low leverage ratios and an incrementally more positive view from the rating agencies.\nCredit to Mike and Monish for the steady hand in guiding the company through these changes. But my job is to look forward. And while much progress has been made, we have more to do including navigating PFAS-related matters, where fortunately, we have a strong terrific team managing the exit in our ongoing legal matters. As I see it, we're still in the early innings of our operational excellence journey, and we haven't yet cracked the code on organic growth, which I know is essential to creating shareholder value. So my top priorities are, number one, driving sustained top line organic growth; number two, improving operational performance across the enterprise; and number three, effectively deploying capital.\nOn the first priority, I believe that the company has significant organic growth opportunities as we participate in end markets with favorable secular trends and have a strong foundation and long history in material science innovation. However, as you well know, organic growth has been below market indices and peers over several years and up only about 1% year-to-date. Driving sustained organic growth requires both getting more out of R&D as well as improving commercial excellence. As I've gotten into the details, what I've learned is that ex Solventum R&D investment for core 3M, which is running about $1 billion per year or about 4.5% of revenue, has been flat nominally over the past 5 years and down on a real basis, as the focus was on investing in and strengthening the health care business.\nAnd within the lower spend, the amount we invest on new product development has declined even further as the company shifted more dollars to efforts to exit PFAS manufacturing and work to reduce supply chain cost and resolve COVID-related sourcing constraints. As a result of the decline in investment, along with a strategic shift to fewer but larger innovation opportunities, the number of in revenue from new product introductions has steadily declined over the past decade. The simple fact is that our products are aging.\nWhile we've been shifting our portfolio towards higher-growth markets like auto electrification, industrial automation, data centers and semis, climate tech and others. These efforts aren't material enough today to offset erosion in our core. They remain, for the most part, attractive growth platforms and we need to continue to balance investing appropriately in markets that are evolving quickly while also investing incrementally to sustain the core products we have today.\nBut before we make any adjustments to our R&D budget, I want to first explore opportunities to get more from what we currently spend. For example, improving the velocity of our new product development process, and increasing the effective capacity of our engineers by eliminating bottlenecks and non-value-added work. And over time, redeploying those currently working on PFAS-exit activities to growth initiatives. With enhanced data transparency and a more coordinated governance process, we can improve R&D effectiveness by deploying resources on the highest return projects. These efforts are essential to reinvigorating the 3M innovation machine, but will take time to bear fruit.\nSo in the near term, we have to focus on commercial excellence to sell more of what we currently offer and that means better sales force and distributor effectiveness, targeted marketing, optimized pricing and much better execution at the customer interface, in particular, on time in full performance which is a key part of my second priority, operational performance.\nWe have a terrific ops leadership team in place executing on a number of opportunities, and I want to give you some color of what I'm seeing so far. I've been looking at our manufacturing and distribution network to understand our global supply chain and distribution capabilities. I see opportunity to reduce complexity, drive lean manufacturing and logistics, improve supply chain management, lower yield loss and increased service levels with lower inventory. While our network of 110 factories and 95 distribution centers have historically served 3M well, it is incredibly complex and interconnected with most SKUs we produce touching multiple factories before reaching the customer.\nFor example, a command strip touches 5 factories and 2 distribution points before it hits the store shelf. This extends cycle times increases goods in transit and drives up logistics and freight costs. In lean manufacturing and logistics, we're developing a consistent metric around operating equipment efficiency, or OEE, to increase equipment utilization and rein in capital spending and mapping modes and flows to lower freight and distribution costs. In supply chain, we have significant opportunities to improve our sourcing effectiveness. We have more than 25,000 direct and indirect suppliers, including nearly 4,000 contract and component manufacturers. Yet more than 80% of our raw materials are sole sourced.\nWe haven't been holding our suppliers accountable to the same quality and delivery standards as our customers hold us to and we're only beginning to leverage our scale to reduce cost. Relative to yield loss, our raw material waste is running close to 5% of cost of goods sold, due in part to how we design and manufacture our products but also due to inefficient production scheduling and changeovers. And finally, we have too much inventory at about $4 billion in [ 102 ] days at the end of Q2. And yet our service levels are only in the mid-80s. Our bottoms-up analysis indicates we should be closer to 75 days of inventory or lower, which would imply about $1 billion cash opportunity over time while we drive on-time in full above 90%.\nMy third priority is effectively deploying capital and our approach remains the same as it's been. Investing in R&D and CapEx to fund organic growth, paying an attractive dividend, which we just recalibrated with the spin of Solventum, maintaining a strong balance sheet, and using excess capital for M&A or share buybacks. We repurchased about $400 million in stock in the second quarter and have the capacity to do more in the second half and next year. While no acquisitions are on the near-term horizon, I'll be taking a fresh dispassionate look at our portfolio to determine if any assets have greater value owned by others. And along the same line, what assets might be a good fit for 3M. I don't have anything further to say on that today, but you can expect to hear more from me regarding portfolio prioritization as I deepen my understanding of our businesses and end markets.\nSo for the past 3 months, it's been pretty busy with a lot still to learn. I think we have a good foundation to build upon and believe that this focus on fundamentals, back to basics approach will drive value creation. I'm encouraging everyone at 3M from top to bottom to every day challenge the status quo and the way we've done things in the past to act with speed and urgency and to off-board those things that distract us from growing innovating and executing for customers and shareholders.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to Monish to cover the quarter, and I'll come back to discuss guidance. Monish?\n\nMonish D. Patolawala\n\nSenior VP & CFO, 3M Company\n\nThank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 4. I would like to take a moment to briefly remind you of a few items that we highlighted during last quarter's earnings call. Beginning with the second quarter, our results for business segment operating income includes prospectively the impact of dis-synergies or stranded costs previously associated with Solventum. Therefore, for historical pre-spin periods presented, the dissynergies are reflected in corporate and unallocated. In addition, we added a new operating category named Other for Solventum transition service agreement activity. Other include a Q1 cost associated with supporting the agreements for which 3M started to be reimbursed for in April. And finally, corporate and unallocated incorporates the commercial agreements between 3M and Solventum that started on April 1 and retrospectively picks up certain operations of the former health care business retained by 3M. Turning to our second quarter performance.\nWe posted solid adjusted results, including sales of $6 billion, operating margins of 21.6%, earnings per share of $1.93 and free cash flow of $1.2 billion. We delivered adjusted organic growth of 1.2% or up 2.4%, excluding geographic prioritization and product portfolio initiatives. These results reflect the trends that we have previously discussed, including strong growth in electronics mixed industrial end markets and continued softness in consumer retail discretionary spending. We had another strong quarter of execution with adjusted operating margins expanding 440 basis points year-on-year and delivered adjusted free cash flow of $1.2 billion with conversion of 109%. Please turn to Slide 5.\nOn an adjusted basis, we delivered operating margins of 21.6%, up 440 basis points and earnings of $1.93 per share, up 39% versus last year's second quarter. Our second quarter year-on-year performance was driven by organic growth, productivity, strong spending discipline and restructuring savings which combined benefited operating margins by 310 basis points and earnings by $0.31 per share. In addition, income from the transition services we are providing to Solventum increased margins by 50 basis points and earnings by $0.05 per share.\nThese benefits were partially offset by stock-based compensation, which was shifted into the second quarter due to the spin of Solventum. This was in line with what we discussed during our first quarter earnings call. This change in timing negatively impacted operating margins by 200 basis points and earnings by $0.18 per share versus last year's second quarter. Lower year-on-year restructuring charges were a benefit of 270 basis points to margins and $0.23 to earnings.\nFor the second quarter, restructuring charges were $44 million, which were lower than anticipated. For the full year, we continue to expect pretax restructuring charges in the range of $250 million to $300 million. Foreign currency was a negative $0.04 per share impact as a result of the stronger U.S. dollar. Acquisitions and divestitures were a benefit of 10 basis points to margins and $0.03 to earnings year-on-year. This benefit is related to last year's second quarter reconsolidation of Aearo Technologies, along with the commercial agreements between 3M and Solventum. Below-the-line items benefited earnings by a combined $0.14 per share. This benefit was primarily due to increased interest income year-on-year on higher cash balance due to in part by cash proceeds received from the spin of Solventum.\nTaking into account our first half of the year performance, we now expect our full year nonoperating expense to be in the range of $50 million to $75 million versus a prior range of $75 million to $100 million. A quick comment on corporate and unallocated and other before moving on to cash flow. Q2 corporate and unallocated sales were $86 million with a $2 million adjusted operating loss. Year-to-date, corporate and unallocated sales were $112 million with an adjusted operating loss of $73 million. This is in line with our full year anticipated sales range of $225 million to $275 million with the forecasted adjusted operating loss in the range of $125 million to $175 million. Our other category had operating income of $37 million, which reflects the level of activity and effort to support the successful spinout of Solventum. Year-to-date, Other had an operating loss of $28 million, which is in line with our full year expectation of flat to a loss of $25 million. Please turn to Slide 6.\nSecond quarter adjusted free cash flow was $1.2 billion. Our second quarter performance was driven by strong operating income lower CapEx spending, partially offset by higher working capital. Adjusted capital expenditures were $250 million in the quarter as we continue to invest in growth, productivity and sustainability. During the quarter, we returned a total of $800 million to shareholders, split equally between dividends and share repurchases. And finally, net debt at the end of Q2 stood at approximately $3 billion.\nThe strong results build on our track record of robust cash generation. For the first half of the year, we have generated $2 billion of adjusted free cash flow. Our strong capital structure continues to provide us the financial flexibility to invest in our business, return capital to shareholders and meet the cash flow needs related to legal matters. Please note that in the month of July, we will make total combined payments of $3.7 billion related to the public water supplies and combat Arm settlements. Before I move on to our business segment performance, I want to highlight a couple of items for your awareness that were excluded in arriving at our Q2 adjusted results.\nFirst, note that we reach settlements of approximately $120 million with insurance carriers related to combat arms. We remain in discussion with multiple carriers and anticipate additional future recoveries. Second, during the quarter, we incurred a noncash charge of approximately $800 million related to a $2.5 billion pension risk transfer on a portion of our U.S. defined pension obligation with Met Tower Life. This action helps us to reduce risk and administrative fees related to our U.S. pension plan. Please turn to Slide 7.\nStarting with our Safety and Industrial business, which posted sales of $2.8 billion, up 1.1% organically. Industrial adhesives and tapes posted mid-single-digit organic growth driven by strength in bonding solutions for consumer electronic devices. Personal safety and automotive aftermarket grew low single digits. Electrical Markets was up slightly while roofing glanules was flat due to unplanned customer manufacturing challenges. And finally, we experienced year-on-year organic sales declines in abrasives and industrial specialties.\nGeographically, industrial markets grew low single digits in the U.S. and Asia Pacific, while EMEA was down low single digits. Overall, industrial end market demand continued to be mixed in the quarter as end user and channel remain cautious. Adjusted operating income was $623 million with adjusted operating margins of 22.6%, up 40 basis points year-on-year. This performance was driven by higher sales volume benefits from ongoing productivity and restructuring actions and [ lower ] year-on-year restructuring charges. These benefits were partially offset by the timing of stock-based compensation and cost inefficiencies due to the spin of Solventum.\nMoving to Transportation and Electronics on Slide 8, which posted adjusted sales of $1.9 billion or up 3.3% organically. Our electronics business outperformed the market, up low double digits organically as we continue to gain spec-in wins on consumer electronic devices and in semiconductor manufacturing. Our auto OEM business increased nearly 5% in Q2 versus a 0.5 point decrease in global car and light truck builds. Looking at the first half of the year, our auto OEM business was up 9% organically versus a flat global build rate of cars and light trucks as we continue to gain penetration on new platforms.\nLooking at the rest of Transportation and Electronics, Advanced Materials grew mid-single digits organically, and commercial branding and transportation was down low single digits year-on-year. Transportation and Electronics delivered $426 million in adjusted operating income, up 16% year-on-year. Adjusted operating margins were 22.3%, up 250 basis points year-on-year. The team achieved this result through strong leverage on electronics volumes, ongoing benefits from productivity and restructuring actions and lower year-on-year restructuring charges. Partially offsetting these benefits were the timing of stock-based compensation grants and cost inefficiencies due to the spin of Solventum. Turning to Slide 9.\nThe Consumer business posted second quarter sales of $1.3 billion. Organic sales declined 1.4% year-on-year with continued softness in consumer discretionary spending. This included a 2.7 percentage point impact from portfolio and geographic prioritization. Home improvement grew mid-single digits. Consumer safety and well-being grew low single digits Packaging and expression declined low single digits, while Home and Auto Care declined mid-single digits organically. Geographically, the U.S. was up slightly. Asia Pacific was down mid-single digits, and EMEA was down high single digits.\nConsumer second quarter operating income was $219 million, down 7% compared to last year with operating margins of 17.4%, down 80 basis points year-on-year. Operating margin performance was driven by lower volume and timing of stock-based compensation grants along with the cost inefficiencies due to the spin of Solventum. Partially offsetting these headwinds were benefits from lower restructuring charges.\nBefore I turn it back over to Bill. I want to take a moment to thank the 3M team for the tremendous progress they have made positioning the company for success. I am very proud of the relentless focus our teams have brought to create value by driving performance through our improved productivity and efficiency, spinning out of our health care business and reducing risk and uncertainty by managing legal matters. I am confident that under Bill's leadership, the team will continue to build on this momentum to create consistent value for our people, our customers and our shareholders in the years to come. I would also like to thank all the analysts and investors for our rich discussions and engagements over the last 4 years.\nWith that, please turn to Slide 10, and I will turn it back over to Bill for an update on our guidance. Bill?\n\nWilliam M. Brown\n\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Harris Corp.\n\nThanks, Monish. Given the strong operational execution in the first half of the year, we're raising the bottom end of our full year adjusted earnings guidance by $0.20 to a range of $7 to $7.30 versus $6.80 to $7.30 previously, now up 16% to 21% year-on-year. Full year adjusted operating margins are now expected to be up 225 to 275 basis points. Full year adjusted organic growth remains unchanged at flat to up 2% and with expectations for second half organic growth in line with first half performance at the midpoint. While significant macro uncertainty remains, our business segment and market trends are largely playing out as expected.\nYear-to-date, Safety and Industrial organic growth is approximately flat versus a full year expectation of flat to up low single digits. We expect that industrial end markets will remain mixed as channel partners and end customers continue to remain cautious on overall demand trends. On an adjusted basis, transportation and electronics is up nearly 5% organically in the first half. versus a full year expectation of up low single digits. Strength in the first half was due in large part to consumer electronics, along with automotive. We continue to monitor auto build rates along with consumer electronics demand trends for the back-to-school and holiday season. And finally, consumer is down nearly 3% organically through the first half of the year versus a full year expectation of down low single digits. We continue to expect that consumer retail discretionary spending on hardline goods to remain muted in the balance of the year.\nBefore we open up to your questions, I would like to take a moment to recognize and thank Monish for all his contributions and impact on 3M over the past 4 years. While I've only had a short time working with him, he's been a strong partner and has helped me get up to speed on the company, and I've enjoyed working with them. I appreciate everything he has done to navigate through a number of challenges and to make 3M stronger along the way.\nWith that, let's open the call to your questions.",

Welcome to the 2024 Second Quarter A. O. Smith Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today, Helen Gurholt. Please go ahead.\n\nHelen E. Gurholt\n\nVP of IR and Financial Planning & Analysis, A. O. Smith Corporation\n\nThank you, Marvin. Good morning, and welcome to the A.O. Smith Second Quarter Conference Call. I'm Helen Gurholt, Vice President, Investor Relations and Financial Planning and Analysis. Joining me today are Kevin Wheeler, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Chuck Lauber, Chief Financial Officer.\nIn order to provide improved transparency into the operating results of our business, we provide non-GAAP measures. Free cash flow is defined as cash from operations plus capital expenditures, adjusted earnings, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted segment earnings and adjusted corporate expenses, exclude the impact of pension settlement income and restructuring and impairment expenses. Reconciliations from GAAP measures to non-GAAP measures are provided in the appendix at the end of this presentation and on our website.\nA friendly reminder that some of our comments and answers during this conference call will be forward-looking statements that are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include matters that we described in this morning's press release, among others. Also, as a courtesy to others in the question queue, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up per turn. If you have multiple questions, please rejoin the queue. We will be using slides as we move through today's call. You can access them on our website at investors.aosmith.com.\nI will now turn the call over to Kevin to begin our prepared remarks.\n\nKevin J. Wheeler\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, A. O. Smith Corp.\n\nThank you, Helen, and good morning, everyone. I'm on Slide 4 and our second quarter results. I'm very pleased with our second quarter performance and how we are tracking for the year. In the second quarter, our global A.O. Smith team delivered record quarterly sales of $1 billion and EPS of $1.06, a 5% increase over 2023 adjusted EPS. North American water heater and boiler sales increased 10% due to higher volumes and pricing action. China third-party sales grew 2% in local currency. India achieved double-digit growth in local currency for the tenth consecutive quarter. And last week, we announced that we signed an agreement to acquire Pureit, a leading water purification business in South Asia. We look forward to welcoming the Pureit team to the A. O. Smith family later this year.\nPlease turn to Slide 5. North America water heater sales grew 10% in the second quarter due to higher residential and commercial volumes and pricing actions. We began shipping our internally developed and manufactured gas tankless products in the quarter, and we are very pleased with market acceptance. Our North America boiler sales grew 10% compared to the second quarter of last year, driven by higher commercial volumes. I am pleased to see a return to growth as channel inventory levels normalize. We are on track to achieve our boiler sales forecast of 8% to 10% for the year.\nSales of our commercial boilers, particularly our CREST boilers with Hellcat technology continue to outperform the market. North America water treatment sales increased 8% in 2024 as acquisition-related dealer sales increases were partially offset by weakness in the retail channel.\nIn China, second quarter third-party sales increased 2% in local currency as a result of sales of kitchen products as well as HVAC products that were partially offset by lower volumes of residential water treatment. While markets for our core products remain challenged, we are pleased with our market share in the premium portion of the water heater and water treatment product categories. However, we have seen pricing and promotion pressures, particularly in the mid-price sector of the market.\nI'm now on Slide 6. This year, we are celebrating our 150th anniversary. It's a time to reflect on those 150 years of living our values of achieving profitable growth, emphasizing innovation, preserving our good name, being a good place to work and being a good citizen. It is also gratifying to be recognized for the continuation of those values.\nSo far in 2024, our team has received several honors that reflect our employees' dedication to our core values. Earlier this year, A. O. Smith was named one of the world's most ethical companies by Ethisphere, a global leader in defining and advancing the standards of ethical business practices. In addition, our commitment to innovation and energy management has resulted in our Nanjing China plant being selected as one of the 2024 Nanjing Environment Protection model enterprises, in recognition of our waste and emission reduction efforts.\nWe also received a 2024 ENERGY STAR Sustained Excellence Partner of the Year Award from the EPA for the sixth year in a row, for our long-term commitment to energy management through our products. In addition, we were named 2024 U.S. News Best Companies to Work for in Manufacturing by U.S. News & World Report. While the reward is the satisfaction our team receives for doing the right thing and living our values. These owners validate our values as a differentiator for our employees and stakeholders.\nI'll now turn the call over to Chuck, who will provide more details on our second quarter performance.\n\nCharles T. Lauber\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, A. O. Smith Corp.\n\nThank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I'm on Slide 7. Second quarter sales in the North America segment were $791 million, a 9% increase compared with 2023, driven by higher water heater and boiler volumes as well as year-over-year pricing actions. North America segment earnings of $198 million, increased 2% compared with 2023 adjusted segment revenues. The higher segment earnings were primarily driven by increased volumes and pricing that were partially offset by higher steel costs and higher selling expenses to support our growth initiatives, including the launch of our gas tankless products. Segment margin was 25.1%, a decrease of 180 basis points year-over-year. The lower segment margin was due to the reasons I reviewed with regard to segment earnings, which more than offset higher volumes in the quarter.\nMoving to Slide 8. Rest of the World segment sales of $245 million were essentially flat to last year and included unfavorable currency translation of approximately $7 million, primarily related to China as well as intersegment sales associated with recently launched tankless water heaters. Segment third-party sales increased 3% on a constant currency basis. The increase was partially driven by higher sales of kitchen and HVAC products, partially offset by lower sales of residential water treatment products in China.\nIndia sales grew 16% in local currency in the quarter, driven by growth in both water heater and water treatment categories with particular strength in our e-commerce, retail and commercial end markets. Rest of the World segment earnings of $26 million decreased slightly compared to segment earnings in 2023, primarily due to the unfavorable product mix and sales promotions in China. Third-party segment operating margin was 11.5%, slightly lower than segment margin in 2023.\nPlease turn to Slide 9. We generated free cash flow of $119 million during the first half of 2024, a decrease from the same period last year primarily as a result of higher inventory and accounts receivable balance as well as higher incentive payments associated with record sales and profits last year, which more than offset higher earnings and higher trade payable balances.\nCapital expenditures increased $21 million year-over-year driven by our expansion projects. Our cash balance totaled $233 million at the end of June and our net cash position was $93 million. Our leverage ratio was 6.8% as measured by total debt to total capital.\nNow let's turn to Slide 10. In addition to returning capital to shareholders, we continue to see opportunities for organic growth, innovation and new product development across all of our product lines and geographies. As Kevin mentioned earlier, we signed an agreement last week to acquire Pureit from Unilever for $120 million. Pureit offers a broad range of residential water purification solutions and has annual sales of approximately USD 60 million primarily in India. The addition of Pureit strengthens our leadership position as a global supplier of premium water treatment products and will double our market penetration in South Asia. The acquisition will also support our corporate strategy by enhancing our premium product portfolio and distribution footprint.\nPlease turn to Slide 11 and our 2024 earnings guidance and outlook. We narrowed our 2024 EPS outlook to an expected range of $3.95 to $4.10 per share. The midpoint of our EPS range has not changed and represents an increase of 6% compared with 2023 adjusted EPS. Our outlook is based on a number of key assumptions, including; our guidance assumes that our steel costs in the full year 2024 will be roughly flat to 2023, our outlook assumes non-steel material costs are similar in 2024 as they were in 2023, our guidance also assumes a relatively stable supply chain environment similar to what we experienced throughout 2023.\nWe began shipping our internally designed and manufactured gas tankless products in the second quarter. These products are being manufactured in our China facility until our North America capacity is completed in 2025. Associated import tariffs and other launch costs will impact North America margins by approximately 50 basis points in 2024. The tariff will be eliminated when production moves to Juarez, Mexico.\nFor the year, CapEx should be between $105 million and $115 million, an increase over the last several years due to our capacity expansion projects, including our gas tankless facility in Juarez, expansion of our engineering capabilities in Lebanon, Tennessee and adding high-efficiency commercial water heating manufacturing capacity ahead of the 2026 regulatory changes.\nWe expect to generate free cash flow of between $525 million and $575 million. Corporate and other expenses are expected to be approximately $65 million. Our effective tax rate is estimated to be approximately 24%. And we expect to repurchase approximately $300 million of our shares of stock resulting in outstanding diluted shares of 147 million at the end of 2024.\nI'll now turn the call back over to Kevin who will provide more color on our key markets and top line growth outlook and segment expectations for 2024 while staying on Slide 11. Kevin?\n\nKevin J. Wheeler\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, A. O. Smith Corp.\n\nThank you, Chuck. We reaffirm our outlook that 2024 sales will grow 3% to 5% compared to 2023, which includes the following assumptions. Our outlook includes previously announced price increases in North America water heating of 4% on most of our water heater products. Price [indiscernible] for heat pump products is 8%. We began to see realization of the price increases in the second quarter.\nWe believe that a pre-buy ahead of the price increases pulled forward some demand in the first half of the year for both residential and commercial water heaters. We have seen some softness in our orders in July. Due to normal seasonality in the pre-buy, we maintain our projection that 2024 U.S. residential industry unit volumes to be flat to last year. Our projection that U.S. commercial water heater industry volumes will increase low single digits in 2024 is also unchanged. Our outlook assumes that new residential home construction and product replacement will remain at levels similar to last year.\nIn China, we believe the economy and consumer confidence remain weak. We continue to see headwinds in consumer demand. While we are cautious about the second half of the year, we maintain our 2024 third-party sales growth guidance to be between 0% and 3% in local currency. Our forecast assumes a negative currency translation impact of approximately 2% for the year.\nWe reaffirm that we expect our boiler sales to grow 8% to 10% over last year. Our sales growth guidance for North America water treatment of an increase of 8% to 10% is also unchanged. Based on our 2024 assumptions, we expect our North America segment margin to be approximately 25%. And the Rest of World third-party segment margin to be approximately 10%.\nPlease turn to Slide 12. We are pleased with our performance in the first half of 2024. We saw strong growth in water heaters in the first half of the year, which we believe was partially driven by the prebuy. We are pleased to see a return to growth in our North America boiler business as channel inventory levels normalize and we continue to benefit from the transition to higher energy efficiency boilers, particularly in commercial applications.\nOur 3 capital expansion projects that will add capacity for key product categories in North America are on track and will position us well for long-term growth. India remains on track for another year of projected double-digit sales growth, and we're excited to complete the Pureit acquisition later this year. which will double our sales in the South Asia region, Pureit's strong brand and strength in the e-commerce channel will complement our premium brand will make us the #3 residential water treatment company in India.\nEven as we celebrate our 150th anniversary and a rich history of innovation with employees, customers and partners, we remain focused on meeting the needs of our customers and executing our key strategic priorities to advance our leadership position in heating and treating water around the globe.\nThat concludes our prepared remarks, and we are now available for your questions.",

Welcome to the 3M first quarter earnings conference call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded, Tuesday, April 30, 2024.\nI would now like to turn the call over to Bruce Jermeland, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at 3M.\n\nBruce Jermeland\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter earnings conference call. With me today are Mike Roman, 3M's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Monish Patolawala, our President and Chief Financial Officer. Mike and Monish will make some formal comments, then we'll take your questions. Please note that today's earnings release and slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on the home page of our Investor Relations website at 3m.com.\nPlease turn to Slide 2. Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement. During today's conference call, we'll be making certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M's future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions.\nPlease note, throughout today's presentation, we'll be making references to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures can be found in the attachments to today's press release.\nPlease turn to Slide 3. During today's presentation, Mike and Monish will discuss our total company Q1 2024 results, which are inclusive of the Health Care business and are on the same basis on which 3M provided first quarter guidance back in January. As we have mentioned, it is important to note that Solventum Corporation's separate financial reporting will differ from the basis of presentation used by 3M for the Health Care segment.\n3M's full year 2024 earnings guidance initiated today is on a continuing operations basis reflecting Solventum as discontinued operations for the full year, including the first quarter of 2024. In addition, we will be treating changes in the value of our 19.9% equity interest in Solventum as a special item in arriving at non-GAAP results adjusted for special items.\nAnd finally, we are providing additional financial information this quarter in our press release and slide presentation given the impact of the Solventum spin. We hope that you find the information useful in underseeing our Q1 performance and outlook for 2024. We also plan on filing additional information on a continuing operations basis, including in late July or early August, Form 8-Ks with recast 2023, Form 10-K and Q1 2024 Form 10-Q information.\nPlease turn to Slide 4 for a summary of our updated post-spin financial reporting framework. Beginning with the second quarter, Safety and Industrial, Transportation and Electronics and Consumer business segment operating income will include the impact of the dissynergies or stranded costs previously associated with Solventum. In addition, we have added a new operating category named Other for Solventum transition service agreement costs, which 3M will be reimbursed for beginning here in April. Finally, corporate and allocated will incorporate the commercial agreements between 3M and Solventum that started on April 1.\nOne final comment. In the appendix on Slide 27, you will find information on our public water suppliers and Combat Arms legal settlements, including the pretax payment schedule by year and total combined pretax present value and after-tax estimates.\nWith that, please turn to Slide 5, and I'll now hand the call off to Mike. Mike?\n\nMichael F. Roman\n\nnullChairman & Chief Executive Officer\n\nThank you, Bruce. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. In the first quarter, we delivered strong results that were better than our expectations as we return to adjusted organic growth and achieve double-digit adjusted earnings growth. We improved performance across our businesses and in our operational execution. We also completed the spinoff of Solventum and finalized 2 major legal settlements.\nOur results demonstrate the positive impact of the changes we have made over the last several years. We've also made significant progress in executing our strategic priorities, which has positioned the company for long-term shareholder value creation.\nIn the first quarter, on an adjusted basis, we delivered revenue of $7.7 billion, including improved organic growth, operating margins of 22%, up 400 basis points; and earnings of $2.39 per share, up 21%. On April 1, we successfully completed the spin-off of our Health Care business, Solventum, creating 2 world-class companies well positioned to deliver greater shareholder returns through distinct and compelling investment profiles. As independent companies, both 3M and Solventum are better able to tailor their capital allocation and investment priorities to win in their respective markets.\nI want to thank and congratulate the teams whose dedication made this major accomplishment possible and wish the entire Solventum team, led by CEO, Brian Hansen, great success in the future.\nIn Q1, we also finalized 2 major legal settlements. First, our settlement agreement with U.S.-based public water suppliers received widespread support and participation. It was granted final approval by the court on March 29. We anticipate making total payments with a pretax present value of up to $10.3 billion over the next 13 years. The first payment is expected in the third quarter of 2024.\nIt is important to note our agreement with public water suppliers addresses the detection of any type of PFAS at any level. This includes PFAS that have already been detected or may be detected in the future, including those that are the subject of the U.S. EPA's recently announced limits in drinking water.\nSecond is our settlement of the Combat Arms multi-district litigation. As of today, more than 99% of claimants have chosen to participate. This provides us the certainty and finality the settlement was intended to achieve. We anticipate making total payments up to a pretax present value of $5.3 billion through 2029. We also continue to make good progress on our exit of all PFAS manufacturing. We are on track to meet our commitment by the end of 2025 and are working closely with each of our customers to complete an orderly transition.\nIn summary, the progress across all 3 of our strategic priorities has helped make 3M stronger, leaner and more focused on what we do best: utilize 3M science to make indispensable products for our customers.\nI will now turn the call over to Monish for more details regarding our performance in Q1 and to discuss our guidance for 2024.\n\nMonish D. Patolawala\n\nSenior VP & CFO, 3M Company\n\nThank you, Mike, and I wish you all a very good morning. Please turn to Slide 6. We continue to build upon the strong foundation we laid in 2023. We remain focused on our priorities, and the team continues to deliver improving results.\nWe posted strong adjusted results in the quarter, including sales of $7.7 billion, operating margin of 21.9%, earnings per share of $2.39 and free cash flow of over $800 million. These results were better than our expectations as we continue to drive strong operational execution and spending discipline. We also benefited from significant operating leverage, particularly in Transportation and Electronics, which is driven by strong organic volume growth in electronics and automotive. Our results also benefited from the acceleration of certain nonrecurring actions, which I will go through in more detail on the next slide.\nOur first quarter adjusted sales of $7.7 billion exceeded our expectations of $7.6 billion as we delivered improved organic growth, which was partially offset by a headwind from foreign currency translation. We delivered adjusted organic growth of nearly 1% or up 2.4%, excluding geographic prioritization, product portfolio initiatives and last year's disposable respirator comp.\nOrganic growth was driven by our Transportation and Electronics business as the team won share gains from spec-in wins and new product introductions with automotive and consumer electronics OEMs. This drove strong organic growth as the OEMs ramp production for new launches for end customers.\nGeographically, year-on-year strength in China and EMEA was driven by our strength in electronics and automotive. Sales in the U.S. were flat year-on-year with industrial and health care end markets showing relative strength, offset by consumer retail softness.\nPlease turn to Slide 7 for details of the components that drove our year-on-year operating margin and earnings performance. As mentioned, on an adjusted basis, we delivered operating margins of 21.9%, up 400 basis points; and earnings of $2.39 per share, up 21% versus last year's first quarter. Our first quarter performance was driven by improved organic growth, particularly in Transportation and Electronics, along with a continued focus on operations, restructuring actions and spending discipline, which drove better-than-expected improvements in operating margins of 340 basis points and earnings of $0.42 per share.\nAs disclosed in our Form 10-K and as factored into our 1Q guidance that we provided in January, our year-on-year margins and earnings were benefited from the delay of our stock-based compensation grants from a normal timing in the first quarter to the second quarter due to the Solventum spin. This timing adjustment added 140 basis points to margins and $0.15 to earnings per share as compared to last year's first quarter.\nWe also accelerated certain nonrecurring benefits, including property sales as we progress on our asset-light strategy. This benefited first quarter year-on-year operating margins by approximately 70 basis points and earnings by $0.08 per share.\nWe accelerated restructuring actions in the quarter, incurring pretax charges of $122 million, which was higher than our guidance of $75 million to $100 million. This compared to last year's restructuring charge of $52 million, resulting in a negative year-on-year impact to margins of 90 basis points and $0.10 to earnings.\nForeign currency negatively impacted adjusted margins by 60 basis points or a negative $0.09 per share as a result of the strong U.S. dollar. This headwind was larger than we had expected. The reconsolidation of Aearo Technologies in Q2 2023 resulted in a $0.01 benefit year-on-year to earnings per share and was neutral to margins. As expected, our adjusted tax rate was 20.5% this year, which was higher than when compared to 17.7% in last year's first quarter, resulting in a $0.09 headwind to earnings.\nAnd finally, other financial items and shares outstanding netted to a positive $0.04 per share year-on-year impact. This benefit was primarily driven by interest income on proceeds from Solventum's issuance of $8.4 billion in debt prior to the separation, partially offset by a non-op pension headwind.\nPlease turn to Slide 8. First quarter adjusted free cash flow was over $800 million. Adjusted free cash flow conversion was 63%, in line with our historical first quarter trends. We continue to focus on driving working capital efficiency, including improved cash conversion cycle times. I am pleased with the progress we have made, yet there remains significant opportunity to further improve performance in all aspects of working capital.\nAdjusted capital expenditures were $355 million in the quarter, down 20% year-on-year. The lower year-on-year spend is primarily due to nearing completion on water filtration investments at our manufacturing facilities. And finally, we returned $835 million to shareholders via dividends.\nTurning to the balance sheet. Net debt at the end of Q1 stood at $10.4 billion, a decline of 13% year-on-year, driven by strong free cash flow generation of our business. In late February, Solventum issued debt of [indiscernible] the repayment obligation went why 3M kept approximately $7.7 billion in proceeds upon spin on April 1. These proceeds, combined with our business' strong and reliable cash generation, have further strengthened our balance sheet. In addition, the retained 19.9% equity stake in Solventum will provide additional future liquidity.\nAlso, during the quarter, we retired [ $2.9 ] billion of debt. Our strong capital structure and robust cash generation provides us with the financial flexibility to continue to invest in our business, return capital to shareholders and meet the cash flow needs related to legal matters.\nNow please turn to Slide 10 for a discussion on our business group performance. Starting with our Safety and Industrial business, which posted sales of $2.7 billion, down 1.4% organically. Industrial end-market demand remained mixed in the quarter. We delivered strong double-digit growth in roofing granules driven by replacement demand and storm repair.\nIndustrial adhesives and tapes posted low single-digit organic growth driven by spec-in wins in new bonding solutions for consumer electronics devices. The personal safety business declined low single digits as strong demand for self-contained breathing apparatus for the first responder market was more than offset by year-on-year comp headwind from disposable respirators.\nAnd finally, we experienced year-on-year organic sales declines in electrical markets, abrasives, automotive aftermarket and industrial specialties. Geographically, industrial markets in the United States were up 1%, while China remained challenged. Adjusted operating income was $664 million, up 18% versus last year. Adjusted operating margins were 24.3%, up 410 basis points year-on-year. This performance was driven by benefits from ongoing productivity actions, timing of stock-based compensation and strong spending discipline. These benefits more than offset headwinds from lower sales volume and higher restructuring costs.\nMoving to Transportation and Electronics on Slide 11, which posted adjusted sales of $1.8 billion or up 6.7% organically. Consumer electronics end markets were stable in the quarter, while the semiconductor market remains soft. Our electronics business outperformed the market, up mid-teens organically year-on-year. The introduction of new products continues to be well received in the market as evidenced by recent spec-in wins. In addition, we also experienced continued channel inventory normalization as electronics demand stabilizes.\nOur auto OEM business increased 13% in Q1 versus a 1% decline in global car and light truck builds. We continue to win increased penetration, including strong momentum in automotive electrification, which was up over 30% year-on-year in Q1. We also saw an increase in channel inventory at tier suppliers during the quarter given the forecasted 8% sequential increase in the auto OEM builds from Q1 to Q2.\nLooking at the rest of Transportation and Electronics. Commercial branding and transportation grew low single digits organically, and advanced materials was flat year-on-year. While our Transportation and Electronics business is off to a good start to the year, we estimate that approximately 2/3 of the strong first quarter organic growth was driven by initial buy ahead by customers as they ramp production and introduce new products, along with channel inventory normalization.\nTransportation and Electronics delivered $479 million in adjusted operating income, up 68% year-on-year. Adjusted operating margins were 26.3%, up 960 basis points versus Q1 last year. The team achieved this result through strong leverage on improved electronics volumes, ongoing productivity actions, strong spending discipline and the previously mentioned timing of stock-based compensation grants. Partially offsetting these benefits were headwinds from restructuring costs.\nTurning to Slide 12. The Consumer business posted first quarter sales of $1.1 billion. Organic sales declined 3.9% year-on-year with continued softness in consumer discretionary spending, which included a 2.4 percentage point impact from portfolio and geographic prioritization. Home improvement and consumer safety and well-being declined low single digits. And home and auto care declined mid-single digits, while packaging and expression declined high single digits organically.\nWe continue to invest in the business, including supporting successful new product launches, such as Command heavyweight hanging products and sustainably focused Scotch-Brite cleaning tools and Scotch home and office tapes.\nOrganic growth declined across all geographies. The U.S. was down low single digits, Asia Pacific mid-single digits and EMEA high single digits. Consumer's first quarter operating income was $216 million, up 21% compared to last year with operating margins of 19%, up 400 basis points year-on-year. The improvement in operating margins was driven by benefits from productivity actions, portfolio initiatives, strong spending discipline and the previously mentioned timing of stock-based compensation grants. Partially offsetting these benefits were headwinds from lower sales volume and higher restructuring costs.\nFinally, included in the appendix is a slide in the first quarter performance for Health Care. The business delivered results within our expectations with organic growth of 1% and operating margins of 17.5%.\nNow turning to guidance for the year on Slide 14. As Bruce mentioned at the beginning of the call, our full year 2024 outlook initiated today is on a continuing operations basis, reflecting Health Care as discontinued operations for the full year, including the first quarter.\nWe have confidence in the momentum we have built throughout 2023. We continue to deliver strong results, including the first quarter, which was better than expectations. The guidance initiated today represents a return to growth, adjusted margins up 200 to 275 basis points year-on-year versus the illustrative midpoint of 18.7% for 2023 and over 15% earnings per share growth at the midpoint.\nWe anticipate full year adjusted organic growth of flat to up 2% or up 1% to 3%, excluding the impact from geographic prioritization and product portfolio initiatives we are taking. This estimated organic growth rate incorporates full year external forecast for major end markets, including an expectation of continued mix growth in industrial end markets. Automotive OEM build rates are currently forecasted to be down slightly. Consumer electronics are expected to grow low single digits for the year, while semiconductor market is currently forecasted to start the year slow and improve as the year progresses. And finally, consumer retail discretionary spending is expected to remain muted for the year.\nAs mentioned, we expect a strong expansion in adjusted operating margins of approximately 200 to 275 basis points year-on-year, up from an estimated midpoint of 18.7% in 2023.\nWith respect to adjusted EPS, we anticipate full year 2024 earnings in the range of $6.80 to $7.30 per share on a continuing operations basis or over 15% year-on-year growth at the midpoint.\nTurning to cash. Our businesses continue to deliver strong and consistent free cash flow. Our expectation is that adjusted free cash flow conversion performance post spin will remain in the range of 90% to 110%.\nPlease turn to Slide 15 for more details on our full year guidance. outlook is for normal sequential patterns through the year coupled with the end-market trends just discussed. As a result, we anticipate that our second half of the year sales will be slightly stronger than the first half. Our expectations also include a 1% foreign currency headwind to sales given the strength of the U.S. dollar at current spot rates or a negative $0.20 to earnings per share.\nWe also anticipate an approximately 75 basis point benefit to sales from the commercial agreement with Solventum. Please note that this benefit will be reflected within acquisition and divestitures from an external reporting perspective.\nWe expect adjusted operating income and earnings per share to show relative strength in the second half of the year. This is primarily due to the impact from the timing of the Solventum spin on April 1, along with our pretax restructuring charges of $250 million to $300 million that are weighted 70% to the first half of the year. We will continue to benefit from productivity and restructuring actions, partially offset by increased investments in the business as we progress through the year.\nLooking at below-the-line items. We estimate full year other expense net will be in the range of $75 million to $100 million mostly weighted to the second half of the year. And our 2024 adjusted tax rate is expected to be in the range of 19% to 20% with the first half of the year coming in at the high end of the range.\nAs Bruce mentioned earlier and detailed further on Slide 26 in the appendix, the new operating category named Other is forecasted to have a net operating loss of approximately neutral to $25 million. This range includes first quarter net operating loss of approximately $65 million on a continuing operations basis.\nBeginning in April, transition service agreements costs plus a markup will be reimbursed to 3M, and therefore, we will generate modest income in the remaining 3 quarters of the year. Finally, corporate and unallocated includes full year 2024 sales in the range of $225 million to $275 million for commercial agreements with Solventum beginning in April. We expect full year corporate and unallocated net operating loss in the range of $125 million to $175 million. These ranges include first quarter revenue of approximately $25 million and net operating loss of approximately $75 million.\nAs we have previously discussed, we estimate annualized dissynergies of approximately $150 million to $175 million. These costs were previously associated with Solventum and will now be allocated to Safety and Industrial, Transportation and Electronics and Consumers starting in April.\nSpecific to Q2, we expect continued strong execution to drive operating performance. As disclosed in our Form 10-K, stock-based compensation grants were delayed to Q2. As a result, we expect to incur $125 million to $150 million in expense in Q2. We will also increase investments to support end-market demand and drive growth and productivity.\nPlease turn to Slide 16 for more details by business group. Taking into account my earlier comments regarding current full year macroeconomic and major end-market forecasts, we estimate organic sales growth in Safety and Industrial to be flat to up low single digits. Adjusted organic sales growth for Transportation and Electronics is forecasted to be up low single digits. This is better than our estimated range of flat to up low single digits provided in January, recognizing our strong Q1 growth performance.\nAnd in Consumer, we estimate organic sales to be down low single digits, which includes our ongoing product portfolio initiatives. These actions are estimated to create a year-on-year organic growth headwind for the Consumer business of approximately 2 percentage points.\nI want to take a moment to thank our team for the work they have done in successfully executing across our 3 strategic priorities. Their disciplined work has created value and returned capital to shareholders with the successful spinout of our Health Care business. They have also reduced risk by reaching 2 large settlements while making progress on the exit of PFAS manufacturing. And most importantly, our teams have made tremendous progress on fundamentally improving how we work, which is driving better performance across the business.\nIn closing, we delivered a strong start to the year. As we look ahead, we are focused on building on our momentum, supporting expectations for a return to organic top line growth, margin expansion, investments in high-growth and attractive end markets and continued strong cash generation. This leaves us well positioned for long-term success and consistent value creation for our customers and shareholders.\nPlease turn to Slide 17, and I will turn it back over to Mike. Mike?\n\nMichael F. Roman\n\nnullChairman & Chief Executive Officer\n\nThanks, Monish. Paying a competitive dividend has been a priority for 3M for more than 100 years. This will continue to be true following the spin-off of Solventum. As part of the spin, we distributed [ 80.1% ] of Solventum's outstanding shares to our shareholders and post spin have made the decision to reset 3M's dividend. As a result, we anticipate a dividend of approximately 40% of adjusted free cash flow. This represents a dividend that is in line with our industrial peers and well above the S&P 500 median with the potential to increase over time. We expect to seek Board approval to declare the second quarter dividend in May with payments anticipated in June. In addition, post spin, we have stepped back into the market for share repurchases.\nBefore I conclude, let me emphasize some important points from the quarter. Q1 was a strong start to the year driven by significant improvements in operational execution as well as the achievement of several major milestones toward our strategic goals, including the successful spin-off of Solventum and the settlement of 2 major legal matters.\nI would like to thank our people for their dedication and continued focus on delivering value for our customers and shareholders. Through their efforts, we are well positioned to deliver a strong 2024.\nTomorrow, May 1, I transition into the role of Executive Chairman. I look forward to working with Bill Brown as he assumes the role of CEO.\nThat concludes our formal remarks, and we will now take your questions.",

Smith Corporation Earnings Call\n\nAOSNYSEAPR 25, 4:00 PM\n\nOperator\n\nGood day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the A. O. Smith First Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised today's conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Helen Gurholt. Please go ahead.\n\nHelen E. Gurholt\n\nVP of IR and Financial Planning & Analysis, A. O. Smith Corporation\n\nGood morning, and welcome to the A. O. Smith First Quarter Conference Call. I'm Helen Gurholt, Vice President, Investor Relations and Financial Planning and Analysis. Joining me today are Kevin Wheeler, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Chuck Lauber, Chief Financial Officer.\nIn order to provide improved transparency into the operating results of our business, we provided non-GAAP measures. Free cash flow is defined as cash from operations less capital expenditures, adjusted earnings, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted segment earnings and adjusted corporate expenses exclude the impact of impairment expenses. Reconciliations from GAAP measures to non-GAAP measures are provided in the appendix at the end of this presentation and on our website.\nA friendly reminder that some of our comments and answers during this conference call will be forward-looking statement that are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include matters that we described in this morning's press release, among others. Also, as a courtesy to others in the question queue, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up per turn. If you have multiple questions, please rejoin the queue. We will be using slides as we move through today's call. you can access them on our website at investor.aosmith.com.\nI will now turn the call over to Kevin to begin our prepared remarks.\n\nKevin J. Wheeler\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, A. O. Smith Corp.\n\nThank you, Helen, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start off by extending a warm welcome to Steve Shafer, who has recently joined A. O. Smith as our Chief Operating Officer. Steve is an accomplished business leader with deep global experience in manufacturing and leading innovative businesses. His strategic acumen and extensive global leadership experience will prove invaluable as we continue to focus on innovation and driving operational performance to enhance shareholder value.\nLet's now turn to the quarter on Slide 4. Our global A. O. Smith team delivered sales of $979 million in 2024 and EPS of $1, a 6% increase over 2023 adjusted EPS. North America sales increased 2% and segment margins increased 80 basis points due to a positive mix, higher commercial volumes and lower material costs principally steel. Our Rest of World segment sales grew 4%, recently introduced products in China contributed to the majority of the growth. In India, our sales grew 16% in local currency in the first quarter of 2024.\nPlease turn to Slide 5. We North America water heater sales grew 2% in the first quarter due to higher commercial volumes and a positive mix towards commercial gas and high-efficiency products, including heat pumps. Volumes were favorably influenced by our price increase effective March 1. However, year-over-year comps were somewhat muted by a strong first quarter 2023. Our North America order sales were flat compared to the first quarter of 2023. As a reminder, we do not begin to see the effects of the 2023 channel inventory destocking until the second quarter of last year.\nWe are pleased to see sales of our high-efficiency residential orders returned to more normalized levels in the first quarter of 2024. Sales of our CREST commercial borders with HealthCap technology increased over 30% in the quarter. North America water treatment sales grew 4% in 2024, driven by acquisition-related sales growth and pricing. Organic growth in the e-commerce and specialty wholesale channels were offset by softness in the direct-to-consumer and retail channels.\nIn China, first quarter third-party sales increased 6% in local currency. Our recently launched Kitchen products continue to be well received in the market and provide bundling opportunities that drive overall sales growth. Sales of HVAC systems which generally combined a combi boiler with the heat pump water heater increased 14% local currency in the quarter as well.\nI will now turn the call over to Chuck, who will provide more details on our first quarter performance.\n\nCharles T. Lauber\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, A. O. Smith Corp.\n\nThank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I'm on Slide 6. First quarter sales in the North America segment were $766 million, a 2% increase compared with 2023 driven by higher commercial volumes and the benefits of mix shift towards high-efficiency water heaters, including heat pumps.\nNorth America segment earnings of $199 million increased 5% compared with 2023. Segment margin was 25.9%, an increase of 80 basis points year-over-year. The higher segment earnings and margin were primarily driven by positive mix and lower material costs, partially offset by selling and advertising expenses in support of higher sales.\nMoving to Slide 7. Rest of the World segment sales of $227 million increased 4% year-over-year, including unfavorable currency translation of $9 million primarily related to China. Segment third-party sales of $219 million increased 4% on a constant currency basis. The increase was primarily driven by higher sales of kitchen and HVAC products in China. India sales increased 16% in local currency in the quarter, driven by growth in both water heating and water treatment with particular strength in our e-commerce and commercial end markets. Rest of the World segment earnings of $17 million decreased slightly compared to adjusted segment earnings in 2023, primarily due to sales promotions associated with new product introductions and product mix in China. Third-party segment operating margin was 7.9%, a decrease of 20 basis points compared to adjusted segment margins in 2023.\nPlease turn to Slide 8. We generated free cash flow of $85 million during the first 3 months of 2024, a decrease from the same period last year, primarily as a result of higher incentive payments associated with record sales and profits last year and higher inventory levels that more than offset higher earnings and lower accounts payable balances. Capital expenditures increased $11 million year-over-year, driven by expansion projects. Our cash balance totaled $303 million at the end of March, and our net cash position was $183 million. Our leverage ratio was 6% as measured by total debt to total capital.\nLet's now turn to Slide 9. In addition to returning capital to shareholders, we continue to see opportunities for investment in organic growth, innovation and new product development across all of our product lines and geographies. We target strategic acquisitions that meet our financial metrics as accretive to earnings in the first year and return our cost of capital in 3 years. In the first quarter, we welcomed Impact Water products to the A. O. Smith family. Impact supports our growth strategy by expanding the West Coast presence of our water treatment business.\nPlease turn to Slide 10 in our 2024 earnings guidance and outlook. We reaffirm our 2024 EPS outlook of an expected range of $3.90 to $4.15 per share. The midpoint of our EPS range represents an increase of 6% compared with 2023 adjusted EPS. Our outlook is based on a number of key assumptions, including our guidance assumes that our steel costs in the full year 2024 will be a slight headwind compared to 2023. We project an increase in steel input costs in the second quarter of approximately 20% over the first quarter.\nOur full year steel input cost projection includes a slight decline in the steel price index in the second half of the year. Our outlook assumes non-steel material costs are similar in 2024 as they were in 2023. Our guidance also assumes a relatively stable supply chain environment, similar to what we've experienced throughout 2023. We introduced our internally designed and manufactured gas tankless products earlier this year. These products will be manufactured in our China facility until our North America capacity is completed in 2025. We expect customer shipments to begin later in the second quarter. Associated import tariffs and other launch costs will negatively impact North America margins by approximately 50 basis points when we begin to ship product. We are investing in manufacturing of Juarez, Mexico that will eliminate the tariff in the future.\nFor the year, CapEx should be between $105 million and $115 million, an increase year-over-year due to capital -- the capacity expansion projects related to our gas tankless manufacturing facility at Juarez, expansion of our engineering capabilities in Lebanon, Tennessee, and adding high-efficiency commercial water heating manufacturing capacity to align with regulatory changes coming in 2026.\nWe expect to generate strong free cash flow of between $525 million and $575 million. Corporate and other expenses are expected to be approximately $65 million. Our effective tax rate is estimated to be between 24% to 24.5% and we continue to expect to repurchase approximately $300 million of our shares of stock, resulting in our outstanding diluted shares of $147 million at the end of the year.\nI will now turn the call back over to Kevin, who will provide more color on key markets and top line growth outlook and segment expectations for 2024, staying on Slide 13. Kevin?\n\nKevin J. Wheeler\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, A. O. Smith Corp.\n\nThank you, Chuck. We reaffirm our outlook that 2024 sales will grow between 3% and 5% compared to 2023, which includes the following assumptions. We maintain our projection that 2024 U.S. residential industry unit volumes will be approximately flat to last year after seeing a 6% growth in 2023. Our assumption projects that new home construction and proactive replacement remain at levels similar to last year.\nOur projection that U.S. commercial water heater industry volumes will increase low single digits in 2024 is unchanged. Our outlook includes the announced price increases in North America water heating of 4% on most of our water heater products. Price increase for heat pumps products is 8%. Our April orders are strong year-over-year as a result of resilient and demand in our management of prebuy orders. In China, we believe that the economy and consumer confidence remains weak. The real estate and housing markets are challenged.\nWe have not seen signs of improvement. Through March and April, we have seen headwinds in consumer demand. Given the continued weak economy and the softness we are seeing, we are lowering our 2024 third-party sales growth guidance in China to be flat to 3% up in local currency. Our forecast assumes a negative currency translation impact of approximately 1% for the year. We ended the second quarter with a strong backlog in our boiler business and reaffirm that we expect boiler sales to grow between 8% and 10% over last year.\nWe are revising our sales growth guidance for North America water treatment products from an increase of 10% to 12% to an increase of 8% to 10%. This reduction is a reflection of softness we are experiencing in our direct-to-consumer business, average order price in our retail channel, particularly for water softeners. Based on our 2024 assumptions, we expect our North America segment margin to be approximately 25% and Rest of World third-party segment margin to be approximately 10%.\nPlease turn to Slide 11. We are pleased with our performance in early 2024. We had year-over-year growth in residential and commercial water heaters, along with a strong mix in the first quarter and we are pleased with our order rates we are seeing in this month. India is on track for another year of projected double-digit sales growth. During the quarter, we initiated three capital expansion projects that will add capacity for key product categories in North America.\nFirst, we broke ground on our tankless manufacturing facility in Juarez, which is on the same campus as our current residential water heater facility. Production in Juarez will improve logistics as well as eliminated tariff on products currently manufactured in our China facility. Production is targeted to begin in 2025. In addition, we launched our high-efficiency commercial gas water heater expansion in McBee, South Carolina. This expansion will increase our production capacity for our high-efficiency products, including our market-leading Cyclone product. As a reminder, Department of Energy Regulatory changes largely impacting commercial gas water heater efficiency levels will eliminate lower efficiency products from the market beginning in late 2026.\nFinally, in support of our R&D and product innovation within our commercial water heater and boiler markets, we have initiated the expansion of our 11 in Tennessee commercial lab and engineering test facility. The state-of-the-art facility will combine our commercial water engineering expertise under one roof and allow for cross-functional collaboration, particularly with mutual technologies like heat pump. We are in the early stages of all three projects, but we're off to a very good start. As always, we remain focused on meeting the needs of our customers as well as executing our key strategic priorities to advance our position as a leader in heating and treating water around the world.\nWith that, we conclude our prepared remarks, and we are now available for your questions.",

Welcome to the 3M Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Tuesday, January 23, 2024.\nI would now like to turn the call over to Bruce Jermeland, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at 3M.\n\nBruce Jermeland\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings conference call. With me today are Mike Roman, 3M's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Monish Patolawala, our President and Chief Financial Officer. Mike and Monish will make some formal comments, and then we'll take your questions. Please note that today's earnings release and slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on the homepage of our Investor Relations website at 3m.com.\nPlease turn to Slide 2. Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement. During today's conference call, we'll be making certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M's future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-Q lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions.\nPlease note throughout today's presentation, we'll be making references to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures can be found in the attachments to today's press release.\nPlease turn to Slide 3. During today's presentation, Mike and Monish will discuss our 2024 outlook. This outlook will be provided on the same adjusted basis used during 2023. In the coming months, there are significant milestones that the company expects to complete, including the spin of the health care business and the finalization of the public water supplier and Combat Arms' legal settlements.\nThe health care spend remains on track for the first half of 2024, subject to customary closing conditions as detailed in our SEC filings. We continue to expect the business to be spun off with an estimated net leverage of 3x to 3.5x EBITDA, and with the proceeds to be distributed at 3M prior to the completion of the spin.\nWe are working through the processes with all parties in the courts in both the public water supplier and Combat Arms Earplug legal settlements. Our goal is our finalization and ultimate implementation. Absent the proceeds from the intended spin-off of the health care business, the company has not concluded how it would fund amounts due under the public water supplier and Combat Arms Earplug legal settlements. Therefore, we have not included the potential impacts of changes in net debt that may be needed to fund amounts under these agreements.\nFor illustrative purposes only in the absence of the proceeds from the spin, the adjusted earnings per share impact from financing legal settlements could be up to approximately a $0.20 per share headwind based on current market conditions. Also, please note that we will be treating the dilutive earnings impact of 3M's option to satisfy the $1 billion in payments related to the Combat Arms Earplug settlement with 3M shares as an adjustment in arriving at results adjusted for special items.\nFinally, it is important to note that when considering 3M financials post spin, it is not appropriate to simply remove the health care business financial results. There are other factors such as transition services agreements, stranded cost and below-the-line items that need to be taken into account. We are planning on holding an investor meeting later this year following the spin of health care, where we will provide an update to our full year 2024 guidance along with our medium-term financial framework.\nWith that, please turn to Slide 4, and I'll now hand the call off to Mike. Mike?\n\nMichael F. Roman\n\nnullChairman & Chief Executive Officer\n\nThank you, Bruce. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. 3M delivered a strong fourth quarter as we continued to improve our operational performance. With adjusted EPS growth of 11%, operating margin expansion of 180 basis points and robust cash flow. Monish will cover more details of the quarter.\nBut first, I would like to comment on our full year performance. Throughout 2023, we delivered on our commitments with results that exceeded our original earnings and cash flow guidance. While organic sales declined 3%, reflecting softness in certain end markets, including consumer retail and electronics, our disciplined execution supported year-over-year adjusted margin expansion.\nExcluding restructuring, we delivered increased margins of 60 basis points, helping drive earnings of $9.24 per share, along with a 30% increase in free cash flow and a conversion rate of 123%. Our strong cash flow enabled us to continue investing in the business while reducing net debt by $2 billion or 17% and returning $3.3 billion to shareholders through our dividend.\nPlease turn to Slide 5. As you recall, in January of last year, we committed to take a deeper look at everything we do. Our success in 2023 reflects that commitment along with our execution of 3 strategic priorities, which are unlocking value for customers and shareholders, both today and into the future. Let me highlight key achievements in these areas, including how we will build on our progress in 2024, starting with driving performance through the 3M model.\nIn 2023, we implemented the most significant restructuring in 3M history, to streamline the organization, reduce costs at the center and get us closer to our customers, which generated more than $400 million in savings during the year. These efforts included aggressively cutting management layers reducing corporate shared services and modernizing our technology by removing hundreds of legacy systems.\nWe reduced rooftops worldwide and took actions to help us address stranded costs as we progress the health care spend. We simplified our supply chains and are doing more to leverage data and data analytics to visualize the flow of goods so we can serve customers more efficiently. We optimized our global go-to-market models for each of our business groups.\nIn consumer, for example, we simplified our division structure, with each of our global area teams now better aligned around their prioritized product portfolios and brands. At the same time, we have transitioned to an export-led model in approximately 30 smaller countries around the world, allowing us to reduce cost and complexity while still bringing 3M innovation to local customers.\nThe simplification of our organization also frees up resources to prioritize exciting growth opportunities for 3M such as automotive electrification, climate technology and industrial automation. While we have more work to do in 2024, our actions are helping us improve our operational performance and create a more competitive 3M.\nOur next priority is the spin-off of Solventum, our Healthcare business. Last year, we appointed experienced health care leaders to Solventum, including Brian Hansen as CEO, and Carrie Cox as Board Chair; and Wayde McMillan as CFO. The spin is on track to be completed in the first half of this year, and we are confident in the value it will create for customers care providers, patients and shareholders.\nAs we look to 2024, we will continue to optimize our portfolio as we prioritize geographies, markets and products where we see the greatest opportunity. Finally, we are focused on addressing risk and uncertainty. The Combat Arms settlement we announced last August has received strong support from both claimants and the broader military community.\nWe completed the first 3 milestones of the settlement as planned, including earlier this month when we reached agreement with all plaintiffs who are being prepared for trial. We will continue to work with all parties in the courts to fully implement the settlement.\nWith respect to PFAS, our settlement with public water suppliers is on track for the final approval hearing scheduled for February 2. We will continue to address other PFAS litigation by defending ourselves in court or through negotiated resolutions as appropriate. We also remain on schedule to exit all PFAS manufacturing by the end of 2025 with production volumes down 20%.\nLooking back in a year full of change, I am pleased how 3Mers around the world stepped up to lead. Importantly, we stayed relentlessly focused on doing what 3M does best, using material science to make a difference in the world. I see exciting examples of innovation across our company.\nEarlier this month, we unveiled the world's first solar-powered communications headset, building on our decades of leadership in both personal safety and sustainability. We are advancing more durable, energy-efficient and connected vehicles with an array of solutions, including new thermal barrier materials that improve the range and safety of electric car batteries. Just 1 element of our automotive electrification program, which grew 30% in 2023 on top of 30% growth in 2022.\nOur Medical Solutions business, a world leader in advanced wound care just announced a partnership with the U.S. Army, where we will collaborate with the military and leading universities to develop traumatic wound solutions. And in Consumer, last year, we launched more than a dozen new products, including new solutions for heavyweight hanging, part of our $0.5 billion command franchise, which leverages our world-class adhesives technology.\n3M's innovation engine is strong. It will remain the heart of our business and our ability to deliver differentiated value for our customers. In summary, the 3M team delivered a successful 2023, and I am confident we will accelerate our progress in the coming year.\nI will come back to talk about our 2024 priorities and guidance after Monish takes you through the details of the fourth quarter. Monish?\n\nMonish D. Patolawala\n\nSenior VP & CFO, 3M Company\n\nThank you, Mike, and I wish you all a very good morning. Please turn to Slide 6. The fourth quarter culminated a year where we took significant steps to improve our operational execution, resulting in better financial performance.\nWe aggressively controlled spending and initiated restructuring actions to simplify our supply chains, reduce structure and streamline our go-to-market models to better serve customers. At the same time, we continue preparing for the successful spin of our Health Care business and work to reduce risks and uncertainties related to legal matters. While there is more to do, our teams made tremendous progress in 2023 that we build upon in 2024 and beyond.\nLooking at fourth quarter performance, adjusted sales were $7.7 billion at the high end of our guidance. End markets continue to play out as anticipated. Notably, the auto OEM market remained strong in the fourth quarter, and we saw signs of end market stabilization in consumer electronics.\nAs expected, China and consumer retail end markets continue to be soft. Organic sales on an adjusted basis declined 1.4% versus last year. The expected decline in demand for disposable respirator negatively impacted organic growth by 60 basis points of $50 million.\nExcluding this impact, Q4 adjusted organic sales were down 80 basis points. Adjusted operating margins were 20.9%, up 180 basis points year-on-year or up 320 basis points, excluding the impact of restructuring charges. Adjusted earnings were $2.42, up 11% year-on-year.\nVersus our guidance, fourth quarter earnings were benefited by $0.06 due to a lower-than-expected tax rate which was partially offset by the acceleration of restructuring actions, which impacted earnings by approximately $0.03.\nAnd finally, fourth quarter adjusted free cash flow was $2 billion, up 18% year-on-year. For the full year, we delivered $6.3 billion in adjusted free cash flow versus an originally expected range of $4.2 billion to $5 billion at the start of the year.\nPlease turn to Slide 7 for a recap of the components that drove our year-on-year operating margin and earnings performance. Benefits from manufacturing productivity, sourcing actions restructuring, strong spending discipline and selling prices more than offset headwinds from lower sales volumes, investments in the business and last year's disposable respirator sales comparison.\nThis net benefit drove a year-on-year expansion in Q4 operating margins of 400 basis points and earnings per share of $0.43 per share. Pretax restructuring and related charges in the quarter were $109 million or a negative impact to margins of 140 basis points and $0.17 to earnings.\nRaw material, logistics and energy cost inflation was a slight year-on-year headwind of 10 basis points to operating margins of minus $0.01 to adjusted earnings per share.\nForeign currency translation was a negative 70 basis points impact to adjusted operating margins or negative $0.07 per share. This result was primarily due to the net impact of hedging and the devaluation of the Argentinian peso.\nAs previously mentioned, our adjusted tax rate was lower than expected, coming in at 14.9%. This compared to 16.6% in last year's fourth quarter, resulting in a $0.05 benefit to earnings. And finally, other financial items and shares outstanding netted to a positive $0.01 per share year-on-year impact.\nPlease turn to Slide 8. Fourth quarter adjusted free cash flow was $2 billion, up 18% year-on-year with conversion of 145%, up 800 basis points versus last year's Q4. Our ongoing focus on working capital management, especially inventory continues to yield results. Inventory was down $550 million year-on-year and is now at 14.8% of sales, a 90 basis points improvement year-on-year. I am pleased with the progress to date and see significant opportunity to further improve performance in all aspects of working capital.\nAdjusted capital expenditures were $308 million, down 32% versus last year's abnormally high fourth quarter. For the year, we invested over $1.4 billion versus an expected range of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. And finally, we returned $828 million to shareholders via dividends during the quarter.\nTurning to the balance sheet. Net debt at the end of Q4 stood at $10 billion, a decline of $2 billion year-on-year or 17%. 3M continues to be a reliable and robust cash generator. In addition, the upcoming spin of our Health Care business will further strengthen our balance sheet.\nAs Bruce mentioned, we anticipate receiving a onetime dividend from Solventim at an initial leverage of 3x to 3.5x EBITDA. We will also retain a 19.9% equity stake which will provide additional liquidity. This, combined with our existing strong capital structure provides us with the ability to continue to invest in the business return capital to shareholders and meet the cash flow needs related to ongoing legal matters.\nNow please turn to Slide 10 for a discussion on our business group performance. Starting with our Safety and Industrial business, which posted sales of $2.7 billion, down 3.9% organically. The expected decline in demand for disposable respirators was a headwind of approximately $50 million negatively impacting segment organic growth by 160 basis points. Organic growth was led by a double-digit increase in roofing granules while Industrial adhesives and tapes was flat, while all other businesses declined.\nGeographically, core industrial markets in the United States were relatively strong, while China remained weak. Our businesses were impacted by a reduction in channel inventory towards the end of the quarter, particularly in the Greater China and EMEA regions as channel partners manage cash and are cautious as we enter 2024.\nAdjusted operating income was $524 million, down 6% versus last year. Adjusted operating margins were 19.7%, down 70 basis points year-on-year. This decline was driven by lower sales volumes, which was partially offset by benefits from restructuring, pricing and strong spending discipline.\nMoving to Transportation and Electronics, which posted sales of $1.8 billion or up 2.7% organically. Our auto OEM business continued to perform well and increased 13% versus a 9% increase in global car and light truck builds.\nThe Electronics business was flat organically year-on-year as demand for consumer electronic devices began to stabilize while semiconductor remains soft. We continue to closely monitor these trends and are well positioned to grow with our customers in these large and important end markets.\nLooking at the rest of Transportation and Electronics, Advanced Materials grew organically high single digits. Commercial Solutions grew low single digits and transportation safety declined low single digits. Transportation and Electronics delivered $370 million in adjusted operating income, up 28% year-on-year.\nAdjusted operating margins were 20.9%, up 380 basis points versus Q4 last year. The team achieved this result through restructuring actions, pricing and strong spending discipline.\nTurning to our health care business. Q4 sales were $2 billion or down 1% organically versus last year. Sales in our medical solutions business grew low single digits organically, while separation and purification and oral care were both down low single digits. Health Information Systems organic sales decreased high single digits.\nLooking at the year, our businesses within Health Care continue to see lingering COVID-related impacts. Full year organic growth in health care was approximately 1% with both Medical Solutions and Oral Care posting positive low single-digit growth, while health information systems and separation and purification were both down low single digits.\nHealth Care's fourth quarter operating income was $372 million, down 10% year-on-year. Operating margins were 18.3% or down 1.9 percentage points with adjusted EBITDA margins of 26%. Year-on-year adjusted operating margins were impacted by lower sales volumes, along with added costs associated with the pending spin.\nLastly, the Consumer business posted fourth quarter sales of $1.2 billion. Organic sales declined 2.2% year-on-year. Home improvement increased low single digits organically, while home health and auto declined low single digits and stationery and office declined high single digits.\nGeographically, organic growth was down slightly in the U.S. while EMEA was down mid-single digits and Asia Pacific declined low double digits. Consumers fourth quarter operating income was $221 million, up 4% compared to last year with operating margins of 18%, up 100 basis points year-on-year. The improvement in operating margins was driven by benefits from restructuring actions, portfolio optimization strong spending discipline and productivity actions.\nBefore I turn it back to Mike for him to discuss outlook for 2024, I wanted to take a moment to reflect on our 2023 total company performance. As the year progressed, we made strong improvements in adjusted operating margins. For reference, Slide 23 in the appendix provides our quarterly adjusted operating margin recon for the year. As you can see, we delivered significant improvement in performance, particularly when setting aside the impact from restructuring charges.\nPlease turn to Slide 12, and I will now turn the call back over to Mike. Mike?\n\nMichael F. Roman\n\nnullChairman & Chief Executive Officer\n\nThank you, Monish. We are entering 2024 with strong momentum from our strategic priorities as we build on the actions taken in 2023. We will remain focused on improving operational performance as we progress our restructuring while driving even greater supply chain productivity and inventory reductions. These represent significant opportunities to deliver sustainable margin and cash flow expansion in 2024.\nWe will also further accelerate efforts to optimize our portfolio, which has been an ongoing strategy for 3M. In addition to finalizing the health care spin, we will continue implementing our geographic prioritization strategy.\nWe will also step up our efforts to prioritize our product portfolios based on market potential, right to win, supply chain complexity, margins and returns. For example, in our consumer business, we have identified approximately 5% of the portfolio where we have limited market growth and a poor right to win.\nWhile exiting these portfolios will impact consumers' growth rate in the near term, these actions will better focus our efforts on products that best utilize 3M invention and ultimately drive improved growth and margins in the long term.\nAt the same time, 3M succeeds across market cycles because we remain close to customers and invest in innovation. We will continue to invest in R&D and capital expenditures, enabling us to win in our core and also in new attractive markets where 3M can make a difference.\nFinally, we will stay focused on reducing risk and uncertainty by proactively and effectively managing litigation, including finalizing legal settlements. We will advance the ramp down of PFAS manufacturing while continuing to make progress on our sustainability goals. In 2024, for example, we expect to complete the investments in state-of-the-art water filtration technology across our chemical manufacturing sites.\nPlease turn to Slide 13. Based on these focus areas, along with the macroeconomic outlook, we are laying out our guidance for 2024. We expect the execution of our priorities to support the strengthening of our competitive position, continued underlying margin improvement and strong cash flows as we aggressively manage working capital. As we start 2024, the macro environment remains muted, similar to what we saw in the fourth quarter.\nOn an adjusted basis, we anticipate organic full year growth of flat to plus 2%. Excluding the impact from geographic prioritization and portfolio actions, we expect organic growth of 1% to 3%. With respect to EPS, we anticipate earnings of $9.35 to $9.75 per share. We expect continued strong margin expansion, along with another year of strong cash flow with an adjusted conversion rate of 95% to 105%.\nAs Bruce noted, following the completion of the health care spin, we will host an investor meeting and provide strategic updates along with updated guidance for 3M. As always, underpinning our success will be the strengths of 3M, our industry-leading material science, advanced manufacturing global capabilities and iconic brands, along with some of the best and brightest people around the world.\nBefore I turn it back to Monish, let me repeat a few important points. As I look across 3M, a 2023 was a pivotal year for our enterprise. We executed our plans and delivered on our commitment to exit the year stronger, leaner and more focused.\nWe improved our operational performance advance the spin-off of Solventum and address risk and uncertainty. I am proud of everything we accomplished in 2023, and equally excited about the year ahead. We are in excellent position to build on our progress continue to improve our operational performance and deliver another successful year.\nI thank all 3Mers for their dedication and for everything they do for our company. I will now turn it over to Monish for more details on our guidance. Monish?\n\nMonish D. Patolawala\n\nSenior VP & CFO, 3M Company\n\nThanks, Mike. Please turn to Slide 14. As Mike highlighted, we expect another year of strong execution on our priorities, including strengthening our competitive position, continued margin improvement and robust cash flows as we aggressively manage working capital.\nLet's now look at our 2024 expected performance for our business segments. Starting with Safety and Industrial, where we estimate organic sales growth to be flat to up low single digits. As we start the year, we continue to see demand in industrial end markets remaining mixed.\nFull year 2024, industrial production is currently expected to be at approximately 2% worldwide with the U.S. being flat. This business is not only impacted by general industrial manufacturing but also production activity in automotive and electronics end markets, which I will cover next with my comments on transportation and electronics.\nAdjusted organic sales growth for Transportation and Electronics is forecasted to be flat to up low single digits organically. This range excludes the impact of the exit of PFAS manufacturing. Consumer electronics end markets are expected to be up slightly year-on-year as the market works to turn the corner.\nThe semiconductor market is forecasted to start the year soft, however, improve as we progress through the year. Automotive unit volume production is forecast to be down slightly year-on-year. Despite this forecast, we continue to see significant opportunities in the automotive sector through our offerings in both electric vehicle and internal combustion engine vehicles.\nHealthcare's organic sales growth is anticipated to be flat to up low single digits year-on-year. Brian and his team are excited to lead this great business and we'll be providing more details on 2024 and beyond as we progress towards the spin.\nTurning to consumer. Organic sales are expected to be down low single digits as discretionary spending is expected to remain muted, especially in the U.S., along with our ongoing portfolio optimization initiatives. As Mike mentioned, these actions are estimated to create a year-on-year organic growth headwind of approximately $100 million or 2 percentage points.\nAs you create your models for 2024, I want to highlight some important items. We anticipate pretax restructuring charges in the range of $250 million to $350 million and incremental savings in the range of $150 million to $250 million.\nAs I've previously mentioned, our savings are net of the necessary costs required to provide sustained benefits from our restructuring. For example, this includes structure necessary to enhance our go-to-market models, automate processes and continued investment in cybersecurity.\nAdditionally, the restructuring actions have helped to partially reduce stranded costs associated with the pending spin of health care. Overall, our restructuring program remains on track to deliver pretax savings in the range of $700 million to $900 million with a similar level of charges upon completion. We anticipate our actions will be largely done by the end of 2024, with benefits carrying into 2025.\nMoving to pension expense. We estimate a nonoperating pension headwind of approximately $100 million in 2024 or a negative $0.15 per share. This headwind is primarily due to the updating of assumptions, including mortality, along with the amortization of prior period losses.\nWhile we will have an earnings headwind in 2024, it is important to note that our global plans are well funded, ending 2023 at 94%. Net interest expense is anticipated to be a small year-on-year benefit of approximately $0.03 per share. Again, this excludes the pending impact of the health care spin and legal settlements that Bruce mentioned at the start of the call.\nOur adjusted tax rate is expected to be between 18.5% and 19.5% for 2024. This compares to our adjusted tax rate of 17.5% in 2023, resulting in a year-on-year headwind of approximately $0.17 per share at the midpoint. Therefore, the net impact of these below-the-line items is forecasted to result in an earnings headwind of approximately $0.29 per share. This combined headwind is included in our full year 2024 adjusted earnings range guidance of $9.35 to $9.75 that Mike mentioned.\nPlease turn to Slide 15. Before we go to Q&A, let me briefly cover our thoughts on the first quarter. As we look at the first quarter, we see our adjusted sales being approximately $7.6 billion or down slightly versus last year. This forecast factors in an expectation for similar macroeconomic trends that we saw in Q4. It also includes an approximate $100 million year-on-year sales headwind in from geographic prioritization and consumer portfolio initiatives, along with the impact of last year's disposable respirator comp.\nTurning to earnings. We expect first quarter adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $2 to $2.15 per share. This expectation reflects adjusted operating margins in the range of 19.5% to 20%. We -- this range includes continued standup costs related to this pending spin of health care, along with over 100 basis points impact from restructuring and related charges.\nExcluding restructuring charges, adjusted operating margins are forecasted to increase by over 250 basis points year-on-year. In the first quarter, non-op pension will be a $0.04 per share headwind to adjusted earnings. And finally, we expect our adjusted tax rate in the first quarter to be in the range of 20% to 21%.\nIn closing, I would like to emphasize a few things. We remain focused on our priorities and the team continues to drive results through strong operational execution. Our decisive actions in 2023 set the foundation for a strong 2024. As you know, there are many important milestones in the coming months, including completing the spin of health care.\nAnd finally, as a reminder, if you are creating financial models for 3M post-spin, please keep in mind that simply removing the health care business from Total 3M financials will not equal 3M post-spin. There are other factors such as transition service agreements, stranded costs below the line changes that need to be taken into account. As mentioned, once the spin is complete, we will hold an investor meeting and provide an update on our outlook for 2024 that incorporates these factors.\nIn summary, we are building on our momentum and driving sustainable operating improvements that will drive improved financial performance. I want to thank the 3M team for their dedication and focus as they continue to deliver for our customers and shareholders.\nThat concludes my remarks. We will now take your questions.",

Welcome to the A. O. Smith's Fourth Quarter 2023. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Helen Gurholt. Please go ahead.\n\nHelen E. Gurholt\n\nVP of IR and Financial Planning & Analysis, A. O. Smith Corporation\n\nThank you, Abigail. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the A.O. Smith's Full Year and Fourth Quarter Conference Call. I'm Helen Gurholt, Vice President, Investor Relations and Financial Planning and Analysis. Joining me today are Kevin Wheeler, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Chuck Lauber, Chief Financial Officer.\nIn order to provide improved transparency into the operating results of our business, we provided non-GAAP measures. Free cash flow is defined as cash from operations less capital expenditures, adjusted earnings, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted segment earnings and adjusted corporate expenses exclude the impact of restructuring and impairment expenses, nonoperating noncash pension income and expenses as well as legal judgment income and terminated acquisition-related expenses. Reconciliations from GAAP measures to non-GAAP measures are provided in the appendix at the end of this presentation and on our website.\nA friendly reminder that some of our comments and answers during this conference call will be forward-looking statements that are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include matters that we described in this morning's press release, among others. Also, as a courtesy to others in the question queue, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up for churn. If you have multiple questions, please rejoin the queue. We will be using slides as we move through today's call. You can access them on our website at investor.aosmith.com.\nI will now turn the call over to Kevin to begin our prepared remarks. Please turn to the next slide.\n\nKevin J. Wheeler\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, A. O. Smith Corp.\n\nThank you, Helen, and good morning, everyone. I'm on Slide 4 and our full year results. 2023 was a record-setting sales and earnings year driven by resilient water heater demand and excellent execution by our team. North America sales increased 4% and adjusted segment margin increased 310 basis points due to higher water heater volumes and improved price cost relationship. Our Rest of World segment sales grew 4% in local currency as our recently introduced kitchen products in China were well received by the market.\nIn India, our sales grew 15% local currency in 2023 and benefited from sales of new products, which represented 30% of our sales. Free cash flow grew to $598 million, primarily driven by record profit. We returned $490 million of capital to shareholders with our dividend and share repurchases.\nPlease turn to Slide 5. Our global A. O. Smith team delivered record sales of $3.9 billion in 2023 and adjusted EPS of $3.81, a 21% increase over 2022. North America water heater sales grew 6% in 2023 due to strong demand for our residential and commercial water heater products. The residential unit industry demand increased approximately 6% compared to 2022, as new construction and proactive replacement demand remain resilient. Commercial industry units increased approximately 15% year-over-year as volume of commercial electric water heaters greater than 55 gallons rebounded and aligned closer to pre-2022 levels.\nWe are pleased with our market share strength in both residential and commercial water heaters. Our North America boiler sales decreased 12% against a difficult comp of 28% growth in 2022. We worked down our backlog in 2022 after making significant production and supply chain improvements, which led to elevated channel inventories going into 2023. The resulting channel inventory destocking impacted our residential and small commercial boiler sales. Sales of our CREST commercial boilers with Hellcat technology increased over 50% in 2023.\nNorth America water treatment sales grew 2% in 2023 as higher sales and the e-commerce and direct-to-consumer channels were partially offset by lower sales in the wholesale and retail channels. Sales in the prior year benefited from strong shipments as supply chain constraints improved, and we worked down our order backlog, which resulted in elevated channel inventories in early 2023. In China, full year sales increased 4% in local currency. We are pleased with our performance in a continued weak economy. In addition to the successful launch of our kitchen products, we saw double-digit sales growth of our HVAC and commercial water treatment product categories.\nOur core water heating and water treating products also performed well as replacement approaches of residential water heater sales and residential water treatment sales, particularly consumables, remain resilient.\nI'll now turn the call over to Chuck, who will provide more details on our full year and fourth quarter performance.\n\nCharles T. Lauber\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, A. O. Smith Corp.\n\nThank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I'm on Slide 6. Full year sales in the North America segment rose to $2.9 billion, a 4% increase compared with 2022. Higher volumes of water heaters were partially offset by lower sales of boilers and pricing. North America segment earnings of $726 million increased 19% compared with 2022. Adjusted segment margin was 24.8%, an increase of 310 basis points year-over-year. The higher adjusted segment earnings and adjusted segment margin were primarily driven by higher water heater volumes and lower material costs.\nMoving to Slide 7. Rest of the World segment sales of $957 million decreased 1% year-over-year, including unfavorable currency translation of $44 million, primarily related to China. Segment sales increased 4% on a constant currency basis. Our sales increase was primarily driven by higher sales of kitchen products and water treatment products in China. India sales grew 15% in local currency in 2023, which is approximately 3x the market. Rest of the World segment earnings of $99 million increased 3% compared to segment earnings in 2022, primarily due to higher sales in China. Adjusted segment operating margin was 10.4%, an increase of 40 basis points compared to 2022.\nPlease turn to Slide 8. Turning to fourth quarter performance, we delivered sales of $988 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, an increase of 6% year-over-year, led by higher water heater volumes in North America and higher kitchen product sales in China that more than offset lower boiler sales and pricing. Adjusted earnings in the fourth quarter were $0.97 per share compared with adjusted earnings of $0.86 per share in the fourth quarter of 2022.\nPlease turn to Slide 9. Fourth quarter sales in the North America segment were $738 million, a 7% increase compared to sales in the fourth quarter of 2022, as a result of higher water heating volumes partially offset by lower boiler sales. North America segment adjusted earnings of $173 million increased 8% compared to 2022. Adjusted operating margin of 23.5% increased 20 basis points compared to last year. The higher adjusted segment earnings and adjusted segment margin were primarily due to higher water heater volumes.\nMoving on to Slide 10. Fourth quarter Rest of the World segment sales of $260 million increased 4% year-over-year primarily driven by sales of new products, partially offset by unfavorable currency translation of $3 million in China. India sales grew 11% in local currency in 2023, compared to 2022. Rest of the World adjusted segment earnings of $30 million decreased 6% compared to Q4 2022 segment earnings. An adjusted segment margin of 11.5% decreased 120 basis points compared to segment margin in the same period last year. The decreases were primarily due to promotions and advertising supporting the launch of our dishwasher and steam oven products in China.\nPlease turn to Slide 11. We generated free cash flow of $598 million during 2023, an increase of 86% over 2022, primarily driven by higher earnings and lower working capital [ lens ]. 2023 free cash flow conversion was 107%. Our cash balance totaled $363 million at the end of December our net cash position was $236 million. Our leverage ratio was 6.5% as measured by total debt to total capital.\nNow I'll turn to Slide 12. As we detailed at our Investor Day, in addition to returning capital to shareholders, we continue to see opportunities for organic growth, innovation and new product development across all of our product lines and geographies. We target strategic acquisitions that meet our financial metrics of accretive to earnings in the first year and return our cost of capital in 3 years. The strength of our balance sheet allows us to continue to invest in ourselves through research and development and capital expansion while pursuing strategic acquisitions.\nEarlier this month, our Board approved our next quarterly dividend of $0.32 per share. We have increased our dividend for over 30 consecutive years. We repurchased approximately 4.4 million shares of common stock in 2023 for a total of $307 million. We continue our strong track record of delivering return to shareholders. Over the last 2 years, we have returned over $1 billion to shareholders through our dividends and share repurchases.\nPlease turn to Slide 13 and our 2024 earnings guidance and outlook. We are pleased to introduce our 2024 outlook with an expected EPS range of $3.90 and $4.15 per share. The midpoint of our EPS range represents an increase of 6% compared with 2023 adjusted EPS. Our outlook is based on a number of key assumptions, including our guidance assumes that steel prices in 2024 will be a slight headwind compared to 2023. Relative to current steel prices, our projection includes a decline in steel price index in the second half of the year.\nOur outlook assumes non-steel material costs are similar in 2024, as they were in 2023. Our guidance also assumes a relatively stable supply chain environment, similar to what we experienced throughout 2023. We are monitoring the situation in the Red Sea and Panama down and currently have not experienced any negative impacts. We launched our internally designed and manufactured gas tankless products earlier this month, as we mentioned at our Investor Day, these products will be manufactured in our China facility until our North America capacity is completed in 2025. Associated import tariffs and other launch costs will impact North America margins by approximately 50 basis points. We are investing in manufacturing in Juarez, Mexico that would eliminate the tariff in the future.\nFor the year, CapEx should be between $105 million to $115 million. an increase over the last several years due to capacity expansion projects related to our gas tankless manufacturing facility [ 4x ], the expansion of our engineering capabilities in Lebanon, Tennessee and an increase in high-efficiency commercial water heating manufacturing capacity to align with regulatory changes coming in 2026. We expect to generate strong free cash flow of between $525 million and $575 million. Corporate and other expenses are expected to be approximately $60 million.\nOur effective tax rate is estimated to be between 24% and 24.5%. And we expect to repurchase $300 million of shares of our stock, resulting in our outstanding diluted shares of $147 million at the end of 2024.\nI'll now turn the call back over to Kevin who will provide more color on our key markets and top line growth outlook and segment expectations for 2024, staying on Slide 13. Kevin?\n\nKevin J. Wheeler\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, A. O. Smith Corp.\n\nThank you, Chuck. We project 2024 sales will grow between 3% and 5% compared to 2023, which includes the following assumptions. We believe the U.S. new home construction remains in a deficit, we project it will be flat in 2023. We also assume that 2024 proactive replacement will remain at a level similar to 2023. Therefore, after an approximate 6% increase in the industry in 2023 compared to 2022, we project that 2024 residential industry unit volumes will be approximately flat to last year. We project U.S. commercial water heater industry volumes to increase low single digits as demand for our commercial electric greater than 55 gallons continues its positive trend to pre-2022 levels.\nIn addition, our outlook includes the announced price increases in North America water heating up 4% on most of our water heater products. Price increase for heat pump products is 8%. These increases are projected to be effective late in the first quarter. In China, we believe it will take time for the economy to improve amid weakened consumer confidence in a challenged real estate and housing market, and we have not yet seen signs of significant improvement. Even with the continued backdrop of a weak economy, we project our sales in China will again grow 3% to 5%, and local currency in 2024, driven by resilient replacement demand, growth in demand for our water treatment products and our recently released kitchen products.\nOur forecast assumes that the currency translation impact will be minimal in 2024. We expect to return to growth in our North America boiler business with a projected sales increase of between 8% to 10% in 2024. We expect to continue to benefit from the transition to higher energy efficient boilers, particularly as commercial buildings look to improve their overall carbon footprint. We predict sales of North America water treatment products to increase approximately 10% to 12% as we expect to grow at 2x the pace of the market. Based on our 2024 assumptions, we expect our North America segment margin to be between 24.5% and 25%, and Rest of World segment margins to be approximately 10%.\nPlease turn to Slide 14. I'd like to thank everyone who joined us at our Investor Day late last year, either in person or via webcast. A recording of the webcast is available on our website. The team and I enjoyed sharing the exciting growth opportunities that we see on the horizon for all of our businesses. A summary of the key topics that we cover are on Slide 14. I look forward to sharing periodic updates on our initiatives including the launch of our gas tankless products.\nAs we look to 2024, we remain focused on our key strategic priorities to advance our position as a leader in heating and treating water around the world. Those priorities are: expand and enhance our high-efficiency product portfolio, including heat pumps for space and water heating, expand our global water treatment capabilities by investing in technologies, people and geographic expansion and deploy capital effectively by investing in ourselves, pursue our active acquisition pipeline and returning capital to shareholders.\nWe have many reasons to be have optimism as we enter 2024. We see strong end market demand in North America for all of our product categories, and we expect to return to growth for boilers and North America water treatment as we believe our customers exited 2024 and 2023 with normalized channel inventories. We have begun several capacity expansion projects in North America that will support our growth in the long term. In China, we are projecting a second year of growth driven by innovative new products and resilient demand for our core products. And we expect to continue double-digit growth in India as our premium products and customer service are well received in the market.\nAnd finally, this year marks an important milestone for A. O. Smith, as we celebrate our 150th anniversary. What began as a small machine shop in Milwaukee, Wisconsin in 1874 and has grown into an innovative, industry-leading global water technology company with more than 12,000 employees. A. O. Smith has a rich and proud history, and we are excited to celebrate it with employees, shareholders, customers and partners across the globe.\nWith that, we conclude our prepared remarks, and we are now available for your questions.",

Welcome to the 3M Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Tuesday, October 24, 2023. I would now like to turn the call over to Bruce Jermeland, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at 3M.\n\nBruce Jermeland\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter earnings conference call. With me today are Mike Roman, 3M's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Monish Patolawala, our President and Chief Financial Officer. Mike and Monish will make some formal comments, and then we'll take your questions. Please note that today's earnings release and slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on the homepage of our Investor Relations website at 3m.com.\nPlease turn to Slide 2. Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement. During today's conference call, we'll be making certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M's future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-Q lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions.\nPlease note throughout today's presentation, we'll be making references to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures can be found in the attachments to today's press release. With that, please turn to Slide 3, and I'll now hand the call off to Mike. Mike?\n\nMichael F. Roman\n\nnullChairman & Chief Executive Officer\n\nThank you, Bruce. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. In the third quarter, we built momentum through strong operational execution as we again delivered for our customers positioning us for a solid close to 2023. On an adjusted basis, we delivered earnings ahead of our expectations, expanded margins sequentially across all 4 businesses and achieved our third consecutive quarter of double-digit year-on-year growth and free cash flow.\nAs we make progress and deliver improved financial results, we are increasing our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance to $8.95 to $9.15, up from a previous range of $8.60 to $9.10. And our adjusted free cash flow conversion range to 100% to 110%, up from 90% to 100% previously. We continue to deliver against our priorities. We are driving performance throughout 3M with strong operational execution, restructuring actions and spending discipline.\nWe are progressing the spin of the health care business, which we expect to be completed during the first half of 2024. And we are reducing risk and uncertainty by reaching significant settlements to address Combat Arms and PFAS litigation. I will now provide some additional context around how we are advancing these priorities.\nNext slide, please. Our margin expansion clearly demonstrates the performance our team is driving throughout 3M. We delivered 240 basis points of year-over-year adjusted operating income margin expansion excluding 80 basis points of restructuring-related charges. We are strengthening our business in several important ways. We are progressing with our restructuring actions to streamline our organization, reduce structural costs and get us closer to customers. We have leaned out the center of our company, simplified our global supply chain organization and optimized our global go-to-market models.\nAt the same time, we are advancing supply chain performance to improve service, drive productivity and yield, expand gross margins and increase cash conversion. These results are being supported by initiatives that use our continuous improvement toolkit and leverage data and data analytics. For example, we have benefited from more than 60 Kaizen events this year to improve existing processes in our largest plants. We are also progressing the spin of our health care business, building the leadership team as we work toward completing the spin in the first half of 2024.\nDuring the quarter, we added 2 experienced leaders, naming Bryan Hanson as the CEO of the stand-alone health care business and Carrie Cox as the Board Chair. Finally, we continue to manage risk and uncertainty by proactively and effectively managing litigation. We announced the Combat Arm Settlement and we are working with all parties and the courts to implement it. The settlement administration process has been established and funded. The bellwether trial verdicts have been settled, and the process for notifying and settling with claimants has begun.\nWith respect to PFAS, the public water supplier settlement we announced last quarter has received preliminary court approval. We successfully resolved objections from state attorneys general and are working toward approval with the final hearing set for early February next year. In closing, I want to share a few thoughts about our future. Our momentum accelerates our ability to define where we go next at 3M as we prioritize attractive markets where we have the right to win and the opportunity to differentiate ourselves through our unique capabilities and strengths.\nA good example is our automotive OEM business where we continue to outperform the market with double-digit growth this quarter. Auto electrification is on track to be a $600 million business this year and has delivered organic growth of 30% year-to-date. Our material science expertise has led us to build a new business and we see similar opportunities in other core platforms such as safety, home improvement and consumer electronics.\nWe are also prioritizing emerging global trends that have attractive growth rates and customer needs that match up well with 3M capabilities. We are building new platforms in areas like climate technology, industrial automation and next-generation electronics. Before I hand it over to Monish for additional insight into our performance, a few closing thoughts. I am pleased with the way our teams are executing. They delivered third quarter results that build on the momentum we saw in the second quarter, setting us up for a solid close to 2023. We are advancing our priorities, driving performance, progressing our health care spend and reducing risk and uncertainty. 3M is delivering today lower cost, better margins and greater cash generation and building for tomorrow prioritizing growth platforms, innovating with impact and empowering our teams. I will now turn it over to Monish for more details on the third quarter and our outlook for the rest of the year. Monish.\n\nMonish D. Patolawala\n\nSenior VP & CFO, 3M Company\n\nThank you, Mike, and I wish you all a very good morning. Please turn to Slide 5. As Mike mentioned, we are seeing significant traction from the actions we are taking to strengthen the business. Through our focus on customers, effective adjustment of production, benefits from efficiency and productivity initiatives, ongoing proactive spending discipline and the relentless focus on managing inventory, we were able to deliver solid adjusted third quarter results, including sales of $8 billion at the high end of our guidance range of $7.9 billion to $8 billion. Operating margins of 23.2%, an increase of 160 basis points year-on-year and 390 basis points sequentially. Earnings per share of $2.68, a year-on-year increase of 3% and free cash flow of $1.9 billion, up 39% year-on-year with conversion of 130%. Organic sales on an adjusted basis declined 3.1% versus last year. This included an expected year-on-year headwind of approximately $140 million, 1.7 percentage points related to lower disposable respirator demand and last year's exit of our operations in Russia. .\nExcluding this, Q3 adjusted organic sales were down 1.4%. Consumer and electronics end markets continue to be soft. Our adjusted organic sales declined year-on-year mid-single digits in our electronics business and high single digits in consumer. This softness was partially offset by strength in our automotive OEM business. Regionally, the U.S. was up slightly despite continued challenges in retail. Europe remains soft, and China was down mid-teens year-on-year organically due to continued end market softness along with lapping strong sales backlog recovery in the prior year.\nOur strong adjusted EPS of $2.68, exceeded our expectations of $2.25 to $2.40. Roughly 2/3 of the beat was driven by operational execution in our supply chain and proactive spending discipline, and the balance driven by restructuring timing. The restructuring actions we announced earlier this year are largely on track, and we are seeing favorable margin impact in our results. We continue to expect full year pretax restructuring benefits of $400 million to $450 million with offsetting charges.\nTurning to Slide 6 for the components that drove our year-on-year operating margin and earnings performance. Manufacturing productivity and restructuring actions, strong spending discipline and selling prices, partially offset by lower sales volumes, investments in the business and the previously mentioned headwinds from disposable respirator and last year's exit of Russia resulted an improvement to operating margins of 260 basis points and to earnings of $0.22 per share.\nPretax restructuring and related charges in the quarter were $68 million or a negative impact to margins of 80 basis points and $0.10 to earnings. This charge was lower than our anticipated range of $125 million to $175 million in Q3 due to factors that impacted the timing of actions that are being pushed into Q4. The carryover impact of higher raw material logistics and energy cost inflation created a year-on-year headwind of approximately $25 million or a negative 30 basis points impact to operating margins and $0.03 to earnings.\nForeign currency translation was a positive 0.6% impact to total adjusted sales. This resulted in a $0.01 tailwind to earnings per share. Last year's food safety divestiture and the reconsolidation of Aearo Technologies resulted in a net year-on-year tailwind of 10 basis points to margins and no impact to earnings. Finally, other financial items decreased earnings by a net $0.02 per share year-on-year.\nIn summary, our team's focus on driving productivity, executing restructuring actions and controlling spending continues to yield results. These actions drove meaningful year-on-year and sequential improvement in adjusted operating margins. Please turn to Slide 7. Third quarter adjusted free cash flow was $1.9 billion, up 39% year-on-year with a conversion of 130%, up 360 basis points versus last year's Q3. This year-on-year improvement was driven by our ongoing focus on working capital management, especially inventory.\nInventory was down over $200 million sequentially and $550 million year-on-year as we benefit from the power of daily management and data and data analytics to speed up inventory terms. As always, there is more we can do and will do to continue to realize benefits from our actions as we move forward. Adjusted capital expenditures were $367 million in the quarter, as we continue to invest in growth, productivity and sustainability.\nDuring the quarter, we returned $828 million to shareholders via dividends. Net debt at the end of Q3 stood at $10.8 billion, a reduction of 11% year-on-year. Our business segments continue their long history of robust cash flow generation. In addition, our proven access to capital markets, along with the anticipated onetime dividend from the spin of health care at leverage of 3x to 3.5x EBITDA and 19.9% retained stake will provide additional financial flexibility.\nThis combined with our existing strong capital structure provides us with the ability to continue to invest in the business, return capital to shareholders and meet the cash flow needs related to ongoing legal matters. Now please turn to Slide 9 for our business group performance.\nStarting with our Safety and Industrial business, which posted sales of $2.8 billion or down 5.8% organically. This result included a year-on-year headwind of approximately $130 million or 4.3 percentage points due to last year's COVID-related disposable respirator decline and exit of our operations in Russia. Excluding this, Q3 adjusted organic sales were down 1.5%. Personal safety was down high single digits due to last year's COVID-related disposable respirator comp. Excluding disposable respirators, personal safety was up high single digits organically.\nClosure and masking continued to be impacted by lower packaging and shipping activity and industrial adhesives and tapes by end market softness in electronics. Abrasives, electrical markets and automotive aftermarket declined versus last year's strong comparisons. And finally, organic growth in our roofing granules business was up high single digits. Adjusted operating income was $708 million or up 5% versus last year. Adjusted operating margins were 25.7%, up 250 basis points year-on-year and up 350 basis points sequentially.\nThe year-on-year improvement in margins was mainly driven by ongoing productivity actions, restructuring benefits, strong spending discipline and price. Partially offsetting these benefits were headwinds from lower sales volume and restructuring costs. Moving to Transportation and Electronics on Slide 10, which posted Q3 adjusted sales of $1.9 billion. Adjusted organic growth declined 1.8% year-on-year, largely due to expected weakness in electronics.\nOur electronics business experienced a year-on-year mid-single-digit decline in adjusted organic sales as semiconductor and data center end market demand continues to remain soft. We are starting to see signs of stabilization in consumer electronics end market. However, we are closely monitoring demand trends as we head into the upcoming holiday season. Our auto OEM business had a strong quarter, increasing approximately 16% year-on-year versus a low single-digit global car and light truck build, as we continue to gain penetration on automotive platforms.\nTurning to the rest of Transportation and Electronics. Commercial solutions and transportation safety both declined mid-single digits year-on-year, mainly driven by weakness in China, while Advanced Materials grew low single digits. Transportation and Electronics delivered $494 million in adjusted operating income, up 21% year-on-year. Adjusted operating margins were 26.3%, up 460 basis points year-on-year and up 650 basis points sequentially.\nThe year-on-year improvement in margins was driven by productivity actions, restructuring benefits, strong spending discipline and price. Partially offsetting these benefits were headwinds from lower sales volumes and restructuring costs. Looking at our health care business on Slide 11. Q3 sales were $2.1 billion, with organic growth up 2.4% versus last year. Organic sales in oral care were up high single digits year-on-year and medical solutions grew grew low single digits organically, including continued impact from lower post-COVID-related biopharma demand. Health Information Systems declined low single digits due to tighter hospital budgets.\nAs procedure volumes continue to improve and hospital budgets stabilize, we are confident in the long-term outlook of this business. Health Care's third quarter operating income was $460 million or up 2% year-on-year. Operating margins were 22.2%, up 50 basis points year-on-year and up sequentially 240 basis points. The year-on-year improvement in margins was driven by productivity actions, restructuring benefits strong spending discipline and price.\nThese benefits were partially offset by restructuring costs. Finally, on Slide 12. Our Consumer business posted third quarter sales of $1.3 billion. Organic sales declined 7.2% year-on-year as discretionary spending trends on hardline categories remains subdued. The back-to-school season was soft and rising interest rates continue to impact the housing market and related spending.\nConsumers third quarter operating income was $269 million, down 10% compared to last year with operating margins of 20.5%, down 70 basis points year-on-year, however, were up 230 basis points sequentially. The year-on-year decline in margins was driven by headwinds from lower sales volumes and restructuring costs. These headwinds were partially offset by benefits from productivity actions, restructuring and strong spending discipline and price.\nThat concludes our remarks on the third quarter. Please turn to Slide 14 for an update on our full year's expectations. Our strong third quarter performance shows the results of the significant actions we have put in place this year to generate better productivity yield and efficiency from our supply chain, drive simplification, manage costs and deliver for our customers in an uncertain macro environment.\nAs a result, we are raising our full year 2023 adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow conversion guidance. We now expect full year adjusted earnings in the range of $8.95 to $9.15 versus our prior range of $8.60 to $9.10. We are also updating our full year adjusted free cash flow conversion to be in a forecasted range of 100% to 110% versus 90% to 100% previously. Based on our year-to-date performance, we expect full year adjusted organic growth to be down approximately 3% versus our prior guidance to be at the lower end of flat to minus 3%. This updated expectation includes an incremental headwind of $50 million from continued softness in disposable respirator demand. We now estimate a full year sales decline for disposable respirators of approximately $600 million versus $550 million previously. Looking ahead to the implied fourth quarter, we expect end market trends to be consistent with Q3.\nHence, we anticipate fourth quarter adjusted sales to be in the range of $7.6 billion to $7.7 billion, taking into consideration normal seasonality with fewer sales days due to holidays. Fourth quarter pretax restructuring charges are expected to be in the range of $70 million to $120 million, incorporating the timing impact I mentioned earlier, with pretax benefits of $145 million to $195 million. Taken together, we expect fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share will be in the range of $2.13 to $2.33.\nTo wrap up, we are very focused on our priorities by driving improved performance through strong operational execution, progressing on our restructuring actions and spending discipline successfully spinning off health care and reducing risk by managing litigation exposures. At the same time, we are positioning 3M for the future as we prioritize the most attractive markets, invest to support continued innovation and capitalize on emerging opportunities. We expect our actions will continue to build momentum and drive long-term improvement in our organic growth margins and cash flow performance into the future.\nAs we exit 2023, we will be a stronger, leaner and a more focused 3M, and I remain confident in our future. Our solid third quarter is a direct result of the hard work of 3M employees. I want to thank them for their dedication and focus as they continue to deliver in partnership with our suppliers for customers and shareholders. That concludes my remarks. We will now take your questions.",

Welcome to the A.O. Smith Corporation [Technical Difficulty] Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our call, please standby. Good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the A. O. Smith's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the call over to our first speaker for today, Helen Gurholt. Your line is now open.\n\nHelen E. Gurholt\n\nVP of IR and Financial Planning & Analysis, A. O. Smith Corporation\n\nGood morning, and thank you, everyone, for your patience while we dealt with our technical difficulties.\nWelcome to our A.O. Smith's third quarter conference call. I'm Helen Gurholt, Vice President, Investor Relations and Financial Planning and Analysis. Joining me today are Kevin Wheeler, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Chuck Lauber, Chief Financial Officer.\nIn order to provide improved transparency into our operating results of our business, we provided non-GAAP measures. Free cash flow is defined as cash from operations, less capital expenditures. Adjusted earnings, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted segment earnings and adjusted corporate expenses exclude the impact of impairment charges, nonoperating noncash pension income and expenses as well as legal judgment income and terminated acquisition-related expenses. We also provide total segment earnings.\nReconciliations from GAAP measures to non-GAAP measures are provided in the appendix at the end of this presentation on our website.\nA friendly reminder that some of our comments and answers during this conference call will be forward-looking statements that are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include matters that we described in this morning's press release, among others. Also, as a courtesy to those in the question queue, please limit yourself to 1 question and 1 follow-up per turn. If you have multiple questions, please rejoin the queue.\nWe will be using slides as we move through today's call. You can access them on our website at investor.aosmith.com.\nI will now turn the call over to Kevin to begin our prepared remarks. Please turn to the next slide.\n\nKevin J. Wheeler\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, A. O. Smith Corp.\n\nThank you, Helen, and good morning, everyone. I'm on Slide 4, and we'll review a few of our third quarter highlights. I'm very pleased with the execution of our team across all of our businesses to deliver a strong third quarter EPS of $0.90. The performance of our North America segment was particularly strong. We saw resilient demand for our residential water heaters as well as year-over-year improvement in our operating margin. China's new products drove year-over-year improvement as newly introduced kitchen appliance products were well received by the market.\nInnovative new products, combined with our strong brand, drove growth despite a continued challenging economic backdrop. India entered the year introducing a number of new products in both the water heating and water treatment categories and has delivered year-to-date sales growth of 17% in local currency. We also acquired WaterTec, a high-quality Arizona-based water treatment company. This acquisition aligns with our strategic growth aspirations to expand water treatment across the U.S. We welcome WaterTech team to the A. O. Smith family.\nPlease turn to Slide 5. North America water heater sales increased 13% in the third quarter as a result of continued strength in residential water heater demand. As you may recall, sales in the third quarter of last year were negatively impacted by channel inventory destocking of residential water heaters, primarily in the wholesale channel. Our North America boiler sales declined 18% in the third quarter against a difficult comp in 2022. In the third quarter last year, we worked on our backlog after making significant production and supply chain improvements. We believe channel inventories are approaching normal levels.\nDemand for our commercial highest business, convention boilers, particularly our Hellcat Crest boilers, remained steady in the quarter. North America water treatment sales increased 5% in the third quarter of 2023, primarily driven by pricing and e-commerce sales. The quarter also benefited from pricing-related margin improvement. In China, third quarter sales increased 9% local currency compared to the third quarter of 2022, primarily due to our newly introduced dishwasher and steam oven products. The quarter also benefited from higher commercial water treatment sales and positive mix.\nI'm now on Slide 6. We continue to introduce new innovative products in water filtration. I'm pleased to highlight the launch of our new SmartFlow reverse osmosis filtration system under both our A.O. Smith and Aquasana brands. The product takes up less space and features an easy filter replacement process. Our SmartFlow technology features a multistage filtration process that removes up to 99.9% of contaminants, including PFAS, arsenic, microplastics and lead. It also features our innovative and exclusive side stream reverse osmosis technology, making this 1 of the most water-efficient systems in the market. This is 1 example of our commitment to bringing innovative water heating and water treatment treating products to the global market.\nOn November 6, at our Investor Day, each of our businesses will highlight new products that are driving results in the marketplace.\nI'll now turn the call over to Chuck, who will provide more details on our third quarter performance.\n\nCharles T. Lauber\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, A. O. Smith Corp.\n\nThank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I'm on Slide 7. Third quarter sales in the North America segment were $710 million, a 9% increase over the same period last year. The increase was primarily driven by higher residential water heater volumes that were partially offset by lower boiler volumes. North America segment earnings of $170 million increased 28% compared with the adjusted segment earnings in the third quarter of 2022. Operating margin of 23.9% improved 350 basis points compared to adjusted segment operating margin in the third quarter of last year. The higher segment earnings and operating margin were primarily due to higher residential water heater volumes and lower steel costs, partially offset by lower boiler volumes. Segment pricing was relatively flat in the quarter compared to last year.\nMoving on to Slide 8. Rest of the World segment sales of $233 million, increased 1% year-over-year and 6% on a constant currency basis. Currency translation unfavorably impacted segment sales by approximately $11 million. Sales of newly introduced kitchen appliance products, higher commercial water treatment sales and a positive mix in China, drove the sales increase in the quarter. India sales grew 13% in local currency in the third quarter compared to last year. Rest of the World segment earnings of $23 million increased 6% compared to segment earnings in the third quarter of 2022. Segment operating margin was 9.9%, an increase of 40 basis points compared to the same period last year, primarily as a result of higher sales of new products and a positive mix.\nPlease turn to Slide 9. We generated free cash flow of $396 million in the first 9 months of 2023, more than 2x the free cash flow generated in the same period last year. This was largely due to higher earnings and lower working capital cash outlays primarily related to lower inventory levels and lower 2022 incentive payments paid in 2023. Our cash balance totaled $342 million at the end of September, and our net cash position was $212 million. Our leverage ratio was 6.4%, as measured by total debt to total capital. Our free cash flow and solid balance sheet enable us to focus on capital allocation priorities and return of cash to shareholders.\nEarlier this month, our Board approved a 7% increase to our quarterly dividend to $0.32 per share. We repurchased 2.4 million shares of common stock in the first 9 months of 2023 for a total of $161 million. We expect to repurchase $300 million of our shares for the full year 2023.\nLet's now turn to Slide 10. In addition to returning capital to shareholders, we continue to see opportunities for organic growth through innovation and new product development across all of our product lines and geographies. The strength of our balance sheet also allows us to pursue strategic acquisitions along with organic growth.\nPlease turn to Slide 11 and our revised 2023 earnings guidance and outlook. We have increased our 2023 outlook with an expected adjusted earnings per share range of $3.70 to $3.80 per share. The midpoint of our adjusted earnings per share range represents an increase of 19% compared with 2022 adjusted EPS. Our outlook is based on a number of key assumptions, which include a stable supply chain with limited disruption.\nWe have increased our North America full year margin guidance to be approximately 25% based on our full year outlook on volumes and price cost relationship. We forecast that our Q4 material costs will be similar to our Q3 material costs. Our Rest of the World margin guidance of approximately 10% remains unchanged. We expect to generate strong free cash flow of between $575 million and $600 million.\nFor the year, CapEx should be approximately $65 million, corporate and other expenses are expected to be approximately $60 million. Our effective tax rate is estimated to be approximately 24%. And with the expectation to repurchase approximately $300 million of shares of our stock, the resulting average outstanding diluted shares is expected to be 151 million at the end of 2023.\nI'll now turn the call back over to Kevin, who will provide more color on our key markets, top line growth outlook and segment expectations for 2023, staying on Slide 11. Kevin?\n\nKevin J. Wheeler\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, A. O. Smith Corp.\n\nThank you, Chuck. We have narrowed our 2023 sales outlook to grow approximately 2% compared to 2022, which was the high end of our previous guidance. Our outlook includes the following assumptions: Residential water heater orders remained strong through October. Therefore, we project 2023 residential water heater industry volumes will increase approximately 4% compared to last year. We continue to monitor proactive replacement and new housing completions, both of which remain favorable.\nDemand for commercial electric water heaters greater than 55-gallon continue to be robust. Our guidance for commercial water heater industry volumes to increase mid-teens compared to 2022 is unchanged. We maintain our guidance that our sales in China will grow 3% to 5% local currency in 2023. Our forecast assumes that the Chinese currency will devalue approximately 6% in 2023 compared to 2022. Our boiler business outlook of being down high single digits compared to last year is unchanged. As a reminder, 2022 is a difficult comp. We entered last year with a large backlog, which we worked down and exited the year with a normalized backlog partially, partly contributing to our boiler business growth of 28% in 2022.\nOur outlook for North America water treatment sales is to grow approximately 5% to 7% for 2023 also has not changed. We project that our sales in India will grow 15% this year.\nPlease turn to Slide 12. Again, we are very pleased with our performance in the first 9 months of 2023. In North America, residential commercial water heater demand remained strong through the third quarter. The year is lining up to have a normalized split of approximately 52% of volume in the first half of the year and 48% in the back half of the year. As we expected, North America operating margin was down sequentially in the quarter, but remained strong relative to historical performance at 23.9%, even as we recognized higher steel costs in the quarter, compared to the first half of the year.\nIn China, the team continues to execute very well across our various product lines through a balanced go-to-market channel strategy. New product introductions, continued growth in commercial water treatment and positive mix led to a 10% operating margin in the quarter. India continues to outperform the industry. We see great potential for our India business as it continues to deliver growth through new product introductions and premium customer service.\nOur focus remains on taking care of our customers as we continue to execute our key strategic objectives to advance our position as a global water technology leader.\nWith that, we conclude our prepared remarks, and we are now available for your questions.",

Welcome to the 3M second quarter earnings conference call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Tuesday, July 25, 2023.\nI would now like to turn the call over to Bruce Jermeland, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at 3M.\n\nBruce Jermeland\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter earnings conference call. With me today are Mike Roman, 3M's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Monish Patolawala, our Chief Financial and Transformation Officer; and Kevin Rhodes, our Chief Legal Officer. Mike, Kevin and Monish will make some formal comments, then we will take your questions. Please note that today's earnings release and slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on the homepage of our Investor Relations website at 3m.com.\nPlease turn to Slide 2. Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement. During today's conference call, we'll be making certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M's future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions.\nPlease note, throughout today's presentation, we'll be making references to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures can be found in the attachments to today's press release.\nWith that, please turn to Slide 3, and I'll now hand the call off to Mike. Mike?\n\nMichael F. Roman\n\nnullChairman & Chief Executive Officer\n\nThank you, Bruce. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. In the second quarter, we made significant progress on the important actions we have been taking to improve our performance and shape the future of 3M. We posted adjusted organic growth of negative 2.5%, which includes a negative 1.7% headwind from the expected decline in disposable respirator sales. Revenue for the quarter was at the high end of our guidance range.\nOur adjusted operating margin was 19.3%, impacted by restructuring charges of $212 million or a headwind to adjusted operating margin of 2.7 percentage points. Excluding these charges, we increased operating margin year-over-year. We delivered adjusted earnings per share of $2.17 and adjusted free cash flow of $1.5 billion driven by continued improvements in inventory management.\nToday, we are updating our full year earnings per share guidance to $8.60 to $9.10, up from a previous range of $8.50 to $9. We remain confident in our ability to deliver on our commitments, realize additional benefits from our restructuring actions and position 3M for the future.\nIn the quarter, we maintained a strong focus on serving customers, driving operational execution and maintaining spending discipline. All business segments delivered sequential improvement in adjusted operating margins. Our restructuring actions and strong focus on cost management drove these margin improvements.\nLooking at our markets, trends played out as expected. We saw strength in automotive, both OEM and aftermarket, as well as highway infrastructure and personal safety, excluding disposable respirators. Health Care, which was up slightly, continues to be impacted by lower post-COVID-related demand, notably in our Biopharma, Health Information and Medical Solutions businesses. We also saw continued weakness in electronics, consumer retail and China.\nPlease turn to Slide 4. As we focus on improving our performance and managing a dynamic external environment, our teams are driving 3 strategic priorities: improving operational execution, successfully spinning off our Health Care business and addressing litigation.\nWe are on track with our restructuring actions and have made significant progress in leaning out the center of the company, simplifying our management structure and streamlining our supply chain. The changes to our enterprise supply chain organization are enabling improvements in service, cost and inventory, which helped drive our second quarter results. We are also taking advantage of the continued healing and supply chains to reduce logistics costs and improve production yields.\nWe've also made progress in advancing our go-to-market models to bring our innovation closer to customers. In support of these changes, to date, we have initiated the transition to a new export model in 24 countries. I am pleased with how these changes are helping drive performance.\nWe've made good progress on our planned spin of our Health Care business, including regulatory filings and system updates in preparation for soft spin. We are also in the final steps of naming a CEO. We continue to work towards closing the transaction by year-end 2023 or early 2024, subject to the required conditions and additional factors we have disclosed in our SEC filings.\nLast month, we announced an agreement, subject to court approval, to resolve public water systems claims nationwide in the AFFF multi-district litigation. This agreement will benefit U.S.-based public water systems that provide drinking water to a vast majority of Americans. The settlement covers all forms of PFAS. As we announced, we have taken a Q2-related charge of $10.3 billion payable over 13 years. Also related to litigation, we continue to participate in the confidential mediation process as part of the Combat Arms MDL, and we'll provide updates as appropriate.\nTo provide additional details on our PFAS settlement agreement, I will now turn the call over to Kevin. Please turn to Slide 5. Kevin?\n\nKevin H. Rhodes\n\nExecutive VP & Chief Legal Affairs Officer, 3M Company\n\nThank you, Mike, and good morning. This is an important step forward for 3M. As Mike said, we have entered into a broad class resolution with public water systems that provide drinking water to the vast majority of Americans. We are taking a proactive approach to managing PFAS by establishing a more certain path forward for public water systems, communities and 3M.\nSubject to court approval, 3M has agreed to support PFAS remediation for public water systems that detect PFAS at any level, and our agreement addresses all PFAS, not just those compounds that have been the primary focus of litigation to date. Our agreement also provides funding for eligible public water systems that may detect PFAS into the future, and we have agreed to fund additional testing by public water systems as well.\nAs Mike shared, the agreement terms entail a present value commitment of $10.3 billion paid over 13 years. Additional details regarding the payment schedule are available in our Form 8-K filed in June. While this agreement provides an alternative to continued litigation for class members and for 3M, we remain prepared to defend ourselves in litigation should the agreement not receive court approval or should public water systems choose to litigate instead.\nWe are building on actions 3M has taken and continues to take. We were the first company to exit the manufacturing of 2 forms of PFAS, namely PFOA and PFOS, which we announced more than 20 years ago. We have invested in state-of-the-art water filtration technology in our chemical manufacturing operations. And we have announced that 3M will exit all PFAS manufacturing by the end of 2025. We will continue to build on this important progress as we focus on the future and work to proactively manage PFAS.\nNow let me turn it over to Monish to provide more details regarding our performance in the quarter. Monish?\n\nMonish D. Patolawala\n\nSenior VP & CFO, 3M Company\n\nThank you, Kevin, and I wish you all a very good morning. Please turn to Slide 6. Our second quarter performance was driven by continued focus on serving our customers, improving manufacturing and supply chain productivity while also maintaining strong spending discipline. Also, during the quarter, we initiated a large part of our restructuring program to simplify and streamline the organization. We are aggressively reducing management layers and rooftops while also streamlining our go-to-market models and supply chain, bringing us closer to our customers.\nEnd-market trends continue to play out as anticipated with ongoing weakness in electronics, soft discretionary spending patterns in consumer retail and mixed trends in industrial end markets. Regionally, China's recovery has been slow, impacted by electronics and soft export trends. Europe remains challenged as the uncertain geopolitical situation persists, while end markets in the U.S. largely remain steady.\nSecond quarter total adjusted sales were $8 billion or down 4.7% year-on-year. This result was a little better than forecasted as we experienced a smaller-than-anticipated headwind from foreign currency translation of minus 0.9% versus a forecast of minus 2%. On an adjusted basis, organic sales declined 2.5% versus last year. This result included an expected year-on-year headwind of approximately $140 million or 1.7 percentage points related to lower disposable respirator demand. Excluding this impact, Q2 adjusted organic sales declined 0.8%.\nOn an adjusted basis, second quarter operating income was $1.5 billion with operating margins of 19.3% and earnings of $2.17 per share. These results included pretax restructuring charges of $212 million, which negatively impacted adjusted operating margins by 2.7 percentage points and earnings by $0.31 per share. Without the impact of restructuring, second quarter adjusted operating margins were 22% or up 40 basis points versus last year, and earnings were $2.48, up $0.03 year-on-year.\nTurning to other components that impacted results year-on-year. We were able to more than offset the impact of lower sales volumes and inflation impacts through improved manufacturing productivity, benefits from restructuring, strong spending discipline and selling prices while continuing to invest in the business. The net result was an increase to margins of 1.4 percentage points and $0.15 to earnings.\nThe previously mentioned headwind from disposable respirators resulted in a negative impact to operating margins of 50 basis points and to earnings of $0.09 per share. The carryover impact of higher raw material, logistics and energy cost inflation created a year-on-year headwind of approximately $30 million or a negative 30 basis points impact to operating margins and $0.04 to earnings.\nAs mentioned, foreign currency translation was a negative 0.9% impact to total sales. This resulted in a headwind of 20 basis points to margins and $0.02 to earnings per share. Divestitures, primarily Food Safety, did not impact margins but resulted in a year-on-year headwind of $0.03 to earnings per share. Finally, other financial items increased earnings by a net $0.06 per share year-on-year primarily driven by a lower share count, which was partially offset by a lower non-op pension benefit.\nIn summary, our team's focus on driving productivity, executing restructuring actions and controlling spending is starting to yield results. These actions, coupled with improvement in global supply chains, drove sequential improvement in adjusted operating margins across all of our business groups. Excluding restructuring charges, adjusted operating margins improved 3.6 percentage points sequentially.\nPlease turn to Slide 7. Second quarter adjusted free cash flow was approximately $1.5 billion, up 44% year-on-year with conversion of 122%, up 50 percentage points versus last year's Q2. This year-on-year improvement was driven by our ongoing focus on working capital management, especially inventory, and the timing impact related to restructuring charges. Inventory was flat sequentially versus a typical historical build from Q1 to Q2. We continue to adjust production output to end markets and leverage the power of daily management and data and data analytics to increase the velocity of inventory turns.\nAdjusted capital expenditures were $328 million in the quarter or similar year-on-year as we continue to invest in growth, productivity and sustainability. During the quarter, we returned $828 million to shareholders via dividend. Net debt at the end of Q2 stood at $11.7 billion or down 12% year-on-year.\nOur business segments continue their long history of robust cash flow generation. In addition, our proven access to capital markets, along with the anticipated onetime dividend from the spin of Health Care at 3 to 3.5x EBITDA and 19.9% retained stake, will provide additional financial flexibility. This, combined with our existing strong capital structure, provides us the flexibility to continue to invest in the business, return capital to shareholders and meet the cash flow needs related to ongoing legal matters.\nNow please turn to Slide 9 for our business group performance. Starting with our Safety and Industrial business, which posted sales of $2.8 billion or down 4.6% organically. This result included a year-on-year headwind of approximately $140 million or 4.8 percentage points due to last year's COVID-related disposable respirator decline. Excluding disposable respirators, Safety and Industrial sales grew 0.2% organically in Q2.\nOrganic growth was led by mid-single-digit increases in roofing granules and automotive aftermarket, while personal safety declined due to last year's disposable respirator comp. Excluding disposable respirators, personal safety was up high single digits organically.\nClosure and masking declined due to slowdown in packaging and shipping activity, while industrial adhesives and tapes continue to be impacted by end-market softness in electronics. Adjusted operating income was $614 million or down 2.4% versus last year. Adjusted operating margins were 22.2%, up 70 basis points year-on-year and up 2 percentage points sequentially. The year-on-year improvement in margins was driven by productivity actions, strong spending discipline and price. Partially offsetting these benefits were headwinds from lower sales volume, restructuring costs and inflation impacts.\nMoving to Transportation and Electronics on Slide 10, which posted Q2 adjusted sales of $1.9 billion. Adjusted organic growth declined 2.4% year-on-year, largely due to the continued decline in demand for electronics. Our auto OEM business increased approximately 21% year-on-year, approximately 600 basis points higher than global car and light truck builds.\nOur electronics business continues to be impacted by soft end-market demand for electronics. As a result, this business experienced a year-on-year decline in adjusted organic sales of approximately 22%. Electronic end markets continue to remain highly uncertain. We expect our year-on-year organic growth rates in electronics to remain negative in the second half, however, improve versus down nearly 30% in the first half as we start to lap easier comps.\nTurning to the rest of Transportation and Electronics. Transportation safety grew high single digits organically, while commercial [indiscernible] digits year-on-year. Transportation and Electronics delivered $369 million in adjusted operating income, down 19% year-on-year. Adjusted operating margins were 19.8%, down 3.6 percentage points year-on-year, however, increased 3.1 percentage points sequentially. Margin headwinds were driven by sales volume declines, restructuring costs and inflation impacts. These headwinds were partially offset by benefits from strong spending discipline, productivity actions and pricing.\nLooking at our Health Care business on Slide 11. Q2 sales were $2.1 billion with organic growth up slightly versus last year. Organic sales in oral care were up low single digits year-on-year, and Medical Solutions business grew slightly. Separation and purification and Health Information Systems declined mid-single digits and low single digits, respectively. These businesses continue to be impacted by lower post-COVID-related biopharma demand and ongoing stress on hospital budgets. As procedure volumes continue to improve, hospital budgets stabilize and we work through post-COVID-related impacts, we are confident in the long-term outlook of this business.\nHealth Care's second quarter operating income was $411 million, down 16% year-on-year. Operating margins were 19.8%, down 2.8 percentage points year-on-year, however, increased sequentially 1.9 percentage points. Year-on-year operating margins were impacted by lower sales volume, restructuring costs and inflation impacts. These headwinds were partially offset by benefits from strong spending discipline, productivity actions and pricing.\nFinally, on Slide 12. Our Consumer business posted second quarter sales of $1.3 billion. Organic sales declined 2.2% year-on-year as discretionary spending on hardline categories remains soft. We expect this trend to continue into the second half of the year.\nOrganic sales grew slightly in home, health and auto care, while home improvement and stationery and office businesses both declined. Consumer second quarter operating income was $235 million, down 5% compared to last year, with operating margins of 18.2%, down 40 basis points year-on-year but up 3.2 percentage points sequentially. The year-on-year decline in operating margins was driven by lower sales volumes, restructuring costs and inflation impacts. These headwinds were partially offset by benefits from strong spending discipline, productivity actions and pricing.\nThat concludes our remarks on the second quarter. Please turn to Slide 14 for an update on our full year expectations. During our January earnings call, we highlighted that we expected macroeconomic and end-market uncertainties to continue to persist into the year. In addition, we noted that we were starting to see the healing of supply chains. However, we expected to continue to see headwinds from raw material availability and inflation, although at a lower level than 2022.\nWe also stated that we were not satisfied with our performance and we would be taking a deeper look at everything we do as we continue to prepare for the spin of Health Care. As a result, we noted that as we move through the year, we would be taking additional actions to improve supply chain performance, drive simplification and bring us closer to our customers.\nWhile we have more work to do, let me take a moment to provide a few examples on the progress we have made through the first half of the year. Starting with our sales performance. While end markets continue to play out as expected, Q1 and Q2 revenue was slightly above our expectations. Our teams continue to relentlessly focus on serving our customers, work down backlogs and leverage the use of data and data analytics to drive improvements in demand planning.\nNext, as we have mentioned, we are aggressively addressing structure. We are on track with our actions to reduce structure across the company, including at corporate, in our business segments and in manufacturing supply chain. We have initiated the transition of 24 countries to an export model, partnering with local distribution to serve those customers and markets.\nIn addition, we have made good progress in reducing corporate structure, including the exit of our aviation operations and our conference center in Northern Minnesota. And finally, we continue to adjust our production levels to end-market trends, manage inventory and aggressively control spending.\nAs a result of our actions, along with improvements in global supply chains and raw material availability, we are able to deliver first half performance better than anticipated, particularly for margins, earnings and cash flow.\nIn the first half of the year, on an adjusted basis, we delivered sales of $15.7 billion, operating margins of 18.6% and earnings per share of $4.14. These results included $264 million in pretax restructuring charges or a headwind to margins of 1.7 percentage points and to earnings of $0.38 per share. In addition, our strong operational execution and working capital management, particularly inventories, helped us to deliver $2.3 billion of adjusted free cash flow with a conversion rate of 105%.\nTurning to guidance. We are raising our full year adjusted earnings expectation as a result of our strong first half operational execution as evidenced by an improving margin rate. We now expect full year's earnings in the range of $8.60 to $9.10 versus a prior range of $8.50 to $9.\nWe continue to closely monitor end-market trends across all our businesses, particularly in electronics, consumer retail, industrial and China and have yet to see signs of improvement in trends. Therefore, we currently see organic growth tracking to the lower end of our range of flat to minus 3%. This reflects our performance to date along with our year-on-year headwind from disposable respirators tracking to the high end of our anticipated range or down approximately $550 million along with continued macro and end-market uncertainty. And finally, our full year adjusted free cash flow conversion expectation remains unchanged in a forecasted range of 90% to 100%.\nLooking ahead to the third quarter. We expect end-market trends to be very similar to Q2. Hence, we anticipate third quarter adjusted sales to be approximately $8 billion. The impact from the COVID-related decline in disposable respirators and last year's exit of Russia is anticipated to be a year-on-year headwind to sales of approximately $130 million or 1.5 percentage points.\nThird quarter pretax restructuring costs are expected to be in the range of $125 million to $175 million with pretax benefits of $125 million to $150 million. Taken together, we expect third quarter adjusted earnings per share will be in the range of $2.25 to $2.40.\nTo wrap up, we continue to have a strong focus on serving our customers, improving the execution in our supply chain, making progress in our restructuring actions, managing costs and investing in the business while navigating ongoing end-market weakness. We expect our actions will continue to build momentum and improve our organic growth, margins and cash flow performance into the future.\nI want to thank our customers and suppliers for their partnership and the 3M employees for their hard work and dedication as they continue to deliver for our customers and shareholders. I am confident in our future. As we have said, as we exit 2023, we will be a stronger, leaner and more focused 3M.\nThat concludes my remarks. We will now take your questions.",

Welcome to the A. O. Smith Corporation Q2 2023 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. Without further ado, I'll hand the conference over to your first speaker, Helen Gurholt. Helen, please go ahead.\n\nHelen E. Gurholt\n\nVP of IR and Financial Planning & Analysis, A. O. Smith Corporation\n\nThank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to the A.O. Smith Second Quarter Conference Call. I'm Helen Gurholt, Vice President, Investor Relations and Financial Planning and Analysis. Joining me today are Kevin Wheeler, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Chuck Lauber, Chief Financial Officer.\nIn order to provide improved transparency into the operating results of our business, we provide non-GAAP measures. Free cash flow is defined as cash from operations less capital expenditures, adjusted earnings, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted segment earnings and adjusted corporate expenses exclude the impact of impairment charges nonoperating noncash pension income and expenses as well as legal judgment income and terminated acquisition-related expenses. We also provide total segment earnings. Reconciliations from GAAP measures to non-GAAP measures are provided in the appendix at the end of this presentation and on our website.\nA friendly reminder that some of our comments and answers during this conference call will be forward-looking statements that are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include matters that we described in this morning's press release, among others. Also, as a courtesy to others in the question queue, please limit yourself to 1 question and 1 follow-up per turn. If you have multiple questions, please rejoin the queue. We will be using slides as we move through today's call. You can access them on our website at investors.aosmith.com.\nI will now turn the call over to Kevin to begin our prepared remarks. Please turn to the next slide.\n\nKevin J. Wheeler\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, A. O. Smith Corp.\n\nThank you, Helen, and good morning, everyone. I'm on Slide 4, and we'll review a few highlights of our second quarter results. Our team delivered record adjusted EPS of $1.01 in the second quarter, driven by strong performance in our operating segment. We saw margin expansion in our North America segment, primarily due to a more favorable price cost relationship as well as robust demand for our commercial and residential water heaters. Our Rest of World segment delivered improved performance in the second quarter even as headwinds in the economy and currency exchange continue in China. Both China and India delivered sales growth of 15% local currency in the second quarter.\nPlease turn to Slide 5. North America water heater sales decreased 2% in the second quarter of 2023 as higher volumes are offset by lower pricing. We saw continued resilience in residential water heater demand and year-over-year improvement in our commercial water heater business. Our North America boiler sales declined 13% in the second quarter compared to a tough comp last year as lower volumes more than offset the benefits from pricing. Channel inventory levels of residential and light commercial boilers remain elevated in the quarter as a warmer-than-normal winter resulted in lower industry demand. We believe channel inventory levels are approaching normal levels at the end of the quarter.\nDemand for our custom commercial high-efficiency condensing boilers, particularly our Hellcat CREST boilers with O2 sensing technology were steady in the quarter and continues to gain traction in the market. North America water treatment sales were down 2% in the second quarter of 2023 compared to another tough comp in 2022 as pricing and strong e-commerce sales were offset by lower sales in our specialty wholesale and dealer channels. Sales in the first half of 2022 benefited from strong shipments as supply chain constraints improved, and we worked out our order backlog.\nI'm particularly pleased with the margin improvement we have seen this quarter in our North America water treatment business. In China, second quarter sales increased 15% in local currency compared to the second quarter of 2022 which was negatively impacted by COVID-19-related shutdowns. Demand continued to improve for our products, particularly for residential and commercial water treatment products. Sales of water treatment consumables were particularly strong in the quarter. We also saw a favorable mix in our water treatment and electric water heater product categories this quarter as recently launched products continue to be well received by the market.\nI'm now on Slide 6. According to our recent national consumer survey, nearly 9 out of 10 Americans have concerns about microplastics in their drinking water. Reducing plastic pollution has long been a priority for our North America water treatment business. Our North America water treatment products filter enough water to potentially eliminate over 1 billion single-use plastic bottles per year. I am pleased to announce that all of our countertop and undersink water filters are now independently certified to remove up to 99.6% of microplastics in addition to over 70 other contaminants, including PFAS and pesticides. We remain committed to leading the charge in identifying and becoming certified to remove [ macrocontaminants ] as they emerge.\nI'll now turn the call over to Chuck, who will provide more details on our second quarter performance.\n\nCharles T. Lauber\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, A. O. Smith Corp.\n\nThank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I'm on Slide 7. Second quarter sales in the North America segment were $722 million, up 3% decline from the same period last year. The decrease is primarily driven by higher commercial and residential water heater volumes that were more than offset by lower boiler sales and pricing. Lower volumes contributed to approximately 1/2 of the organic growth decline. North America adjusted segment earnings of $194 million increased 19% compared with the second quarter of 2022. Adjusted operating margin of 26.9% improved 510 basis points from the segment adjusted operating margin in the second quarter of last year. The higher segment earnings and operating margin were primarily due to lower steel costs and higher volumes of commercial and residential water heaters partially offset by lower boiler volumes.\nMoving to Slide 8. Rest of World segment sales of $244 million increased 6% year-over-year and 12% on a constant currency basis. Currency translation unfavorably impacted segment sales by approximately $14 million. Our sales increase was primarily driven by higher consumer demand and favorable mix in China, particularly for residential and commercial water treatment products. India sales grew 15% in local currency in the second quarter compared to last year. Rest of World segment earnings of $28 million increased 56% compared to segment earnings in 2022. Segment operating margin was 11.6%, and an increase of 370 basis points compared to the second quarter of last year, primarily as a result of higher volumes of water treatment products and positive mix.\nPlease turn to Slide 9. We generated free cash flow of $236 million in the first half of 2023, higher than the first half of 2022 due to higher earnings and lower working capital cash outlays primarily related to lower inventory levels and lower 2022 incentive payments paid in 2023. Our cash balance totaled $410 million at the end of June, and our net cash position was $204 million. Our leverage ratio was 9.8% as measured by total debt to total capital. Our strong annual free cash flow and solid balance sheet enable us to focus on capital allocation priorities and return of cash to shareholders.\nEarlier this month, our Board approved our next quarterly dividend of [ $0.30 ] per share. We repurchased approximately 1,075,000 shares of common stock in the first half of 2023 for a total of $70 million. We are committed to repurchasing $300 million of our shares for the full year of 2023.\nLet's now turn to Slide 10. In addition to returning capital to shareholders, we continue to see opportunities for organic growth driven by innovation and new product development across all of our product lines and geographies. We believe that our technology leadership and culture of innovation puts us in a strong position to capitalize on the mega trends of decarbonization and sustainability. The strength of our balance sheet also allowed us to pursue strategic acquisitions as we grow organically.\nPlease turn to Slide 11 in our revised 2023 earnings guidance and outlook. We've increased our 2023 outlook with an expected adjusted EPS range of $3.45 and $3.60 per share. The midpoint of our adjusted EPS range represents an increase of 12% compared with 2022 adjusted EPS. Our outlook is based on a number of key assumptions, including our outlook assumes a relatively stable supply chain with limited disruption. We remain in close contact with our suppliers and logistics providers to manage and resolve supply chain issues as they arise. We have increased our North America full year margin guidance to a range of between 24% and 24.25% based on our full year outlook on volumes and price cost relationship. We will have higher steel costs in the back half of the year, which will put some pressure on North America margin. We forecast that steel costs in the second half of the year will be approximately 20% higher than the first half of the year. Our guidance assumes that other costs outside of steel remain at current levels.\nOur Rest of the World margin guidance of approximately 10% remains unchanged. We expect to generate free cash flow of between $550 million and $600 million. For the year, CapEx should be between $70 million and $75 million. Corporate and other expenses are expected to be approximately $55 million. Our effective tax rate is estimated to be approximately 24%. And we expect to repurchase approximately $300 million of shares of our stock, resulting in an average outstanding diluted shares of $151 million at the end of 2023.\nI'll now turn the call back over to Kevin, who will provide more color on our key markets and top line growth outlook for 2023, all staying on Slide 11. Kevin?\n\nKevin J. Wheeler\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, A. O. Smith Corp.\n\nThank you, Chuck. We revised our 2023 sales projection to be a range of flat to up 2% compared to 2022, which includes the following assumptions. Residential water heater demand was resilient in the first half of the year. Therefore, we project 2023 residential water heater industry volumes to be flat to up 2% compared to last year. We continue to monitor proactive replacement and new housing completions, both of which remain strong. Demand for commercial electric water heaters greater than 55 gallons was strong in the first half of the year, which leads us to raise our guidance for commercial water heater industry volumes to increase mid-teens compared to 2022. We maintain our guidance that our sales in China will grow 3% to 5% in local currency in 2023. We believe it will take time for consumer confidence to strengthen and for the economy to improve in China. Our forecast assumes that the Chinese currency will devalue approximately 5% in 2023 compared to 2022.\nWe have decreased our outlook for our boiler business from being up mid-single digits to being down high single digits compared to last year. Last year, our boiler business grew 28% compared to 2021 partially driven by our backlog reduction during the year. We believe channel inventory levels of residential and light commercial boilers were elevated coming into 2023. The mild winter and warm spring resulted in lower demand coming out of the heating season, which slowed channel inventory reduction efforts.\nOrders for our energy-efficient custom commercial condensing boilers remain steady. Our outlook for North America water treatment sales growth of 5% to 7% for 2023 has not changed. We project that our sales in India will grow 15% compared to last year.\nPlease turn to Slide 12. We are very pleased with our performance in the first half of 2023. Demand for our commercial water heaters was strong. We saw resilient demand for our residential water heaters as new housing completion and proactive replacement remain robust. Our second quarter '23 -- 2023 North America adjusted operating margin of 26.9% was driven by improved price cost relationship and will lead to a full year margin improvement even as our steel costs rise in the second half of the year. Our China business performed well in a weak economy in the second quarter with sales growth of 15% and operating margins of over 12%. Market-leading products such as our high flow and hot water purifiers as well as dual tank electric water heaters led to a positive mix in the quarter. India continues to outperform the industry as our innovative new products drive market share gains.\nAs a final note, the U.S. Department of Energy has recently issued its proposal to raise the minimum energy efficiency standards for residential water heaters that is targeted to be affected in 2029. As we review the DOE's proposal, we continue to dialogue with the DOE and other industry participants to offer guidance from our unique market leadership perspective to ensure the final proposal considers all factors that may impact consumers, including affordability, installation challenges, market adoption and consumer awareness as well as state and local electrification regulations.\nAs a leader in energy-efficient water heater solutions, we believe A. O. Smith is well positioned to deliver a broad range of products that will meet or exceed the DOE requirements. And finally, our focus remains on meeting the needs of our customers as we continue to execute key strategic objectives to advance our position as a global water technology leader.\nWith that, we conclude our prepared remarks, and we are now available for your questions.",

Welcome to the 3M first quarter earnings conference call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Tuesday, April 25, 2023.\nI would now like to turn the call over to Bruce Jermeland, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at 3M.\n\nBruce Jermeland\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter earnings conference call. With me today are Mike Roman, 3M's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Monish Patolawala, our Chief Financial and Transformation Officer. Mike and Monish will make some formal comments, then we will take your questions. Please note that today's earnings release and slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on the homepage of our Investor Relations website at 3m.com.\nPlease turn to Slide 2. Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement. During today's conference call, we'll be making certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M's future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions.\nPlease note throughout today's presentation, we'll be making references to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures can be found in the attachments to today's press release.\nWith that, please turn to Slide 3, and I'll now hand the call off to Mike. Mike?\n\nMichael F. Roman\n\nnullChairman & Chief Executive Officer\n\nThank you, Bruce. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Before I recap our first quarter, I want to discuss actions we are taking to improve our performance. As you recall, over the past few years, we have implemented a new global operating model led by our 4 business groups, which included moving to a common global supply chain design end-to-end. We have since advanced our digital capabilities, further repositioned our portfolio and continued to invest in growth and productivity.\nOur experience throughout this journey, including lessons learned during the pandemic, supply chain disruptions and changing global trends has shown us what is working and what we can do better. As I said last quarter, we are looking at everything we do. Today, we are announcing additional actions to improve our cost structure, streamline our corporate center, strengthen our supply chain, enhance our go-to-market models and drive greater focus in markets where 3M science gives us a clear competitive advantage.\nWe will reduce costs at the corporate center by eliminating management layers across the company. We are broadly reducing our corporate shared services like our central design group. We are reducing rooftops worldwide, including exiting our conference center in Northern Minnesota. We are also simplifying and modernizing our technology by moving to the cloud and removing hundreds of legacy systems. This reduces costs and provides us greater agility and flexibility to invest in differentiated digital areas like data, analytics and automation while increasing investments in cybersecurity.\nWe are simplifying our supply chain structure to better align with our businesses and improve performance in every aspect of plan, source, make and deliver while adding industry expertise to help drive our progress. The actions we are announcing today will help us complete our shift from area to global management, simplifying reporting lines and clarifying accountability.\nWe are also taking out layers of management and duplication of activities across all areas of supply chain. Our progress in digital gives us better tools to use in the areas of planning, sourcing and logistics, removing redundant work and improving productivity. And we will prioritize our continuous improvement efforts in our largest factory operations. We will have a more efficient support structure and operating model to improve service, cost and inventory.\nWe are streamlining go-to-market models to better align with customers, improve agility and reduce management structure. This is driven by our relentless focus on optimizing the path to our customer. We are not adopting a one-size-fits-all approach. We are customizing an approach for each business that ensures greater focus.\nIn Safety and Industrial and Transportation and Electronics, we will eliminate certain area-based business group leadership and move to a division-led model. In Transportation and Electronics, we will also combine 2 divisions, further reducing structure. In Consumer, we will simplify how we go to market with each area team aligned around their prioritized product portfolios and leading brands.\nIn addition, we are changing our go-to-market model in approximately 30 countries around the globe, which represent less than 5% of our revenue. In these countries, we will leverage our digital and export capabilities and move to a model partnering with distributors with deep local knowledge and infrastructure, enabling us to significantly reduce our people, real estate and other related costs.\nThrough our actions, we plan to eliminate approximately 6,000 positions globally in addition to the reduction of 2,500 global manufacturing roles we announced in January. In total, this represents about 10% of our global workforce and senior executive roles. Reductions will span all functions, businesses and geographies and be completed in accordance with local regulations. We expect to take total pre-tax restructuring charges of $700 million to $900 million with approximately half of the charges to occur in 2023 and the balance to be largely taken in 2024.\nWe anticipate the actions will drive savings in the range of $700 million to $900 million, expand margins and position 3M for future growth. We estimate that approximately half of the annualized savings will be realized in 2023.\nAt the same time, we are continuing to build 3M for the future, prioritizing high-growth markets like automotive electrification, personal safety, home improvement, semiconductors and health care. We are also investing in large emerging markets that demand our material science innovation, including climate technology, industrial automation, next-generation electronics and sustainable packaging. As we move forward, we will drive additional cost reductions through improvements in sourcing, yield, productivity, factory automation and network optimization of our plants and distribution centers.\nToday, we are also announcing changes to align our leadership to our future direction. Effective immediately, Mike Vale is appointed Group President and Chief Business and Country Officer, a new role on the company's corporate operations committee reporting to me. In this new role, he will have responsibility for 3 of the company's 4 business groups: Safety and Industrial, Transportation and Electronics and Consumer and also Country Governance.\nJeff Lavers, who is leading our Consumer and Health Care business, will now lead our Health Care business and support the company's progress towards a spin-off and the transition to a new CEO and management team. Jeff continues to report to me. Karina Chavez will become Group President, Consumer. Chris Goralski will become Group President, Safety and Industrial. Ashish Khandpur will continue as Group President, Transportation and Electronics.\nAll 3 are experienced leaders at 3M and well positioned to help drive the actions we announced today to improve our performance. Karina, Chris and Ashish will report to Mike Vale. In total, today's action will make 3M more streamlined and competitive.\nNow please turn to Slide 4 for a summary of our first quarter. In an economic environment that remains challenging, we stayed relentlessly focused on serving customers and aggressively managed costs. We posted adjusted organic growth of minus 5.6% or minus 2.2% excluding our Russia exit and decline in disposable respirator sales. We delivered adjusted margins of nearly 18% and adjusted earnings of $1.97 per share while expanding our adjusted free cash flow to $900 million.\nToday, we are affirming our full year guidance for organic growth, EPS and cash flow, which is inclusive of the restructuring charges and related savings. End-market trends played out as expected with ongoing weakness in consumer-facing markets. We saw continued strength in certain industrial markets, including automotive, electrical markets and abrasives.\nOur actions to reduce costs, which included plant spending, external services, travel and hiring, helped drive stronger-than-expected earnings and margins. We also continued to improve inventory levels, enabling us to deliver strong cash flow. At the same time, we are advancing our strategic priorities for long-term value creation as we make progress on the spin of our Health Care business.\nTurning to litigation. On Combat Arms, 3M continues to support Aearo Technologies through mediation discussions. We are focused on achieving a resolution that is efficient and equitable for all parties. With respect to PFAS, we continue to address litigation by defending ourselves in court or negotiating resolutions as appropriate. We also have a dedicated team to facilitate an orderly transition as we exit PFAS manufacturing and work to discontinue the use of PFAS in our products by the end of 2025.\nIn summary, we are improving day-to-day operational execution, advancing our strategic priorities and taking necessary actions to move 3M forward. We are dedicated to building on our progress, delivering greater value for our customers and shareholders and exiting 2023 a stronger and more focused 3M.\nMonish will now take you through the details of the quarter. Monish?\n\nMonish D. Patolawala\n\nSenior VP & CFO, 3M Company\n\nThank you, Mike, and I wish you all a very good morning. Please turn to Slide 5. As Mike mentioned, the first quarter macro and end-market trends have played out largely as anticipated. We experienced significant end-market weakness in consumer electronics, shifting consumer spending patterns along with the retailer destocking and mixed industrial end markets. We also continue to navigate COVID-related impacts in China and the ongoing geopolitical challenges in Europe.\nGiven the expected challenging start to the year, we relentlessly focused on serving our customers and took very aggressive actions to manage costs and spending. These actions, coupled with a lower-than-expected foreign currency headwind, enabled us to deliver a first quarter that was better than forecasted.\nFirst quarter total adjusted sales was $7.7 billion or down 9.7% year-on-year. In addition to focusing on serving customers, first quarter sales benefited from a smaller-than-anticipated headwind to sales from foreign currency translation. The first quarter year-on-year translation impact was a minus 2.8% or approximately $230 million versus a forecast of minus 3% to minus 4%.\nWe also experienced a 1.3% sales decline from divestitures or approximately $120 million versus Q1 last year. This decline was largely from the third quarter 2022 divestiture of Food Safety, along with the deconsolidation of Aearo Technologies.\nOn an adjusted organic basis, first quarter sales decreased 5.6% versus last year. This result included an expected year-on-year headwind of approximately $300 million or 3.4 percentage points related to lower disposable respirator demand and the exit of our operations in Russia last year in the third quarter. Excluding this decline, Q1 adjusted organic sales growth was minus 2.2%.\nFirst quarter adjusted operating income was $1.4 billion with operating margins of 17.9% and adjusted earnings of $1.97.\nTurning to the components that impacted first quarter operating margins and earnings year-on-year performance. Our Q1 margin and earnings reflect the previously mentioned lower sales volume. This lower sales volume, combined with our efforts to reduce inventories, resulted in lower manufacturing productivity versus last year's first quarter. We were able to partially offset these headwinds through pricing performance and aggressive cost management, resulting in a net headwind to margins of 90 basis points and $0.17 to earnings.\nAs mentioned, we faced a challenging Q1 comp from last year's Omicron-driven disposable respirator demand, along with the exit of operations in Russia. This sales comp headwind resulted in a negative impact to operating margins of 1.1 percentage points and to earnings of $0.21 per share.\nWe continued our focus on improving our manufacturing and supply chain operations, including executing on restructuring actions to streamline the organization and adjust to slowing end-market demand. Restructuring charges in the quarter were $52 million or a year-on-year headwind of 50 basis points to margin and $0.05 to earnings per share. The carryover impact of higher raw material, logistics and energy cost inflation created a year-on-year headwind of approximately $100 million or a negative 130 basis point impact to operating margins and $0.15 to earnings.\nAs mentioned, foreign currency translation was a negative 2.8% impact to total sales. This resulted in a headwind of 30 basis points to margins and $0.10 to earnings per share. Divestitures, primarily Food Safety, along with the deconsolidation of Aearo Technologies, resulted in a year-on-year headwind of $0.03 to earnings per share in the quarter. Finally, other financial items increased earnings by a net $0.05 per share year-on-year driven by lower share count, partially offset by higher non-op pension expense.\nPlease turn to Slide 6. First quarter adjusted free cash flow was approximately $950 million, up 24% year-on-year with conversion of 87%, up 37 percentage points versus last year's Q1. This year-on-year improvement was driven by lower annual incentive cash compensation and a strong focus on working capital management, particularly inventory improvement.\nDuring the quarter, we continued to address manufacturing production levels to better align with end-market trends. Since last August, we have driven an approximately $500 million reduction in inventory levels. As I've said before, as supply chains heal and we progress the use of data and data analytics, we will see a reduction in inventory levels.\nAdjusted capital expenditures were $445 million in the quarter, up 15% year-on-year as we continue to invest in growth, productivity and sustainability. During the quarter, we returned nearly $900 million to shareholders. Net debt at the end of Q1 stood at $12 billion, down 10% year-on-year with net debt-to-EBITDA at 1.5x.\nPlease turn to Slide 8 for our business group performance. I will start with our Safety and Industrial business, which posted sales of $2.8 billion or down 6% organically. This result included a year-on-year comp headwind of $285 million due to last year's Omicron-driven disposable respirator demand and exit of Russia. Excluding the impact from disposable respirators and Russia exit, Safety and Industrial sales grew nearly 4% organically in Q1.\nOrganic growth was led by high single-digit increases in automotive aftermarket, electrical markets and abrasives, while the personal safety business declined mid-teens primarily due to the decline in disposable respirator demand. Excluding the impact from disposable respirators, the personal safety business grew low double digits organically.\nTurning to the rest of Safety and Industrial. Organic growth declined high single digits in industrial adhesives and tapes due to consumer electronic softness. And closure and masking systems was down low single digits as consumers pull back on discretionary spending, impacting e-commerce shipments. Roofing granules were down low single digits.\nAdjusted operating income was $562 million or down 19% versus last year. Adjusted operating margins were 20.2%, down 2.4 percentage points year-on-year. Margin headwinds were driven by lower sales volume, manufacturing and supply chain headwinds, carryover raw material, logistics and energy cost inflation, investments in the business and impacts from China COVID-related challenges. These headwinds were partially offset by benefits from pricing, aggressive spending discipline and productivity actions.\nMoving to Transportation and Electronics on Slide 9, which posted Q1 adjusted sales of $1.7 billion. Adjusted organic growth declined 11.3% year-on-year, heavily impacted by a significant decline in demand for consumer electronic devices. Our auto OEM business increased approximately 6% year-on-year, in line with global car and light truck builds. We continue to gain penetration on new automotive platforms and expect to outperform build rates over the long run.\nOur electronics business saw adjusted organic sales declines in the mid-30% range. This business continues to be impacted by significant end-market weakness along with tiers and OEMs aggressively reducing inventories, particularly for smartphones, tablets and TVs.\nTurning to the rest of Transportation and Electronics. Advanced Materials had adjusted organic growth of high single digits year-on-year, while both transportation safety and commercial solutions declined. Transportation and Electronics delivered $284 million in adjusted operating income, down 36% year-on-year. Adjusted operating margin was 16.7%, down 5.5 percentage points year-on-year.\nMargin headwinds were driven by sales volume declines, manufacturing and supply chain headwinds, carryover raw material, logistics and energy cost inflation, investments in the business and impacts from China COVID-related challenges. These headwinds were partially offset by benefits from pricing, aggressive spending discipline and productivity actions.\nLooking at our Health Care business on Slide 10. Q1 sales were $2 billion with organic growth of 1.4% versus last year. Excluding the impact on the exit of Russia, Health Care grew Q1 organic sales by approximately 2%. Sales in our Medical Solutions business and oral care grew low single digits organically year-on-year, while Health Information Systems was flat due to strained hospital budgets. Separation and purification declined high single digits due to the normalization of post-COVID-related biopharma demand.\nFirst quarter elective healthcare procedure volumes were approximately 90% of pre-COVID levels as nurse labor shortages and strained hospital budgets continue to impact the pace of recovery. We continue to expect procedure volumes to improve as we progress through the year.\nHealth Care's first quarter operating income was $360 million, down 19% year-on-year. Operating margins were 17.9%, down 3 percentage points. Year-on-year operating margins were impacted by manufacturing and supply chain headwinds, carryover raw material logistics, and energy cost inflation, and investments in the business. These headwinds were partially offset by benefits from pricing, aggressive spending discipline, and productivity actions.\nLastly on slide 11, our Consumer business posted first-quarter sales of $1.2 billion. Organic sales declined 6.8% year-on-year with particular weakness in the U.S., which was down high single digits. Stationery and office grew low single digits organically year-on-year, while the home improvement, home health and auto care business declined organically. Relative to first quarter last year, consumers have shifted their spending patterns to more nondiscretionary items and retailers have aggressively reduced their inventory levels. We expect consumers to remain cautious with their discretionary spending as we move forward through the year.\nConsumer's first quarter operating income was $179 million, down 18% compared to last year with operating margins of 15%, down 1.8 percentage points year-on-year. The year-on-year decline in operating margins was driven by lower sales volume, manufacturing and supply chain headwinds and carryover raw material, logistics and energy cost inflation. These headwinds were partially offset by benefits from pricing, aggressive spending discipline and productivity actions.\nThat concludes our remarks on the first quarter. Please turn to Slide 13 for a discussion on our outlook for the year and the second quarter. We are maintaining our full year guidance, reflecting a macroeconomic and end-market environment that remains very fluid and uncertain. Our outlook continues to incorporate the expected second half improvement in macroeconomic forecasts, including in China.\nWe also anticipate the continued healing of global supply chains, which will help support ongoing product cost improvements in our manufacturing and supply chain operations, along with working capital performance, particularly inventory reductions. As a reminder, our full year adjusted organic sales growth is expected to be in the range of minus 3% to flat. This range includes an estimated 2 percentage point headwind from the ongoing decline in disposable respirator demand, along with the impact of our exit from Russia. Adjusted earnings are expected to be in the range of $8.50 to $9 per share. Full year adjusted free cash flow conversion remains forecasted in the range of 90% to 100%.\nTurning to our outlook for the second quarter. First, looking at external macroeconomic forecasts, both global GDP and IPI are currently expected to improve year-on-year and sequentially. The softness we experienced in Q1 in consumer electronics and consumer retail is expected to continue into Q2. We expect both sequential and year-on-year increase in auto bills, while health care procedure volumes are anticipated to be similar to Q1 levels and industrial end markets are expected to remain mixed.\nAs discussed, we implemented very aggressive cost controls in the first quarter given the challenging start to the year, including on travel, advertising, external services and head count management. While we will remain disciplined, we expect to increase investments as we progress through the year to support end-market demand improvement in the second half and into the future.\nIncluding these factors, our expectations for Q2 are for total adjusted sales to be in the range of $7.7 billion to $7.9 billion versus $8.4 billion last year or down 6% to 8% year-on-year. Organic sales is expected to be down low to mid-single digits, which includes the forecasted year-on-year headwind of approximately 1.5% from disposable respirators.\nAnd finally, foreign currency translation is expected to be approximately a minus 2% headwind to sales versus last year's Q2 and divestitures a year-on-year headwind of minus 1%. From an EPS perspective, we estimate that second quarter adjusted earnings per share will be in the range of $1.50 to $1.75, including a pre-tax restructuring charge of $175 million to $250 million or $0.25 to $0.35 per share. This range also incorporates the continued softness in organic sales and expected increase in investments, higher non-op interest costs and an adjusted tax rate of 18.5% to 19.5%.\nTo wrap up, 2023 is a pivotal year for 3M from an execution perspective. As I mentioned, we aggressively managed cost, focused on serving customers while navigating end-market weakness, particularly in consumer-facing markets as we started the year. We expect organic sales volumes will improve as consumer retail and consumer electronics markets stabilize, China work through its COVID-related challenges as our year-on-year comps ease.\nThe actions we announced today will enable us to exit 2023 stronger than we started and provide for significant margin and cash flow improvement into the future. I want to thank our customers and suppliers for their partnerships and the 3M employees for their hard work and dedication as they continue delivering for our customers.\nThat concludes my remarks. We will now take your questions.",

Welcome to the A. O. Smith First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call.\n[Operator Instructions]\nPlease be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Helen Gurholt. Helen, please go ahead.\n\nHelen E. Gurholt\n\nVP of IR and Financial Planning & Analysis, A. O. Smith Corporation\n\nThank you, Ellinor. Good morning, and welcome to the A. O. Smith First Quarter Conference Call. I'm Helen Gurholt, Vice President, Investor Relations and Financial Planning and Analysis. Joining me today are Kevin Wheeler, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Chuck Lauber, Chief Financial Officer.\nIn order to provide improved transparency into the operating results of our business, we provide non-GAAP measures. Free cash flow is defined as cash from operations less capital expenditures. Adjusted earnings, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted segment earnings and adjusted corporate expenses exclude the impact of impairment charges, non-operating non-cash pension expenses as well as legal judgment income and terminated acquisition-related expenses. We also provide total segment earnings. Reconciliations from GAAP measures to non-GAAP measures are provided in the appendix at the end of this presentation and on our website.\nA friendly reminder that some of our comments and answers during this conference call will be forward-looking statements, that are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include matters that we described in our -- this morning's press release, among others.\nAlso, as a courtesy to others in the question queue, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up per turn. If you have multiple questions, please rejoin the queue. We will be using slides as we move through today's call. You can access them on our website at investor.aosmith.com.\nI will now turn the call over to Kevin to begin our prepared remarks. Please turn to the next slide.\n\nKevin J. Wheeler\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, A. O. Smith Corp.\n\nThank you, Helen and good morning, everyone. I'm on Slide 4, and we'll review a few highlights of our first quarter results. Our team delivered record first quarter adjusted EPS of $0.94, driven by strong performance in North America with sales up 3% due to higher commercial and residential water heater volumes.\nIn addition, we saw margin expansion across our water heating, boiler and water treatment product categories due to a more favorable price/cost relationship. Our Rest of World segment delivered consistent performance in the first quarter despite headwinds in the economy and currency exchange in China. In India, our sales grew 28% in local currency in the first quarter due to strong demand for our water heating and water treatment products.\nPlease turn to Slide 5. North America water heater sales grew 3% in the first quarter of 2023 as we believe we outperformed the market and experienced resilient demand for our commercial and residential water heater products.\nSales of commercial electric products were strong in the quarter as demand returned to pre-2022 levels. Last year, commercial industry shipments were negatively impacted by our regulatory change for commercial electric products greater than 55 gallons.\nOur North America boiler sales grew 2%, driven by previously announced price increases to offset higher costs. Residential boiler volumes decreased year-over-year, primarily driven by elevated channel inventory levels coming off a particularly strong fourth quarter of 2022. We believe inventory levels have normalized by the end of the quarter.\nDemand for our commercial high-efficiency condensing boilers, particularly our Hellcat CREST boilers with O2 sensing technology remained strong. North America water treatment sales were flat in the first quarter of 2023 compared to a tough comp in 2022 as higher direct-to-consumer and e-commerce sales were offset by lower sales in our dealer and specialty wholesale channels.\nSales in the first quarter of 2022 benefited from strong shipments as supply chain constraints improved and we work down our order backlog. We believe the majority of our dealers and wholesale customers exited the first quarter with normal inventory levels.\nIn China, first quarter sales decreased 10% local currency compared to the first quarter of 2022, primarily due to weakened consumer demand. We have seen sequential improvement through April and expect that improvement to continue through the year. We believe it will take time for the Chinese economy and consumer confidence to improve. We saw a favorable price/mix in the quarter, particularly in our water treatment, as we recently introduced our large flow products that have been well received by the market.\nI'm now on Slide 6. A. O. Smith has recently been named in 2023 ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year Sustained Excellence winner by the EPA and the U.S. Department of Energy. The ENERGY STAR award is given to companies that have made a long-term commitment to energy management through their products or services.\nThis is the fifth consecutive ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year award A.O. Smith has received and the third time being named a Sustained Excellence partner. These awards are a direct result of our strategic objective to expand and enhance our high-efficiency product portfolio, including heat pumps, as evidenced by the recent launch of our Voltex AL heat pump water heater. We are committed to continue development of sustainable water heating and water treating technology.\nI'll now turn the call over to Chuck, who will provide more details on our first quarter performance.\n\nCharles T. Lauber\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, A. O. Smith Corp.\n\nThank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I'm on Slide 7. Record first quarter sales in the North America segment rose to $753 million, a 3% increase compared with the same period last year. The increase is primarily driven by higher commercial and residential water heater volumes, partially offset by pricing.\nNorth America segment earnings of $188.6 million increased 22% compared with the first quarter of 2022. Operating margin of 25.1% improved 400 basis points from the segment adjusted operating margin in the first quarter of last year. The higher segment earnings and operating margin are primarily due to higher volumes of commercial and residential water heaters and lower steel costs.\nMoving to Slide 8. Rest of the World segment sales of $219.1 million decreased 14% year-over-year and 8% on a constant currency basis. Currency translation unfavorably impacted segment sales by approximately $17 million. Our sales decrease was primarily driven by lower sales in China as consumer demand was negatively impacted by COVID-19-related headwinds.\nWe saw month-over-month improvement in consumer demand during the quarter. India sales grew 28% in local currency in the first quarter compared to 2022, as our new products have been well received by the market. Rest of the World adjusted segment earnings of $17.8 million decreased 28% compared to segment earnings in 2022.\nSegment adjusted operating margin was 8.1%, a decrease of 160 basis points compared to the first quarter of last year, primarily as a result of lower volumes in China, partially offset by lower selling costs.\nPlease turn to Slide 9. We generated free cash flow of $109 million in the first 3 months of 2023, higher than the same period in 2022, due to higher earnings and lower working capital outlays, primarily related to lower inventory levels and a lower 2022 incentive payments paid in 2023. Our cash balance totaled $496 million at the end of March, our net cash position was $155 million.\nOur leverage ratio was 16% as measured by total debt to total capital. Our strong annual free cash flow and solid balance sheet enable us to focus on capital allocation priorities and return cash to shareholders. Earlier this month, our Board approved our next quarterly dividend of $0.30 per share, which represents our 83rd consecutive year of dividend payments.\nWe repurchased approximately 821,000 shares of common stock in the first quarter of 2023 for a total of $53 million. We expect to repurchase $300 million of our shares in 2023, a $100 million increase from previous guidance.\nLet's now turn to Slide 10. In addition to returning capital to shareholders, we continue to see opportunities for organic growth driven by innovation and new product development across all of our product categories and geographies. The strength of our balance sheet allows us to pursue strategic acquisitions even in times of economic uncertainty.\nDuring the quarter, we committed to selling our business in Turkey and recognized a non-cash impairment charge of $15.6 million. Primarily in anticipation of the liquidation of the cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment. The business model in Turkey is more project-based than our core consumer and commercial water treatment business and no longer fits our current strategy.\nPlease turn to Slide 11 and our revised 2023 guidance and outlook. We've increased our 2023 outlook with an expected adjusted EPS range of $3.30 and $3.50 per share. The midpoint of our adjusted EPS range represents an increase of 8% compared with 2022 adjusted EPS.\nOur outlook is based on a number of key assumptions, including -- we assume a relatively stable supply chain, while challenges persist, disruptions are limited. We remain in close contact with our suppliers and logistics providers to manage and resolve supply chain issues as they arise.\nWe've increased our North American margin guidance from approximately 23% to a range of between 23% and 23.5%. Based on a full-year outlook on volumes and price cost relationship, we have recently seen a meaningful rise in steel index pricing, which will translate into higher input costs and relative to the first quarter, put pressure on North American margins in the back half of the year. We forecast that our steel cost in the second half of the year will be approximately 20% higher than the first half of the year.\nOur guidance assumes that other costs outside of steel remain relatively flat to our previous guidance, with favorable adjustments in our transportation cost outlook, offset by moderately higher costs outside of transportation. We expect to generate free cash flow of between $575 million and $625 million.\nFor the year, CapEx should be between $70 million and $75 million. Corporate and other expenses are expected to be approximately $55 million. Our effective tax rate is estimated to be approximately 24%. And as I noted earlier, we expect to repurchase approximately $300 million of shares of our stock, resulting in average outstanding diluted shares of $150 million at the end of 2023.\nI'll now turn the call back to Kevin, who will provide more color on our key markets and topline growth outlook and segment expectations for 2023, Staying on Slide 11. Kevin?\n\nKevin J. Wheeler\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, A. O. Smith Corp.\n\nThank you, Chuck. We revised our 2023 sales projection to be approximately flat to 2022 at the midpoint, with a range of plus or minus 2%, which includes the following assumptions. Residential water heater demand was resilient in the first quarter, and therefore, we are raising our projection for the 2023 residential water heater industry volumes to be approximately flat to last year.\nWe continue to monitor proactive replacement and new housing completions. Demand for commercial electric water heaters greater than 55 gallons was strong in the first quarter and orders remained strong in April. We have raised our guidance for commercial water heater industry volumes to increase mid-single digits compared to 2022.\nOur China business performed as expected in the first quarter. We believe it will take time for consumer confidence to strengthen and for the economy to improve in China. We reaffirm our guidance that our sales in China will grow 3% to 5% in local currency in 2023. Our guidance assumes volumes in China improved throughout the year.\nOur forecast assumes the Chinese currency will devalue approximately 2% in 2023 compared to 2022. We are adjusting our outlook for our boiler business. We believe channel inventory levels of residential boilers are more elevated coming into 2023 than what we assumed in our prior guidance. While commercial growth aligns with our previous guidance, the amount of inventory in the residential boiler market resulted in sluggish residential boiler sales in the first quarter, and guides us to an annual growth outlook of mid-single digits.\nDemand for our energy-efficient custom commercial condensing boilers was steady in the first quarter, and job quoting remains active, particularly in the key institutional vertical. Our outlook for the North America water treatment sales growth of 5% to 7% for 2023 has not changed. Based on these factors, we expect our North America segment margin to be between 23% and 23.5% and Rest of World segment margins to be approximately 10%.\nPlease turn to Slide 12. We are very pleased with our performance early in 2023. Demand for commercial electric water heaters rebounded to pre-2022 levels. We saw resilient demand for our residential water heaters. Our first quarter 2023 North America operating margin of 25.1% will drive significant full-year margin improvement even as steel costs rise.\nIn China, we saw sequential monthly improvement in our sales through April, and we expect that to continue through the year. We are pleased with our free cash flow through March, and we expect a strong rebound in free cash flow for the full year, as China emerges from COVID-19-related disruptions, and our dedicated focus on inventory reduction across our North America operations. Our focus remains on meeting the needs of our customers as well as executing our key strategic objectives to advance our position as a leader in heating and treating water, globally. Our strong brands across the portfolio, combined with technology-driven innovation and new product development will enhance our market leadership. And with our strong balance sheet, we are confident in our ability to capitalize on opportunities as we continue to execute our strategy.\nWith that, we conclude our prepared remarks, and we are now available for your questions.",

Welcome to the 3M Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Tuesday, January 24, 2023.\nI would now like to turn the call over to Bruce Jermeland, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at 3M.\n\nBruce Jermeland\n\nVP of IR, 3M Company\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings conference call. With me today are Mike Roman, 3M's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Monish Patolawala, our Chief Financial and Transformation Officer. Mike and Monish will make some formal comments, then we'll take your questions.\nPlease note that today's earnings release and slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on the home page of our Investor Relations website at 3m.com.\nPlease turn to Slide 2. Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement. During today's conference call, we'll be making certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M's future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions.\nPlease turn to Slide 3. Please note, throughout today's presentation, we'll be making references to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures can be found in the attachments to today's press release.\nBefore I hand the call over to Mike, I would like to take a moment and highlight the financial reporting change we are making starting here in Q1 2023. As we announced in our press release on December 20, we'll be exiting PFAS manufacturing by the end of 2025. As a result, we have decided to provide additional disclosure by expanding the scope of our non-GAAP measurement adjustments to include the exit of PFAS manufacturing.\nFor 2022, we have treated the Q4 PFAS manufacturing exit cost as a special item in arriving at results adjusted for special items. However, beginning in 2023, we will expand the existing adjustment for special items to also adjust for the sales and estimate of income and associated activity of PFAS manufacturing. Therefore, our outlook for 2023 reflects this adjustment.\nToday's press release, press release attachments and slide presentation provide the information regarding our 2022 performance on our existing Q4 2022 non-GAAP basis, along with some comparative information on the new 2023 outlook basis.\nWe will be providing a Form 8-K during the first quarter to reflect additional effects of this change in our non-GAAP measures and changes in segment reporting. We remain committed to providing strong transparency in reporting our financial performance. And of course, we are always here to address your questions.\nWith that, please turn to Slide 4, and I'll now hand the call off to Mike. Mike?\n\nMichael F. Roman\n\nChairman & CEO, 3M Company\n\nThank you, Bruce. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We continue to focus on delivering for our customers and shareholders in a challenging economic environment with slowing growth, inflation and supply chain disruptions.\nWe posted organic growth of 0.4% versus our expectation of 1% to 3%, along with adjusted margins of 19% and adjusted earnings of $2.28 per share. The slower-than-expected growth was due to rapid declines in consumer-facing markets such as consumer electronics and retail, a dynamic that accelerated in December as consumers sharply cut discretionary spending and retailers adjusted inventory levels.\nWe also saw a significant slowing in China due to COVID-related disruptions, along with moderating demand across industrial markets. As demand weakened, we took actions to adjust manufacturing output and control costs, which enabled us to deliver a $250 million inventory improvement.\nIn addition to actions taken in the second half of last year, today, we announced restructuring in our manufacturing operations, as we expect the demand trends that we saw in December to extend through the first half of 2023. I will discuss this more later in the call.\nWith supply chain stabilizing, we are focused on improving manufacturing operations and driving working capital. These are our most significant opportunities to improve margins and cash flow. As we navigate the external environment, we continue to position 3M for the future by investing in growth, productivity and sustainability.\nI will recap 2022 and our outlook for 2023 after Monish takes you through the quarter. Monish?\n\nMonish D. Patolawala\n\nExecutive VP and Chief Financial & Transformation Officer, 3M Company\n\nThank you, Mike, and I wish you all a very good morning. Please turn to Slide 5. As you will recall, we highlighted negative trends in our consumer retail and electronics-related businesses in late November. As the fourth quarter progressed, those trends accelerated. We also experienced significant slowing in China as COVID-related impacts resulted in a 17% decline in organic sales in December, and down 8% for the quarter.\nHealth Care continued to be challenged in its recovery to pre-pandemic levels, given labor shortages and hospital budgets being under pressure, while industrial end markets mostly remain steady.\nFourth quarter total sales were $8.1 billion or down 6.2% year-on-year, which included headwinds from foreign currency translation of minus 5% [or] $400 million which is better than the minus 7% we had expected.\nWe also experienced a 1.6% decline from divestitures or nearly $140 million largely from the third quarter divestiture of Food Safety, along with the deconsolidation of Aearo Technologies.\nOn an organic basis, fourth quarter sales increased 0.4% versus last year. This result included an anticipated falloff in disposable respirator demand and the exit of our operations in Russia. These 2 items, combined, negatively impacted organic sales growth by approximately $230 million or 2.6 percentage points. Excluding this decline, Q4 organic sales growth was 3%. On an adjusted basis, fourth quarter operating income was $1.5 billion, with operating margins of 19.1%. Adjusted earnings for the quarter were $2.28 versus $2.45 last year.\nTurning to the components that impacted fourth quarter operating margins and earnings year-on-year performance. We took a number of actions to navigate the fluid and slowing macroeconomic environment, including managing selling prices to address inflationary pressures, reducing manufacturing output, maintaining strong spending discipline and taking additional restructuring actions to streamline the organization and adjust to slowing end market demand.\nThese actions delivered an underlying benefit to operating margins of 110 basis points and $0.19 to earnings. This helped more than offset headwinds from the sales decline in disposable respirators and Russia exit, which negatively impacted operating margins by 70 basis points and earnings by $0.15 per share.\nInflation continues to impact raw material, logistics and energy costs. These pressures remain persistent and are broad-based. In Q4, raw material cost increased approximately $110 million or a negative impact of 1.4 percentage points to operating margins and $0.16 to earnings.\nAs mentioned, foreign currency translation was a negative 5% impact to total sales. This resulted in a headwind of $0.10 to earnings per share, however, was a benefit of 10 basis points to margins. Divestitures, primarily Food Safety, along with the deconsolidation of Aearo Technologies, resulted in a year-over-year headwind of $0.04 to earnings per share in the quarter. Finally, other financial items increased earnings by a net $0.09 per share year-over-year driven by lower share count, partially offset by a higher tax rate.\nPlease turn to Slide 6. Fourth quarter adjusted free cash flow was $1.7 billion, up 3% year-on-year, with conversion of 131%, up 18 percentage points versus last year's Q4.\nDuring the quarter, we aggressively adjusted manufacturing production levels to end market trends, which drove a sequential reduction in inventory levels by $250 million. For the full year, adjusted free cash flow was $4.7 billion with adjusted free cash flow conversion of 82%.\nCapital expenditures were $506 million in the quarter and $1.75 billion for the year, or up 9% year-on-year as we continue to invest in growth, productivity and sustainability. Looking to 2023, we expect capital expenditures in the range of $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion, which includes approximately $200 million of investment in water stewardship related to our exit of PFAS manufacturing.\nDuring the quarter, we returned $1.4 billion to shareholders through the combination of cash dividends of $820 million and share repurchases of $540 million. For the year, we returned $4.8 billion to shareholders, including $3.4 billion in dividends and $1.5 billion in share repurchases.\nIn addition, we reduced our outstanding share count by 16 million shares via an exchange offer associated with the Food Safety divestiture. Having a strong balance sheet and capital structure remains a priority for 3M because of the flexibility it provides. Net debt at the end of Q4 stood at $12 billion, down 4% year-on-year with net debt-to-EBITDA at 1.4x.\nPlease turn to Slide 8 for our business group performance. I will start with our Safety and Industrial business, which posted sales of $2.7 billion or up 1.3% organically. This result included a year-on-year headwind of approximately $165 million due to the ongoing decline in demand for disposable respirators. Excluding disposable respirators, Safety and Industrial grew Q4 organic sales by 7.5%. Our Personal Safety business declined mid-single digits organically, primarily due to the decline in disposable respirator demand.\nTurning to the rest of Safety and Industrial. Organic growth was led by low double-digit increases in electrical markets, automotive aftermarket and abrasives. Industrial adhesives and tapes and closure and masking systems both declined low single digits.\nOperationally, the Safety and Industrial stream drove strong execution during the fourth quarter. Adjusted operating income was $611 million or up 9% versus last year. Adjusted operating margins were 22.4%, up 2.7 percentage points as the team managed inflation with price actions, drove yield and efficiency and exercise strong spending discipline while also investing in the business.\nMoving to Transportation and Electronics, which posted sales of $2.1 billion or up 1.4% organically. Our auto OEM business increased mid-teens versus a 2% increase in global car and light truck builds. We continue to gain penetration on new automotive platforms while also benefiting from a favorable comparison due to last year's Q4 channel inventory drawdown.\nOur electronics business declined 10% organically as it continued to be impacted by the significant end market weakness, particularly for smartphones, tablets and TVs.\nTurning to the rest of Transportation and Electronics. Advanced materials grew organically low double digits, while both commercial solutions and transportation safety increased low single digits. Transportation and Electronics delivered $366 million in adjusted operating income, down 3% year-on-year. Adjusted operating margins were 17.8%, up 60 basis points versus Q4 last year. The team was able to more than offset manufacturing productivity headwinds and inflationary pressures with ongoing benefits from pricing, along with strong spending discipline and restructuring actions while investing in the business.\nLooking at our Healthcare business, Q4 sales were $2 billion, with organic growth of 1.9% versus last year. Sales in our medical solutions business declined low single digits organically. Fourth quarter elective health care procedure volumes were approximately 90% of pre-COVID levels as nurse labor shortages and strained hospital budgets continue to impact the pace of recovery. Oral care was up low single digits despite decreased consumer spending on discretionary items. And finally, separation and purification organic sales increased high single digits while Health Information Systems was up mid-single digits.\nHealth Care's fourth quarter operating income was $421 million, down 18% year-on-year. Operating margins were 20.6%, down 2.9 percentage points, with adjusted EBITDA margins of nearly 29%. Year-on-year operating margins were impacted by manufacturing productivity headwinds, increased raw materials and logistics costs, along with investments in the business. These headwinds were partially offset by pricing actions along with the strong spending discipline.\nLastly, our Consumer business posted fourth quarter sales of $1.2 billion. Organic sales declined 5.7% year-on-year with particular weakness in the U.S., which was down high single digits. All businesses declined organically as consumers pulled back on discretionary spending and retailers aggressively took actions to reduce their inventories, particularly in the U.S.\nLooking ahead, we anticipate those trends to continue at least through the first half of 2023. Consumer's fourth quarter operating income was $224 million, down 24% compared to last year, with operating margins of 17.9%, down 3.3 percentage points year-on-year.\nThis year-on-year decline in operating margins was driven by increased end market weakness, higher raw materials and logistics and outsourced hard goods manufacturing costs, manufacturing productivity headwinds, along with investments in the business. These headwinds were partially offset by selling price actions and strong spending discipline.\nI'll now turn it back over to Mike for a recap of our full year 2022 performance. Please turn to Slide 9.\n\nMichael F. Roman\n\nChairman & CEO, 3M Company\n\nThank you, Monish. 2022 was a pivotal year for 3M. Throughout the year, we took decisive actions that are foundational to our future and at the same time, maintained our focus on our customers. We addressed inflation through selling price actions and proactively managed cost as demand softened throughout the year.\nTo address supply chain disruptions, we did what was necessary to serve customers and reduce cycle times, including opening a new distribution center on the East Coast. We navigated COVID-related lockdowns in China. We reached agreement with the Flemish government to restart operations in Zwijndrecht and exited our Russia business.\nAs always, we put 3M science to work to solve customer needs across our market-leading businesses. In Safety and Industrial, our new robotic paint repair system received multiple prestigious honors as we continue to drive innovation in automotive manufacturing, an area we led in for more than 100 years.\nIn Consumer, we launched Scotch Cushion Lock, a sustainable alternative to plastic wrap, which was recognized by Fast Company as one of its world-changing ideas. In Health Care, we advanced our leadership in wound care, which includes our negative pressure wound therapies, becoming the first solution of its kind to surpass 2,000 peer-reviewed studies.\nIn Transportation and Electronics, we introduced new thermal barrier films to improve performance of electric car batteries, one element of our $0.5 billion automotive electrification platform, which delivered 30% organic growth in 2022. Company-wide, for the total year, we delivered organic growth of 1% or 3% excluding the impact of disposable respirators and our Russia exit.\nWe posted adjusted EPS of $10.10, along with adjusted free cash flow of $4.7 billion, with an adjusted conversion rate of 82%. We strengthened our balance sheet and reduced net debt by $0.5 billion, ending 2022 with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.4. This enabled us to invest in the business and returned $4.8 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.\nAt the same time, we took actions to position us for the long term. We divested our Food Safety business, receiving $1 billion and reducing our outstanding share count by 16 million. We continue to progress in our health care spin-off, which will create 2 world-class public companies better positioned to drive growth and value creation.\nWith respect to combat arms litigation, as last week's report from the Chapter 11 comediators indicated, 3M continues to support Aearo Technologies in this ongoing confidential mediation process. We continue to address PFAS litigation by defending ourselves in court or negotiating resolutions as appropriate.\nWe also announced we will exit all PFAS manufacturing by the end of 2025. Our decision is based on careful consideration of the external landscape, including regulatory trends and changing stakeholder expectations. We simplified and streamlined our supply chain organization and advanced our digital strategies to better serve customers. We followed through on our sustainability commitments. We are ahead of schedule installing state-of-the-art filtration technologies and factories around the world. We now have capabilities up and running at all 3 of our largest water using sites in the U.S. and in Zwijndrecht.\nWe supported employee health, safety and well-being, including new flexible work arrangements and factory investments and we advanced diversity, equity and inclusion, with each of our business groups now executing initiatives. The steps we took in 2022 and the steps we are continuing to take in 2023, position us well as we look toward the future.\nPlease turn to Slide 11. We expect market and macroeconomic challenges to persist in 2023. Based on this outlook, we expect organic growth of minus 3% to flat, along with adjusted EPS of $8.50 to $9, and adjusted free cash flow conversion of 90% to 100%.\nOur expectations reflect the slowing in demand we are seeing as we start 2023. Supply chains are improving. However, we still see headwinds from material availability and inflation, albeit at a lower level. We are not satisfied with our progress or performance. We are taking additional actions, building on the actions taken in the second half of 2022 to reduce cost, structure and inventory.\nWe have implemented strict control of hiring and discretionary spending. Today, we announced that we will reduce approximately 2,500 global manufacturing roles, a necessary decision to further align with adjusted production volumes. In addition to the actions we are taking to respond to the macroeconomic environment, we are taking a deeper look at everything we do as we prepare for the Health Care spin.\nAs we move through the year, we will take additional actions to improve supply chain performance, drive simplification and bring us even closer to our customers. At the same time, we win in the market because we stay close to customers and continue to invest in innovation even in the most difficult times.\nWe will continue to invest in growth opportunities in our businesses, aligned to global trends that take best advantage of our innovation. Automotive electrification, industrial automation, biopharma processing and home improvement are just a few examples of large, fast-growing markets where we are investing and where 3M innovation can make a difference.\nWe will continue to prepare for the spin-off of our Health Care business, which presents a tremendous value creation opportunity while at the same time, preparing 3M for future success. We will work to resolve litigation we face following through on the actions we initiated in 2022.\nUnderpinning all of our work will be the strengths of 3M, our people, our industry-leading innovation, our advanced manufacturing, our global capabilities and our iconic brands. I am confident in our future as we exit 2023, we will be a stronger, leaner and more focused 3M.\nMonish will now cover the details of our outlook. Monish?\n\nMonish D. Patolawala\n\nExecutive VP and Chief Financial & Transformation Officer, 3M Company\n\nThank you, Mike. Please turn to Slide 12. The macroeconomic environment remains very fluid and uncertain. For 2023, we anticipate that GDP and IPI will continue to moderate with both currently estimated to be around 1.5% or about half of 2022 levels. Therefore, against this backdrop, we feel it prudent to set our expectations to reflect this reality. .\nAs Mike mentioned, we estimate our full year adjusted organic sales growth to be in the range of minus 3% to flat. This includes selling prices up low single digits Therefore, organic volumes are expected to be down low to mid-single digits for the year. This range also includes an estimated 2 percentage point headwind from the ongoing decline in disposable respirator demand, along with the impact of our exit from Russia. We currently expect our disposable respirator demand to be down to pre-pandemic levels.\nAs the strength of the U.S. dollar carries into 2023, we estimate a foreign currency translation impact to sales of minus 1% to minus 2%. And divestitures that were completed in 2022 will be a headwind to sales of nearly 1 percentage point. Adjusted earnings are expected to be in the range of $8.50 to $9 per share. This range includes a combined earnings headwind of $0.55 to $0.80 per share year-on-year from the following 3 items.\nFirst, the expected sales decline of disposable respirators and exit of Russia will be an impact of minus $0.30 to minus $0.45. Second, foreign currency will be a headwind of minus $0.10 to $0.20. And third, divestiture impacts would be a minus $0.15.\nIn addition, the 2022 carryover impact of higher raw material and logistics costs, combined with energy inflation, creates a year-on-year headwind of approximately $150 million to $250 million or roughly $0.20 to $0.35 to EPS.\nAnd finally, nonoperating items are estimated to be an impact to earnings per share of flat to minus $0.10. This range includes a year-on-year increase in nonoperating pension expense of $125 million, a full year adjusted tax rate in the range of 18% to 19% and a lower year-on-year outstanding share count.\nWhile there are a number of headwinds to earnings in 2023, ultimately, our full year performance will be driven by organic sales volumes, sustained progress in global supply chains and raw material availability, and our ability to drive improvements and reduce costs in our manufacturing and supply chain operations.\nFinally, full year adjusted free cash flow conversion is forecasted to be in the range of 90% to 100%. This range includes the continued healing of global supply chains, expected improvements in working capital performance, particularly inventory reductions and full year capital expenditures of $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion, which includes approximately $200 million of investment in water stewardship related to our exit of PFAS manufacturing.\nPlease turn to Slide 13. Looking at our expected performance by business. We see safety and industrial organic sales growth to be down low single digits in 2023. This includes an estimated decline in disposable respirator sales of $450 million to $550 million or a negative impact of approximately 4 percentage points as the business returns to pre-pandemic levels. Demand across industrial end markets is moderating as customers remain cautious. Our Safety and Industrial team will also be monitoring the recovery of industrial production activity in China as we start the year.\nAdjusted organic sales growth for Transportation and Electronics, excluding the impact of the exit of PFAS manufacturing is forecasted to be down mid-single digits to flat organically. Looking across end markets, automotive unit volume production is currently forecasted to be up nearly 4% year-on-year.\nWe also expect automotive electrification trends to remain strong as we leverage our technologies and develop new innovative solutions for our automotive OEM customers. Electronics, however, is expected to be down significantly due to weak end market demand for TVs, tablets and smartphones, along with the ongoing impact of display technology shifting to OLED from LCD.\nHealth Care's organic sales growth is anticipated to be up low to mid-single digits versus 2022. We expect gradual improvement in health care elective procedure volumes as nurse labor shortages and strained hospital budgets continue to impact global health care systems.\nIn oral care, we will be monitoring consumer discretionary spending and its impact on patient visits, including orthodontic care. The Health Care team continues to create differentiated value and deliver strong margins for the attractive end markets we serve.\nAnd finally, organic sales in Consumer are estimated to be down low single digits to flat as U.S. consumers remain cautious and retailers continue to aggressively reduce the excess inventory levels. Despite these near-term challenges, the consumer team remains focused on leveraging our iconic brands and accelerating new product launches in 2023.\nPlease turn to Slide 14. Before we go to Q&A, I want to walk through how we are seeing the first quarter. First, 3 weeks into January, we are seeing continued slowing in organic sales volume as we start the year. This slow start is driven by the same weakening end market trends that impacted the finish to 2022. We expect soft consumer discretionary spending, along with retailer destocking to continue into the first quarter.\nSales of electronic devices are forecasted to be down between 10% and 30% sequentially in the first quarter, while semiconductor end markets and automotive builds are down mid-single digits sequentially. Health Care and oral care elective procedure volumes are expected to be at the same levels as Q4. And as we have noted, industrial end markets are mixed.\nAnd we anticipate the ongoing COVID-related challenges to continue in China and the geopolitical situation in EMEA to persist. Therefore, taking all of these items into consideration, we estimate Q1 total adjusted sales in the range of $7.2 billion to $7.6 billion versus $8.5 billion adjusted for the exit of PFAS manufacturing or down 10% to 15% year-on-year.\nThis anticipated year-on-year decline includes headwinds of 3 to 4 percentage points from disposable respirator sales declines and Russia exit, 3 to 4 percentage points from foreign currency translation, and 1 percentage point impact from divestitures. Taking these factors into account, we expect Q1 organic sales to be down low single digits to mid-single digits.\nFrom an EPS perspective, we estimate that first quarter adjusted earnings per share will be in the range of $1.25 to $1.65. This range is impacted by the continued slowing of organic sales volumes, a pretax restructuring charge of $75 million to $100 million or $0.10 to $0.15 per share, a tax rate of approximately 19%, along with normal Q1 items.\nAs you can see, the first quarter presents a tough start to the year. We will have our most challenging year-on-year comps related to the declining disposable respirator demand and our exit of Russia. Ultimately, organic volume trends will be the biggest factor in determining how the quarter will turn out. 2023 is an important year as we work on progressing our strategies, including preparing for the spin of Health Care, improving our manufacturing and supply chain operations, and taking actions to further streamline the organization.\nWe are focused on creating the shortest path to the customer and providing innovative solutions to their most challenging problems. We will remain nimble and take appropriate actions as we respond to changing market dynamics. And we will continue to invest in growth, productivity and sustainability to ensure the long-term success of our enterprise.\nTo wrap up, I continue to be bullish on our long-term trends. The large and attractive end markets we serve provide exciting opportunities for the future of 3M. We are not satisfied with our performance and the expected start to this year. We are working to aggressively address our operating performance in this challenging environment.\nWe expect organic sales volumes will improve as consumer retail and consumer electronic markets stabilize, China works through its COVID-related challenges and as our year-on-year comps ease. We also expect supply chains to continue to heal and raw materials and logistic cost headwinds to abate.\nTherefore, we anticipate improvements in organic growth, operating margins, earnings and cash flow as we progress through the year. As you've heard me say before, there is always more we can do and we will do to improve our performance. I want to thank our customers and suppliers for their partnerships and the 3M employees for their hard work and dedication as they continue delivering for our customers. That concludes my remarks.\nWe will now take your questions.",

Welcome to the A.O. Smith Corporation's Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. And I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Ms. Helen Gurholt. Ms. Gurholt, please go ahead.\n\nHelen E. Gurholt\n\nVP of IR and Financial Planning & Analysis, A. O. Smith Corporation\n\nGood morning and welcome to the A.O. Smith Fourth Quarter and Full Year Conference Call. I'm Helen Gurholt, Vice President, Investor Relations and Financial Planning and Analysis. Joining me today are Kevin Wheeler, Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer; and Chuck Lauber, Chief Financial Officer.\nIn order to provide improved transparency into the operating results of our business, we provide non-GAAP measures.

Wheeler\n\nChairman, President, & CEO, A. O. Smith Corporation\n\nThank you, Helen, and good morning, everyone. I'm on Slide 4 and our full year results. Our team delivered record-setting sales and year-over-year improvement in earnings on an adjusted basis despite lingering supply chain headwinds, inflation, and a significant U.S. wholesale residential channel inventory destocking activity that took place in the third quarter and began to normalize in the fourth quarter.\nResidential industry volumes increased 15% in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter.\nDespite the destocking activity, North America sales were up 11% compared to 2021 primarily due to inflation-related pricing and strong demand for our commercial and residential boilers and water treatment products. Our Rest of World segment delivered consistent performance in 2022 despite headwinds in the economy and currency exchange.\nSegment operating margins improved 120 basis points, driven by our China team improving their full year operating margins to almost 11%. In India, our sales grew 28% in local currency in 2022 and continued to be profitable.\nAs expected, we settled the majority of our pension liabilities in December of 2022 which resulted in a noncash pretax expense of $417 million or $1.60 of EPS. This expense is excluded from adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS. With our dividend and share repurchases, we returned $581 million of capital to shareholders.\nPlease turn to Slide 5. Our global A.O. Smith team delivered record sales of $3.8 billion in 2022 and adjusted EPS of $3.14, a 6% increase over 2021. We achieved a strong performance as a result of effective execution from our team. North America water heater sales grew 10% in 2022 due to 2021 pricing actions implemented in response to rising material and logistic costs, and acquisition-related revenue that was partially offset by lower residential volumes. After 2 years of greater-than-average growth, residential unit industry demand decreased approximately 12% compared to 2021, primarily due to a wholesale channel inventory destocking that occurred during the second and third quarters.\nThe order reduction we experienced from our customer was driven in part by our improved performance in delivering residential product and reducing our lead times. Commercial industry units decreased approximately 17% year-over-year. A large portion of the decrease was due to a continued weakness in electric products greater than 55-gallon which was impacted by a regulatory change at the beginning of 2022.\nWe don't expect that product category to rebound to pre-2022 levels. Despite the 2022 contraction in both the residential and commercial industries, we are pleased with our market share strength in both residential and commercial water heaters. Our North America boiler sales grew 28% driven by higher volumes and previously announced price increases to offset higher costs.\nOur supply chain improvement efforts allowed us to reduce our record backlog in the second half of 2022. Our focus on innovation, efficiency, and decarbonization contributed to strong demand for our high-efficiency condensing boilers, particularly our Hellcat CREST boilers with O2 sensing technology. North America water treatment sales grew 10% in 2022 due to pricing actions and higher volumes, particularly in our dealer and specialty wholesale channels.\nOur strategy to pursue this market with an omnichannel approach as we work to grow our share through product development and acquisition opportunities will be with our independent water quality dealers, who have been outperforming the market and gaining market share.\nIn China, full year sales decreased 5% in local currency compared to 2021 due to impacts from COVID-19-related disruptions. Our core water heating products performed well in a down market. Our water heater business comprised of residential, commercial, and filter replacement consumables grew nearly 4% in local currency and now represents almost 40% of our overall business with repeatable consumable filter sales, representing over 25% of overall water treatment sales.\nFor the year, operating margins in China were 10.7% as a result of actions taken over the past several years to rightsize the business and manage discretionary spending. China has achieved operating margins above 9% in each of the past 7 quarters.\nI'm now on Slide 6. We released our third ESG report in December. We have made significant strides in our commitment to ESG, including progress towards our GHG emission reduction goal of 10% by 2025, preventing almost 500,000 metric tons of carbon emissions in 2021 through sales of our highly efficient water heaters and boilers and achieving WAVE verification, a process developed by The Water Council as an initial step in creating this strategy to improve our water stewardship performance.\nESG concepts are embedded within the foundation of our 149-year history. The ESG report demonstrates our commitment to our values of being a good citizen, a good place to work, emphasizing innovation and preserving our good name, and achieving profitable growth.\nI'll now turn the call over to Chuck, who will provide more details on our full year and fourth quarter performance.\n\nCharles T. Lauber\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, A. O. Smith Corporation\n\nThank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone. I'm on Slide 7. Full year sales in North America segment rose to $2.8 billion, an 11% increase compared with 2021. Pricing actions, largely on water heaters, were partially offset by lower volumes of residential water heaters. Higher volumes of boilers and water treatment products also added to segment sales growth. Giant, acquired in October 2021, added incremental sales of $94 million.\nNorth America segment adjusted earnings of $611 million, increased 5% compared with 2021. The earnings benefit of inflation-related price increases and higher volumes of boilers and water treatment products was partially offset by higher material and freight costs and lower residential water heater volumes.\nAdjusted operating margin of 21.7%, a decline of 120 basis points year-over-year was driven by inflationary headwinds and volume-related production inefficiencies. We exited 2022 with our highest quarterly adjusted operating margins of the year at 23.3%.\nMoving to Slide 8. Rest of the World segment sales of $966 million decreased 7% year-over-year and 2% in constant currency basis. Currency translation unfavorably impacted segment sales by approximately $49 million, $36 million of which impacted China sales. Our sales decrease was primarily driven by lower sales in China as consumer demand was negatively impacted by COVID-19-related restrictions. India sales grew 28% in local currency in 2022 compared to 2021 as we continued to outperform the market.\nRest of the World segment earnings of $96 million increased 5% compared to segment earnings in 2021. In China, the impact from lower volumes was more than offset by lower selling, advertising, and incentive expenses. Segment operating margin improved to 10%, an increase of 120 basis points compared to 2021, primarily as a result of improved management of discretionary spending in China.\nPlease turn to Slide 9. Turning to fourth quarter performance. We delivered sales of $936 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, down 6% year-over-year, driven by lower residential water heater volumes in North America and lower consumer demand in China that more than offset inflation-related pricing actions. Adjusted earnings in the fourth quarter were $0.86 per share, compared with adjusted earnings of $0.85 per share in the fourth quarter of 2021.\nPlease turn to Slide 10. Fourth quarter sales in North America segment were $692 million, a 3% decrease compared to record sales in the fourth quarter of 2021. We saw quarter-over-quarter improvement of residential water heater demand. However, water heater volumes were still below the record industry levels in the fourth quarter of 2021.\nOur fourth quarter sales benefited from pricing actions and stronger boiler sales growth of 36%, driven by backlog reduction. North America segment adjusted earnings of $161 million decreased slightly compared with 2021. The earnings benefit of inflation-related price increases, higher boiler volumes, and lower steel costs was offset by lower residential water heater volumes. An improved price-cost relationship resulted in higher adjusted segment operating margin of 23.3%, compared with the 2021 adjusted segment margin of 23%.\nMoving to Slide 11. Fourth quarter Rest of the World segment sales of $250 million decreased 13% year-over-year, primarily driven by the impacts of unfavorable currency translation and lower consumer demand in China due to COVID-19-related restrictions. Currency translation unfavorably impacted China sales by approximately $24 million. In local currency, China sales decreased approximately 7% year-over-year. India sales grew 16% in local currency in 2022 compared to 2021.\nRest of the world segment earnings of $32 million were slightly higher than Q4 2021 segment earnings. In China, lower incentive and selling expenses offset lower volumes and currency translation headwinds, resulting in segment operating margin of 12.7%, a significant improvement over segment operating margin of 10.6% in the fourth quarter of 2021.\nPlease turn to Slide 12. We generated free cash flow of $321 million during 2022, lower than in 2021 as higher adjusted earnings were offset by lower customer deposits in China, higher 2021 incentive payments made in 2022, and working capital cash outlays primarily related to higher inventories that more than offset the lower accounts receivable balances.\nOur cash balance totaled $482 million at the end of December, and our net cash position was $137 million. Our leverage ratio was 16.5% as measured by total debt to total capital.\nNow turning to Slide 13. In addition to returning capital to shareholders, we continue to see opportunities for organic growth, innovation, and new product development across all of our product lines and geographies. We continue to target strategic acquisitions that meet our financial metrics of accretive to earnings in the first year and return our cost of capital in 3 years. The strength of our balance sheet allows us to pursue strategic acquisitions even in times of economic uncertainty. Earlier this month, our Board approved our next quarterly dividend of $0.30 per share. We have increased our dividend for 30 consecutive years.\nWe repurchased approximately 6.6 million shares of common stock in 2022 for a total of $404 million. The strength of our balance sheet also allows us to maintain our strong track record of delivering returns to shareholders. Over the past 2 years, we have returned $1 billion to shareholders through our dividend and share repurchases.\nPlease turn to Slide 14 and our 2023 earnings guidance and outlook. As previously discussed, we terminated our defined benefit pension plan at the end of 2021. The termination followed a strategy and measured glide path to de-risk our fully funded exposure to pension liabilities. The plan, which was previously sunset for benefits earned on December 31, 2014, represented over 95% of the company's pension plan liability.\nThe terminated plans' pension liability was annuitized in 2022. The pension settlement, which we completed in the fourth quarter, accelerated the recognition of $417 million of noncash pretax pension expenses. Tax benefits associated with the pension settlement were $168 million and include amounts recorded at historical tax rates and resulted in an after-tax EPS impact of $1.60.\nWe are pleased to introduce our 2023 outlook with an expected EPS range of $3.15 and $3.45 per share. The midpoint of our EPS range represents an increase of 5% compared with 2022 adjusted EPS. Our outlook is based on a number of key assumptions, including our guidance assumes that steel prices in 2023 on an annual basis will improve approximately 40% to 45% compared to 2022, including a sequential improvement of approximately 20% to 25% from the fourth quarter of 2022 to the first quarter of 2023. We have seen a flattening of the steel index and therefore, our outlook does not project a further meaningful sequential reduction in steel cost through 2023.\nRegarding other costs outside of steel, we have generally seen flattening in costs at elevated levels. While we do expect a shift in buying power to move from neutral towards the buyer's market as we progress through the year, our outlook does not assume significant improvement in nonsteel material costs in 2023.\nWe saw continued improvement in our supply chain in the second half of 2022. While challenges still persist, disruptions are limited. We remain in close contact with our suppliers and logistics providers to manage and resolve supply chain issues as they arise. We expect to generate strong free cash flow of between $550 million and $600 million. For the year, CapEx should be between $70 million and $75 million. Corporate and other expenses are expected to be approximately $55 million. Our effective tax rate is estimated to be approximately 24%, and we expect to repurchase approximately $200 million of our shares of stock, resulting in outstanding diluted shares of $150 million at the end of 2023.\nI'll now turn the call back over to Kevin, who will provide more color on our key markets and top-line growth outlook, and segment expectations for 2023 staying on Slide 14. Kevin?\n\nKevin J. Wheeler\n\nChairman, President, & CEO, A. O. Smith Corporation\n\nThank you, Chuck. We project 2023 sales to be approximately flat to 2022 at the midpoint, with a range of plus or minus 3%, which includes the following assumptions: We view the majority of our customers exited 2022 with near-normal inventory levels. While we believe that new home construction remains a deficit, we expect it will be a headwind in 2023. Therefore, we project that 2023 residential industry unit volumes will be down approximately 2% to 5% compared to last year.\nWe project commercial water heater industry volumes to be flat to slightly up as supply chain constraints ease and the market correction related to the regulatory change in commercial electric water heaters greater than 55 gallons is largely behind us. In China, while we expect there could be COVID-19-related surges related to Chinese New Year travel, we see the recent lifting of the Zero COVID policy as a positive step to an improved economic environment.\nWe believe it will take time for the economy in China to improve amid weakened consumer confidence in a challenged real estate and housing market. We project that our sales in China will grow 3% to 5% in local currency in 2023. Our guidance assumes volumes in China improved sequentially throughout the year. Our forecast assumes that the currency translation impact on sales will be similar to 2022.\nWe expect our North America boiler sales will increase approximately 10% to 12% in 2023. Our expectations are driven by industry growth of 3% to 4%, the transition to higher energy-efficient boilers will continue, particularly as commercial buildings improve their overall carbon footprint.\nA year after launch, our CREST commercial condensing boiler with Hellcat Technology is quickly becoming the industry standard. We expect to see continued benefits from pricing actions implemented in 2022. Our boiler backlogs are at normal levels as we enter 2023. We project approximately 5% to 7% growth in sales of North America water treatment products, which is lower than our growth expectation of 10% per year, largely as a result of a reduced backlog as we exited 2022, with the pricing benefits and the megatrends of healthy and safe drinking water as well as reduction of single-use plastic bottles will continue to drive consumer demand for our products. Based on these factors, we expect our North America segment margins to be approximately 23% and Rest of World segment margins to be approximately 10%.\nPlease turn to Slide 15. We remain focused on our key strategic priorities to advance our position as a leader in heating and treating water around the world. Those priorities are: expand and enhance our high-efficiency product portfolio, including heat pumps for space and water heating; expand our global water treatment capabilities by investing in technologies, people, and distribution; deploy capital effectively by investing in ourselves, acquisitions, and returning capital to shareholders.\nAs we enter 2023, there are economic uncertainties ahead of us. However, there are positives. We believe the 2022 inventory adjustment in the wholesale residential market are behind us. We expect more normalized unit volumes in 2023. Our fourth quarter 2022 North America adjusted operating margin of 23.3% improved over previous quarters as we exit the year with a favorable price/cost relationship and our plants are running more efficiently after the third quarter volume adjustments.\nIn China, the lifting of Zero COVID policy is a positive step to an improved economic environment. In 2023, we expect a strong rebound in free cash flow as China emerges from COVID-19-related disruptions and a dedicated focus on inventory reduction across our North America operations. We remain focused on servicing our customers.\nOur strong brands across the portfolio, combined with technology-driven innovation and new product development will enhance our market leadership. We are confident in our ability to capitalize on opportunities as we continue to execute our strategy.\nWith that, we conclude our prepared remarks, and we're now available for your questions.",

Welcome to the 3M third quarter earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Tuesday, October 25, 2022.\nI would now like to turn the call over to Bruce Jermeland, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at 3M.\n\nBruce Jermeland\n\nVP of IR, 3M Company\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter earnings conference call. With me today are Mike Roman, 3M's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Monish Patolawala, our Chief Financial and Transformation Officer. Mike and Monish will make some formal comments, and then we'll take your questions.\nPlease note that today's earnings release and slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on the home page of our Investor Relations website at 3m.com.\nPlease turn to Slide 2. Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement. During today's conference call, we'll be making certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M's future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions.\nPlease note throughout today's presentation, we'll be making references to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures can be found in the appendix to these slides and in the attachments to today's press release.\nWith that, please turn to Slide 3, and I'll now hand the call off to Mike. Mike?\n\nMichael F. Roman\n\nChairman & CEO, 3M Company\n\nThank you, Bruce. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We continue to execute our strategies to deliver for our customers, position 3M for long-term growth and manage legal matters. Our team posted organic growth of 2% or more than 3%, excluding the impact of the decline in disposable respirator sales, along with adjusted margins of 21.5%, adjusted EPS of $2.69 and $1.4 billion of adjusted free cash flow.\nWhile the global economic outlook is softening, our businesses continue to innovate for customers and capitalize on opportunities. Transportation and Electronics posted 3% organic growth with Safety and Industrial, Consumer and Health Care each growing 2%. All business groups delivered margins above 21% with notable margin expansion in Safety and Industrial and Transportation and Electronics.\nLooking geographically, organic growth was led by APAC up 3%, with China up 8%, benefiting from backlog recovery following the COVID-related lockdowns in the second quarter. The Americas were up 2% with the U.S. flat against 6% growth in last year's Q3. Growth in EMEA was flat as we navigate the ongoing geopolitical unrest across Europe.\nAt the same time, we drove operational improvements to address inflation and supply chain challenges. We are delivering strong pricing, managing costs and reducing inventory backlogs while maintaining a relentless focus on serving customers. For example, we recently invested in a new shipping consolidation center in South Carolina, which is reducing average cycle times for exports to Asia by 1 to 2 weeks. Some of our actions have impacted near-term margins, but we will continue to do what is necessary to take care of customers.\nGoing forward, we see a significant opportunity to reduce cost of goods sold and working capital as global supply chains improve, which includes leveraging data and data analytics to drive productivity in our plants.\nWith respect to guidance, today, we are updating full year expectations to reflect our results through 9 months, along with the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar and ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty. For organic growth, we are lowering the high end of our range to 1.5% to 2% against the prior range of 1.5% to 3.5%.\nWe anticipate adjusted EPS of $10.10 to $10.35 against the previous expectation of $10.30 to $10.80. We are also updating our range for adjusted free cash flow conversion to 85% to 95% from 90% to 100% previously.\nTo strengthen 3M for the future, we continue to invest in growth, productivity and sustainability. For example, while we see near-term softness in consumer electronics, we are investing in electronic segments that are seeing strong growth, including new solutions for automotive displays and virtual and augmented reality. We are rolling out new thermal management solutions to improve electric car batteries, one element of our work to advance more sustainable vehicle designs. And earlier this month, we introduced a new Post-it app for Microsoft Teams that helps people collaborate in hybrid environments as we execute our digital strategy and reimagine our products.\nWe're also innovating to make our operation safer, more efficient and more productive. At our plant in Alexandria, Minnesota, we are leveraging 3M disruptive technologies to transform our abrasive belt converting process through end-to-end automation, improving labor productivity by 32%, eliminating 9 high-risk tasks and saving nearly $1 million annually. Many more similar projects are on the way across our global operations, driving safety and savings.\nIn sustainability, we have installed a new state-of-the-art water filtration system in Cordova, Illinois. We now have all 3 of our largest water-using sites in the U.S. utilizing industry-leading filtration technologies, following through on the $1 billion sustainability commitment we made last year.\nAt the same time, we are positioning 3M for long-term success by actively managing our portfolio, complementing all we do to strengthen our enterprise organically. Last month, we completed the divestiture of our Food Safety business, which unlocks value and further strengthens our balance sheet. We received approximately $1 billion and reduced our outstanding share count by 16 million.\nIn addition, earlier this month, we divested 2 of our skin care brands in Southeast Asia, enabling us to prioritize other parts of our consumer portfolio. We have also established a dedicated team to seamlessly execute our Health Care spin-off. We are confident in our plan to create 2 world-class public companies with greater focus and better able to drive growth and innovation.\nBefore turning the call to Monish, I would like to provide an update on litigation, which I know is top of mind. On Combat Arms, the Aearo Technologies chapter 11 proceeding is active and progressing. And we believe it is the best path to resolving claims in an equitable, efficient, prompt and permanent manner. That continues to be our goal, a resolution that is equitable and more certain for all parties.\nAearo is participating in a confidential mediation process focused on reaching a comprehensive settlement, and 3M is supporting those efforts. Aearo has also appealed the bankruptcy court's decision in August not to extend the stay of litigation to 3M, and the Seventh Circuit has agreed to hear the appeal. In the MDL, the next trial is scheduled for February of next year.\nWe also continue to actively manage PFAS litigation. Earlier this month, we reached a settlement with the city of Gadsden, Alabama related to carpet manufacturing. The first AFFF MDL trial is now scheduled for June of 2023.\nIn summary, we continue to deliver for customers in an uncertain environment. I thank our employees for their contributions and commitment, especially as we continue to lead through significant change and position 3M for the future. We will stay focused on driving growth, improving operational execution and delivering greater value for customers and shareholders.\nI will now turn it over to Monish for more details on the quarter. Monish?\n\nMonish D. Patolawala\n\nExecutive VP and Chief Financial & Transformation Officer, 3M Company\n\nThank you, Mike, and I wish you all a very good morning. Please turn to Slide 4. Overall, the 3M team delivered third quarter sales and operating margins that were very much in line with my comments at a conference in mid-September with some puts and takes as consumer and consumer electronics demand declined as the quarter progressed while industrial end markets demand remained steady.\nThird quarter total sales were $8.6 billion or down 3.6% year-on-year, which included headwinds of 5.1% or $450 million from foreign currency translation and 50 basis points or $50 million from the divestiture of Food Safety, along with the deconsolidation of Aearo Technologies.\nOn an organic basis, third quarter sales increased 2% versus last year. This result includes an anticipated falloff in disposable respirator demand, which negatively impacted organic sales by approximately $130 million or 1.4 percentage points. Excluding this decline, Q3 organic sales growth was 3.4%.\nOn an adjusted basis, third quarter operating income was $1.9 billion with operating margins of 21.5%, which were up 40 basis points year-on-year and 50 basis points sequentially. Adjusted earnings for the quarter were $2.69 versus $2.58 last year.\nTurning to the components that impacted third quarter operating margins and earnings year-on-year performance. As you may recall, during our Investor Day this past February, we laid out our operating framework and operating principles that included daily management, data democratization, transparency and accountability. We continue to make progress on the consistency of application of this framework.\nBy embracing these principles, along with taking self-help actions, the team executed well in the quarter as we continue to navigate the fluid and uncertain macro and geopolitical environment.\nWe continue to focus on serving our customers and drive additional actions, including: recovering our sales backlog in China from the April and May COVID-related lockdowns; implementing appropriate selling price actions to address ongoing inflation; maintaining strong spending discipline; implementing targeted productivity actions to adjust businesses to end market demand trends while driving simplification; and continuing to invest in growth, productivity and sustainability to ensure we are all well positioned for long-term success.\nThese actions helped to more than offset a number of headwinds in the quarter, including: the decline in disposable respirator sales, which negatively impacted Q3 operating margins by 30 basis points and earnings by $0.07 a share; incremental end market softness, particularly in consumer electronics, along with oral care and consumer retail in the U.S. as persistent inflationary pressures are slowing consumer spending; ongoing global supply chain challenges and raw material constraints; and finally, geopolitical impacts, particularly Russia, which was a year-on-year headwind of $50 million to revenue and $0.03 to earnings per share.\nIn total, our operating framework and self-help actions resulted in an overall net benefit to operating margins of 2.9 percentage points and $0.41 to earnings.\nMoving to raw material and logistics inflation. As I've noted over last several quarters, inflationary pressures remain persistent and are broad-based. Therefore, we continue to experience year-on-year headwinds with a Q3 cost increase of approximately $225 million or a negative impact of 2.6 percentage points to operating margins and $0.31 to earnings. Our full year raw materials and logistics inflation estimate of $750 million to $850 million remains unchanged. And as we have said before, we continue to expect to offset this through pricing actions.\nThe strength of the U.S. dollar continued to affect total revenue as foreign currency translation was a negative 5% impact. As a result, we had a benefit of 10 basis points to margins, however, incurred a headwind of $0.12 to earnings per share.\nAs Mike mentioned, we have been actively managing our portfolio. On September 1, we closed the Food Safety divestiture, resulting in approximately $1 billion in consideration received along with reducing outstanding share count by 16 million via an exchange offer.\nHowever, we lost 1 month of sales and income from Food Safety in the quarter. Therefore, the lost sales and income from Food Safety, along with the deconsolidation of Aearo Technologies, resulted in a year-on-year headwind of $0.02 to earnings per share in the quarter.\nFinally, other financial items increased earnings by net $0.15 per share year-on-year driven equally by benefits from a lower share count along with a lower-than-expected tax rate.\nThe lower third quarter adjusted tax rate was primarily the result of favorable outcomes from prior year audit settlements and geographic income mix. Looking at the full year, we now expect our adjusted tax rate in the range of 17.5% to 18.5% versus 18.5% to 19.5% previously.\nPlease turn to Slide 5. Third quarter adjusted free cash flow was $1.4 billion with conversion of 88%, an improvement from first half performance as we drive working capital intensity, including improved inventory levels, while also increasing CapEx for growth and sustainability investments. We remain focused on working capital improvement as we continue to navigate through a fluid supply chain environment.\nEven though the environment remains challenging, we are realizing benefits from our efforts as we leverage the use of data and data analytics to reduce inventory levels through better demand planning and optimized customer payment terms. We expect to continue to realize benefits from our actions as we move forward.\nCapital expenditures were $435 million in the quarter and $1.2 billion year-to-date or up 19% year-on-year as we continue to invest in growth, productivity and sustainability. Based upon the current status of supply chains and pace of projects, we now expect full year CapEx investments in the range of $1.75 billion to $1.85 billion.\nDuring the quarter, we returned $1 billion to shareholders through the combination of cash dividends of $850 million and share repurchases of $155 million. On a year-to-date basis, we returned $3.5 billion to shareholders, including $2.6 billion in dividends and $900 million in share repurchases. In addition, we reduced our outstanding share count by 16 million via an exchange offer associated with the Food Safety divestiture.\nBoth dividends and share repurchases remain important pillars of our capital allocation strategy. We continue to see the current value of the stock as a very attractive opportunity and have resumed share repurchase activity following the Food Safety divestiture.\nHaving a strong balance sheet and capital structure remains a priority for 3M because of the flexibility it provides us to continue to invest organically in the business, pursue strategic M&A opportunities and return cash to shareholders while navigating legal matters.\nNet debt at the end of Q3 stood at $12.1 billion, down 3% year-on-year and down over 30% since 2019.\nPlease turn to Slide 7 for our business group performance for Q3. I will start with our Safety and Industrial business, which posted sales of $2.9 billion or up 1.7% organically compared to last year's third quarter. This result included a year-on-year headwind of approximately $130 million due to the ongoing decline in demand for disposable respirators. Excluding disposable respirators, Safety and Industrial posted Q3 organic growth of over 6%, driven by broad-based performance along with the backlog recovery in China from the April and May COVID-related lockdowns.\nOur personal safety business declined low double digits organically primarily due to the decline in COVID-related disposable respirator demand.\nTurning to the rest of Safety and Industrial. Organic growth was led by low teen increases in both automotive aftermarket and roofing granules. Electrical markets and abrasives grew high single digits, while closure and masking systems and industrial adhesives and tapes delivered mid-single-digit growth. Operationally, the Safety and Industrial team drove strong execution during the third quarter, delivering adjusted operating income of $673 million, up 8% versus last year and up 7% sequentially versus Q2. Adjusted operating margins were 23.2%, up 2.5 percentage points as the team managed inflation with price actions, drove yield and efficiency and exercised strong spending discipline.\nThe Safety and Industrial Business Group continues to focus on investing for the future, including in digital platforms such as repair stack for connected automotive body shops and sustainable platforms like thermal barriers for auto electrification.\nMoving to Transportation and Electronics, which posted sales of $2.2 billion or up 3% organically compared to last year. Overall growth was benefited by COVID-related backlog recovery in the Greater China region, which was partially offset by increased weakness in consumer electronics demand, along with the continued constraints in the semiconductor supply chain. Our electronics-related business declined mid-single digits organically with decreases across consumer electronics, particularly smartphones, tablets and TVs. These declines were partially offset by continued strong demand for our solutions in semiconductor, factory automation and automotive end markets.\nOrganic sales in our auto OEM business were up 21% year-on-year as compared to an estimated 27% increase in car and light truck builds. As you may recall, we outperformed last year's Q3 build rate by nearly 20 percentage points as we benefit from a channel inventory build, which was unwound in Q4 last year.\nTurning to the rest of Transportation and Electronics. Commercial solutions grew organically high single digits, while advanced materials grew mid-single digits and transportation safety was down low single digits. Despite the continued fluid end market environment, the Transportation and Electronics team delivered strong operating performance. Third quarter operating income increased 9% to $474 million with operating margins of 21.2%, up 2.5 percentage points year-on-year. Operating margins were benefited by price actions as we navigated inflationary pressures along with the strong spending discipline.\nThe Transportation and Electronics business group is investing to solve some of the toughest challenges in the market and executing for future growth. For example, in Q3, we opened a new battery component testing lab to support accelerating opportunities in automotive electrification.\nLooking at our Health Care business, which delivered Q3 sales of $2.1 billion with organic growth of 1.7% versus last year's strong 8% comparison. Our medical solutions, food safety, separation and purification and Health Information Systems businesses all increased low single digits organically. While we did have organic growth in separation and purification year-on-year, biopharma was down in the U.S. due to last year's strong demand for COVID therapeutics.\nThird quarter elective medical procedure volumes were approximately 90% of pre-COVID levels as we saw activity dip in July and ramp back up as we went through the quarter. Fourth quarter procedure volumes are currently projected to be 90% to 95% of pre-COVID levels as labor shortages continue to impact the pace of recovery.\nOral care was down mid-single digits against low double-digit growth from a year ago. We are also seeing softening due to the ongoing inflationary pressures impacting consumer spending on discretionary oral care and orthodontic procedures.\nHealth Care's third quarter operating income was $452 million, down 11% year-on-year. Operating margins were 21.8%, down 1.7 percentage points with adjusted EBITDA margins of over 29%. Year-on-year operating margins were impacted by increased raw materials and logistics costs along with manufacturing productivity headwinds. These impacts were partially offset by price actions and spending discipline.\nThe Health Care Business Group is focused on delivering innovation, including investments in the launch of 3M Filtek Matrix, which creates a new and innovative approach for dental restorations, simplifying the procedure and enabling more natural tooth structure to remain. In addition, the team made capital investments to support manufacturing capacity expansions in the separation and purification and Medical Solutions business.\nLastly, our Consumer business posted third quarter sales of $1.4 billion or up 1.5% year-on-year on an organic basis versus last year's 8% comparison. Year-on-year growth in the third quarter was led by consumer health and safety, which was up mid-single digits organically, and stationery and office and home care, which both grew low single digits.\nHome improvement growth was down low single digits organically versus last year's strong comparison, however, increased mid-teens sequentially. The back-to-school season was softer than expected as consumer spending continues to be impacted by ongoing inflationary pressures, along with retailers aggressively addressing elevated inventory levels. Looking ahead, we anticipate these impacts to continue throughout the upcoming holiday season.\nConsumer's third quarter operating income was $299 million, down 3% compared to last year, with operating margins of 21.3%, down slightly year-on-year. Our Consumer business operating margins benefited from selling price actions, spending discipline and restructuring actions. These benefits were more than offset by increase in raw materials, logistics and outsourced hard goods manufacturing costs and manufacturing productivity headwinds.\nThe Consumer Business Group is executing for future growth, including expanding our Command platform to help consumers hang, organize and decorate in even more creative ways.\nPlease turn to Slide 9 for a discussion on our 2022 outlook. The macro environment remains uncertain with mixed trends and signals across geographies and end markets. While we are working through these challenges and taking actions, we are updating our full year guidance, reflecting our year-to-date performance, increasing U.S. dollar strength, along with the continued fluid environment.\nOur updated 2022 full year outlook includes: organic growth in the range of 1.5% to 2% versus a prior range of 1.5% to 3.5%; adjusted earnings in the range of $10.10 to $10.35 versus a prior range of $10.30 to $10.80, which includes an additional headwind of $0.15 per share from foreign currency exchange compared to just 3 months ago; and adjusted free cash flow conversion to be in the range of 85% to 95% versus a prior range of 90% to 100%.\nBefore I wrap up, let me make a few comments regarding the fourth quarter. First, from an end market perspective, GDP and IPI continued to moderate with current Q4 estimates of 1.4% and 2.2%, respectively. We are closely monitoring the geopolitical environment in Europe and the impact on energy inflation and end market demand.\nAuto build rates are currently estimated to be up 2% year-on-year, while consumer electronics demand is expected to remain soft. Health care elective procedure and oral care volumes are expected to be in the range of 90% to 95% of pre-COVID levels. And lastly, we anticipate continued inflationary impacts on consumer spending, along with the inventory reduction actions at retailers.\nTherefore, looking at the fourth quarter, we expect total sales to be in the range of $7.9 billion to $8.2 billion. This includes organic growth in the range of 1% to 3%, which includes a 2% headwind or $150 million to $200 million from the continued decline in disposable respirator demand; and the exit of Russia, which will create a year-on-year headwind of approximately 80 basis points or approximately $70 million. Excluding the impact from these 2 items, Q4 organic growth is estimated to be nearly 4% to 6%.\nIncreasing U.S. dollar strength is anticipated to be a year-on-year headwind of approximately 7% of sales or roughly $600 million. The divestiture of Food Safety and deconsolidation of Aearo Technologies will result in a Q4 headwind of approximately $120 million to sales or 1.5%.\nTurning to raw materials and logistics costs. We anticipate a Q4 year-on-year headwind of approximately $100 million to $150 million, which we expect to able to navigate and offset the price actions. Operating margins are expected to be in the range of 20% to 21%. And finally, our outstanding share count is currently anticipated to be in the mid-550 million share range, taking into account the 16 million share count reduction that I mentioned earlier.\nLooking ahead to 2023. While we are in the early stages of working through our plan, we see some items impacting us this year that will continue into next year while some challenges may ease. We expect the macroeconomic environment to continue to moderate while geopolitical uncertainties persist, impacting energy costs and end market demand, particularly in Europe. We are also monitoring the impact of the strong U.S. dollar along with evolving COVID-related impacts, including on government policy response, health care elective procedure volumes and disposable respirator demand.\nLooking at end markets. We expect the pace of secular industry trends to accelerate, particular in automotive, electronics, safety, digitization and sustainability. Each of these markets have tremendous opportunities for long-term growth as we continue to innovate and invest in these areas.\nRaw material, logistics and labor inflation are starting to show some signs of moderation, and we are starting to see some evidence of global supply chain stabilization. As Mike mentioned, we believe manufacturing and supply chain operations are our greatest opportunity to reduce costs and increase productivity to drive improvement in operating margin performance.\nWhile significant uncertainty is expected to remain, we are focused on serving customers and executing our operating framework and operating principles. We are prepared and will adjust as warranted and take necessary self-help actions to deliver long-term value for all our stakeholders.\nAnd finally, we are also working on ensuring we execute well on our Health Care spin to create 2 leading, world-class companies. As always, there is more we can do and will do.\nTo wrap up, I want to thank our customers and suppliers for their partnerships and the 3M employees for their hard work and dedication as they continue delivering for our customers.\nThat concludes my remarks for the third quarter. With that, we will now take your questions.",

Smith Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call.\n(Operator Instructions).\nPlease be advised that this conference may be recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Helen Gurholt. Please go ahead.\n\nHelen E. Gurholt\n\nVP of IR and Financial Planning & Analysis, A. O. Smith Corporation\n\nThank you, Josh. Good morning, and welcome to the A.O. Smith Third Quarter Conference Call. I'm Helen Gurholt, Vice President, Investor Relations and Financial Planning and Analysis. Joining me today are Kevin Wheeler, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Chuck Lauber, Chief Financial Officer.\nIn order to provide improved transparency into our operating results of our business, we provided non-GAAP measures. Free cash flow is defined as cash from operations less capital expenditures. Adjusted earnings, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted segment earnings and adjusted corporate expenses exclude the impact of nonoperating, noncash pension income and expenses as well as legal judgment income and terminated acquisition-related expenses.\nReconciliations from GAAP measures to non-GAAP measures are provided in the appendix at the end of this presentation and on our website. A friendly reminder that some of our comments and answers during this conference call will be forward-looking statements that are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include matters that we described in this morning's press release among others. Also, as a courtesy to others in the question queue, please limit yourself to 1 question and 1 follow-up per turn. If you have multiple questions, please rejoin the queue. We will be using slides as we move through today's call. You can access them on our website at investor.aosmith.com. I will now turn the call over to Kevin to begin our prepared remarks. Please turn to the next slide.\n\nKevin J. Wheeler\n\nChairman, President, & CEO, A. O. Smith Corporation\n\nThank you, Helen, and good morning. I'm on Slide 4 and our third quarter results. As we announced on October 13, we saw our customers reduce their North America residential water heater inventory levels, particularly in the wholesale distribution channel. This inventory destock activity was larger than we expected going into the third quarter. Based on market data, we believe this destock was industry-wide. As a result of the destock, our third quarter sales decreased 4% year-over-year due to lower residential water heater volumes, which more than offset our 2021 inflation-related pricing actions, incremental sales from our acquisition of Giant Industries late last year as well as commercial water heater and boiler growth in North America.\nOur Rest of World segment sales decreased 13% year-over-year as COVID-related lockdown headwinds persisted in China. Despite lower volumes, our China business achieved margin growth of 40 basis points in the quarter. The acquisition of Giant factories added $25 million in quarterly sales and $0.01 to EPS. We are pleased with the performance of the team and our integration is on track.\nWe saw quarter-over-quarter improvement in our supply chain, which led to higher commercial water heater and boiler volumes.\nPlease turn to Slide 5. Our Global A. O. Smith team delivered third quarter 2022 adjusted EPS of $0.69, a 15% decrease that was driven in part by a 4% decrease in sales compared to the third quarter of 2021 as well as higher costs associated with production inefficiency and higher cost materials. I commend the global A.O. Smith team for meeting the many challenges we faced in the third quarter. and taking the necessary steps to rightsize our production and meet current demands to improve efficiencies going forward.\nExcluding the impact of Giant, North America water heater sales decreased 9% in the third quarter of 2022. Due to greater-than-expected residential water heater destocking activity that more than offset pricing actions implemented in 2021, in response to rising material and logistic costs. The residential industry experienced greater than average growth in 2020 and in 2021. We began to see softness in our orders towards the end of the second quarter and into the third quarter. As our customers begin to destock their inventories in response to our lead times returning to pre-pandemic levels.\nHowever, this destocking activity was prolonged and deeper than we originally expected. We have seen an increase in our orders in October. And while we expect higher residential water heater volumes in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter, we do not expect volumes to be as robust as the fourth quarter of 2021. We again saw quarter-over-quarter improvements in our commercial gas water heater shipments as supply change constraints continue to ease in the third quarter. Our North America boiler sales grew 27% in the quarter, mainly driven by previously announced price increases to offset higher material and transportation costs and higher volumes.\nWe continue to see improvement in our supply chain in the third quarter, which allowed us to reduce lead times and begin to reduce our backlog. Our strategy to focus on innovation and decarbonization contributed to strong demand for our high-efficiency condensing boilers. North America water treatment sales grew over 4% in the third quarter, primarily due to pricing actions taken to offset higher input costs. Our water team business was also impacted in the quarter by customer destocking and the professional channels.\nIn line with expectations, sales in China decreased 10% in local currency compared to the third quarter of 2021, primarily due to the continued impact of COVID-19-related lockdowns. Our team in China continue to effectively manage discretionary spend in the quarter. In the fourth quarter, we forecast that consumer demand will be down approximately 15% compared to last year.\nPlease turn to Slide 6. As I mentioned on our January call, 1 of our key strategic priorities in 2022 is to innovate and expand our decarb portfolio, including heat pump technology. In the third quarter, we launched our best-in-class Voltex AL residential heat pump water heater. The Voltex AL has industry-leading energy efficiency and provides peace of mind with new integrated leak protection technology. The Voltex AL also has 0 clearance design and versatile top inside water connections to ease installation for contractors. We believe the new Voltex AL is a market-leading product that puts us in a strong position to capitalize on the decarbonization and electrification megatrends. I'll now turn the call over to Chuck, who will provide more details on our third quarter performance.\n\nCharles T. Lauber\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, A. O. Smith Corporation\n\nThank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I'm on Slide 7. Third quarter sales in the North America segment were $653 million, a 1% decrease compared with 2021. Pricing actions largely on water heaters were more than offset by lower volumes of residential water heaters. Sales in the quarter also benefited from higher volumes of commercial water heaters and boilers. Giant acquired in October 2021, added $25 million to North America sales. North America adjusted segment earnings of $133 million decreased 11% compared with the same period of 2021.\nThe earnings benefit of inflation-related price increases was more than offset by lower residential water heater volumes and related production inefficiencies as well as higher material and freight costs. Adjusted segment operating margin of 20.4% declined compared with 2021 operating margin, primarily due to the headwinds I mentioned and acquisition of Giant, which has lower margins than our overall legacy water heater business. Adjusted segment earnings and adjusted segment margin excluded a pretax gain of $11.5 million due to a judgment obtained against a competitor related to the infringement of one of our patents and pretax nonoperating pension expenses of $2.6 million. Moving to Slide 8. Rest of the World segment sales of $230 million decreased 13% year-over-year. Lower sales volumes were primarily driven by consumer demand headwinds in China related to COVID-19-related restrictions. Currency translation unfavorably impacted segment sales by approximately $16 million, $12 million of which impacted China sales.\nSales in India grew 16% in local currency in the third quarter of 2022 on strong demand for our water heating and water treating products. We view India as a long-term growth opportunity given its attractive growth characteristics and changes in demographics. Rest of the World segment earnings of $22 million decreased 19% compared to segment earnings in the third quarter of 2021.\nIn China, the impact of lower volumes was partially offset by lower selling and advertising expenses. Rest of the World segment margin of 9.5% was down 70 basis points from the same period last year primarily due to the negative effects of foreign currency translation as well as higher advertising expenses to promote new products in India, partially offset by improvement in China operating margin.\nCash flow from operations and free cash flow of $215 million and $164 million, respectively, during the first 9 months of 2022, decreased compared to the first 9 months of 2021 due to lower customer deposits in China, higher incentive accruals from 2021 due to record sales and earnings and greater cash outlays in 2022 for increased levels of safety stock on higher cost inventory that more than offset lower accounts receivable balances.\nCash flow from operations and free cash flow reported today are each $34 million higher than the preliminary cash flows reported on October 13 as a result of separately reporting the impact of foreign currency exchange impacts on working capital. Our cash balance totaled $417 million at the end of September, and our net cash position was $129 million. Our leverage ratio was 14% as measured by total debt to total capital.\nOur strong annual free cash flow and solid balance sheet allow us to continue to focus on capital allocation priorities and return cash to shareholders. Earlier this month, our Board approved a 7% increase in our quarterly dividend rate to $0.30 per share. We repurchased 4.5 million shares of common stock in the first 9 months of 2022 for a total of $282 million.\nLet's now turn to Slide 10. In addition to returning capital to shareholders, we see opportunities for organic growth, innovation and new product development across all of our product lines and geographies. The strength of our balance sheet allows us to pursue strategic acquisitions even in times of economic uncertainty. As a result of our activities to identify water heating and water treating assets that meet our financial metrics, we recognized corporate expenses of $4.3 million related to costs associated with the terminated acquisition. These costs were excluded from adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share.\nThe strength of our balance sheet allows us to maintain our strong track record of delivering returns to shareholders. This has been done through both our dividend that we have increased for 30 consecutive years as well as share repurchases that have totaled $650 million since the beginning of 2021.\nPlease turn to Slide 11 and our 2022 full year earnings guidance and outlook. We maintain our 2022 outlook that we updated in conjunction with our October 13 press release with an expected earnings per share range of $1.29 to $1.39 per share our adjusted earnings per share range of $3.05 to $3.15 per share.\nOur outlook is based on a number of key assumptions, including, no further significant surges of COVID-19 cases in the U.S. and that COVID-19-related restrictions in China remain approximately at the levels that they are today, and do not significantly impact our operations, our employees, customers or suppliers.\nSteel indices began to stabilize at the end of 2021 and have moderated through the current year. Our guidance assumes that average steel prices in the fourth quarter will be approximately 15% lower than the third quarter of this year. We continue to see elevated non-steel materials and transportation costs. We saw continued improvement in our supply chain in the quarter. However, challenges still persist. We remain in close contact with our suppliers and logistics providers to troubleshoot, manage and resolve bottlenecks, but the environment remains unpredictable.\nWe continue to see the benefit from multiple 2021 price increases, compounding to approximately 50% for water heaters. We expect to generate free cash flow of approximately $400 million to $425 million. For the year, CapEx is expected to be approximately $70 million to $75 million.\nAdjusted corporate and other expenses are expected to be approximately $55 million. Our effective tax rate is estimated to be between 23.5% to 24%. And we expect to repurchase $400 million worth of shares of our common stock, resulting in outstanding average diluted shares of $156 million for 2022. Based on these assumptions, the midpoint of our adjusted EPS range represents an increase of 5% compared to 2021.\nI'll now turn the call over -- back over to Kevin, who will provide more color on our key metrics and top line growth outlook and segment expectations for 2022, staying on Slide 11. Kevin?\n\nKevin J. Wheeler\n\nChairman, President, & CEO, A. O. Smith Corporation\n\nOkay. Thank you, Chuck. We project revenue growth for 2022 of 5% to 7%, which is lower than our outlook in July as a result of softer-than-expected demand in residential water heating. Our sales assumptions include, after approximately 8% growth in each of the last 2 years, which is well above the historical average growth rate, we estimate U.S. residential water heater industry unit volumes will be down approximately 12% to 13% on last year as customers rightsize their inventories and industry demand normalizes. We continue to project that commercial gas water heater industry shipments will be flat to slightly down for the year. However, we revised our full year outlook for the commercial water heater industry to be down approximately 15%, primarily due to continued weakness in the electric product greater than 55 gallons.\nCOVID-19-related restrictions in China played out as we expected in the quarter, and we expect continued headwinds for the remainder of the year. Therefore, we project our sales in China to be flat to slightly down in local currency compared to last year as a result of the economic headwinds we are experiencing from COVID-related restrictions.\nDue to our strong backlog and stable order rates, we maintain our full year boiler sales growth projection of 25%, driven by increased pricing in response to higher input costs and higher demand for our energy-efficient products. We project North America water treatment sales growth, inclusive of acquisitions to be approximately 10% in 2022 as we continue to execute our water treatment business strategy.\nBased on these factors, along with the full impact of our 2021 price increases, we expect North America segment margin to be approximately 21.5%, and Rest of World segment margins to be approximately 10%. Please turn to Slide 12.\nThe residential water heater industry adjustment that we experienced in the third quarter was disruptive. We have taken action to rightsize our production and we project lower steel costs, which we expect to lead to sequential improvement in profitability in the fourth quarter. Our company has a long history of equitability to navigate and innovate to all economic cycles. We believe A. O. Smith is a compelling investment with our premium brands and leading share positions in our major product categories, combined with exciting growth opportunities in North America water treatment business as well as in China and India.\nWe estimate replacement demand represents approximately 80% to 85% of U.S. water heater and boiler volumes. Our strong balance sheet and free cash flow generation allow us to continue investing for the long term in ourselves, and through acquisitions. We are focused on meeting the needs of our customers. Our portfolio of strong brands, combined with investing in technology to drive innovation and new product development, further enhance our market leadership.\nI'm confident in our ability to effectively manage the complex macro environment and capitalize on opportunities while continuing to execute our strategic objectives. That concludes our prepared remarks, and we are now available for questions.",

Welcome to the 3M Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Tuesday, July 26, 2022. I would now like to turn the call over to Bruce Jermeland, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at 3M.\n\nBruce Jermeland\n\nVP of IR, 3M Company\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter earnings conference call. With me today are Mike Roman, 3M's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Monish Patolawala, our Chief Financial and Transformation Officer; and Kevin Rhodes, our Chief Legal Affairs Officer. Please note that Mike's and Monish's formal comments this morning will be longer than past quarters given the announcements that we made this morning. (Operator Instructions)\nAlso note that today's earnings release and slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on the homepage of our Investor Relations website at 3m.com. Please turn to Slide 2. Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement. During today's conference call, we'll be making certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M's future performance and financial results.\nThese statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K and 8-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions.\nPlease note throughout today's presentation, we will be making references to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures can be found in the appendix to these slides and in the attachments to today's press release. With that, please turn to Slide 3, and I'll now hand the call off to Mike. Mike?\n\nMichael F. Roman\n\nChairman & CEO, 3M Company\n\nThank you, Bruce. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today is an exciting and important day for 3M. We are positioning our company for future success by creating more opportunity while reducing uncertainty. We plan to spin off our Health Care business, which will result in 2 world-class public companies that are global leaders with significant growth opportunities in their respective markets.\nWe intend to execute a tax-free spin-off, creating a global diversified health care technology leader. New 3M will remain a leading global material science innovator, serving customers across a range of diverse and attractive end markets. Each company will be well capitalized, more agile and focused and well positioned for long-term success.\nAlso, we are proactively taking steps to resolve litigation related to Combat Arms Earplugs. Aearo Technologies, a 3M subsidiary, has voluntarily elected to initiate chapter 11 proceedings. This process is intended to resolve claims related to Combat Arms in a manner that is efficient and equitable. 3M has not filed for chapter 11. Both 3M and Aearo expect to continue to operate in the ordinary course.\nAnd as we announced earlier in our earnings press release, 3M continues to deliver in a challenging environment, with adjusted earnings per share of $2.48 in the second quarter. We also posted organic growth of nearly 5%, excluding the impact of disposable respirators and COVID-related lockdowns in China. Monish will cover our Q2 results in detail after my remarks.\nPlease turn to Slide 4. Now is the right time for 3M to act as we position our company to win in a rapidly changing world. As I shared at our investor meeting in February, disciplined portfolio management is foundational to our growth strategy. Our Board and management team actively evaluate strategic options to drive long-term sustainable growth. The importance of portfolio management has never been greater, especially given the extraordinary macroeconomic changes brought about at the pandemic.\nI'll speak to Health Care in a moment, but let me first talk about the strong businesses that will make up New 3M. Our market-leading business groups are aligned to highly attractive end markets with tremendous opportunities in front of them. Each of these business groups grew above 8% in 2021 and are delivering solid results in a challenging environment this year.\nTogether, these businesses make up an outstanding portfolio that actively leverages our world-class capabilities. As global megatrends have accelerated, many of those trends demand our customer-driven innovations that aligned to our growth priorities. Areas such as electronics, safety, mobility, digitization, home improvement and sustainability all represent significant opportunities for 3M.\nAn important example of our strategic portfolio management is the progress we have made in Health Care. Through organic investments in innovation, strategic M&A and updates to our operating model, we have positioned Health Care to be successful as a stand-alone enterprise. In 2019, we acquired Acelity and M*Modal, establishing our leadership in Advanced Wound Care and in Health Information Systems. Also, we have divested drug delivery and are in the process of separating our Food Safety business.\nOur business group-led operating model, which we implemented in 2020, has also enabled our businesses and R&D to be closer to our customers. These actions, in addition to Health Care's strong capabilities, are why we feel now is the right time for it to formally operate as a stand-alone health care leader, especially given important trends that favor our business.\nWith shifting demographics, growing demand for virtual and in-home care, a focus on reducing rehospitalizations, advances in health care IT systems and a growing focus on delivering better patient care at a lower cost, our Health Care business is at the intersection of data, analytics and technologies needed to deliver precision medicine. Both companies will sharpen their focus to continue investing and winning in global end markets and have greater flexibility to strategically deploy capital, drive innovation and accelerate growth.\nTurning now to Slide 5. Our actions will drive long-term value for our shareholders. New 3M and Health Care will tailor their capital allocation and investments to drive innovation and growth. As leaders in their markets, their enhanced focus will help position each to respond even faster to shifting industry dynamics and needs. They will both offer distinct and compelling investment profiles appealing to different investor bases.\nThese actions will help unlock and unleash value for 3M and the Health Care business and chart an exciting course for our future. At the same time, we are also working to reduce uncertainty by efficiently and equitably resolving Combat Arms Earplug litigation. I will now provide more detail about our planned spin-off of our Health Care business and the opportunities this will create.\nPlease turn to Slide 7. Each business will be financially strong leaders in their respective industries. 3M will be an approximately $26.8 billion business and remain a leading provider of innovative solutions for a broad, diverse range of end markets, including industrial, safety, automotive, electronics and consumer. Each of these businesses benefit from 3M science and innovation.\nOur Health Care business drove $8.6 billion in sales in 2021, which includes approximately $400 million in revenue from our Food Safety business. We intend to complete the previously announced separation of the Food Safety business through a split-off transaction with a targeted closing date of September 1, 2022, subject to approval by NEOGEN shareholders in addition to other customary closing conditions. Our go-forward Health Care business will build upon strong positions in attractive markets, including wound care, oral care, health care IT and biopharma filtration. Next slide, please.\nWith our fundamental strengths in science and technology, manufacturing, global capabilities and iconic brands, we are well positioned to capitalize on and invest in key megatrends. A hallmark of 3M is our ability to leverage unique and differentiated technologies across our organization, allowing us to create new solutions required by a world where we are seeing accelerated demand for innovation and sustainability.\nWe will continue to actively manage our portfolio with discipline and focus, generate strong margins and cash flow and grow earnings by improving operating rigor. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. These include investing in organic growth, an attractive dividend, strategic M&A and finally, share repurchases. Next slide, please.\nAs we look ahead, innovation, talent and operations will remain core strengths for New 3M. We will drive more customer-focused innovation, leverage data and insights from our retail partners and connect with customers through advanced e-commerce strategies. We will share technology platforms and leverage R&D across the enterprise, which will help drive growth in all of our businesses. Attracting and retaining talented people are top priorities. We will connect them through greater flexibility with our Work Your Way model and continuously strengthen our culture of innovation.\nWe will also advance our capabilities through digitization to provide unique solutions and achieve greater end-to-end performance across our global operations. Our innovative manufacturing expertise will continue to be a differentiator and to ensure greater connectivity to customers, we will enhance our service and streamline our operating model. We are equally excited for the future of our Health Care business, which I will explain on Slide 10.\nOur Health Care business enables better, smarter and safer care, and we'll be well positioned to support customer needs and make the most of attractive opportunities, including a growing focus on infection prevention to help providers reduce related rehospitalizations, hospitals increasing investments and improvements in clinical and operational workflows to drive efficiencies and improve patient experiences, more frequent use of biologics as a first-line choice of treatment.\nIn addition, medicines are becoming more complex and advanced requiring specialized, tailored solutions. And the combination of material science and digital science, especially within oral care, is changing the patient experience for the better. With our deep and diverse portfolio of trusted brands, global capabilities, regulatory expertise and leading positions in attractive segments, we expect the Health Care business to generate strong recurring revenues, margins and cash flow. Next slide, please.\nWe are excited about the Health Care business we have built with intention and a clear focus on helping improve the health of people around the world. Our business is powered by core strengths, including our proven leadership in multiple care pathways, our position in attractive end markets, an innovation mindset, customer relationships, regulatory expertise and operational excellence. These strengths enable strong sales growth and profitability, and importantly, deliver better patient care. Next slide, please.\nWe are well positioned in large and growing health care end markets, which are expected to grow at a strong and steady rate over the next several years. Our Wound Care business is a world leader and comprises a portfolio of innovative products. Our oral care business is another leading platform, which has developed award-winning innovations.\nHealth Care Information Systems are increasingly essential as providers seek to deliver better care through comprehensive data and insights. Our biopharma filtration products are critical to manufacturing potentially life-saving medical devices, vaccines, drugs and therapeutics. Now let me turn to some of the specifics of the transaction on the next slide.\n3M plans to pursue a tax-free spin-off and retain a 19.9% stake, which we expect to monetize over time. We expect Health Care will be spun off with net leverage of 3 to 3.5x adjusted EBITDA and will delever rapidly given the business' strong cash flow. Subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, we anticipate completing this transaction by the end of 2023, and we anticipate no change in 3M's capital allocation priorities through separation.\nIn addition, 3M will retain responsibility for non-health care-related litigation, including Combat Arms Earplugs and PFAS. Over the next several months, we will begin our work to stand up these 2 companies, and we'll share updates as we progress.\nNow let me provide some additional background on Combat Arms litigation. Please turn to Slide 15. To provide some context, in 2008, 3M acquired Aearo Technologies, which manufactured Combat Arms Earplugs. Since the acquisition, Aearo has continued to operate as a wholly-owned subsidiary of 3M. These products provided effective hearing protection when used properly, and we stand by their performance. The U.S. military continues to rely on 3M products, including newer versions of the Combat Arms Earplugs.\nNonetheless, there has been an extraordinary increase in litigation related to Combat Arms. As of June 30, 2022, there were approximately 115,000 filed claims and an additional 120,000 claims on an administrative docket. The multi-district litigation process and the highly variable outcomes it has generated has not provided certainty or clarity. We believe that litigating these cases individually could take years, if not decades. We want to do right by veterans and all stakeholders, and we expect the steps we are taking today will provide greater certainty as we take action to efficiently and equitably resolve claims related to Combat Arms.\nWe have made the decision to adopt a new legal strategy. So let me provide a little more context on the actions we are taking. Aearo has voluntarily elected to use well-established chapter 11 procedures to resolve this litigation. Aearo will indemnify 3M for all liabilities related to Combat Arms and certain discontinued Aearo respirator mask products.\n3M has entered into a funding agreement and has committed to fund a trust of $1 billion to resolve all claims determined to be entitled to compensation. This amount is based on the analysis of an experienced estimator of claims in chapter 11. In addition, we are committing $240 million to cover projected case-related expenses. 3M will provide additional funding if required under the terms of the agreement.\nBy taking these actions, we expect to provide greater certainty and clarity and help funds go to plaintiffs with claims that are determined to be entitled to compensation sooner. This will help reduce the cost and time that could otherwise be required to litigate thousands of cases.\nLet me now say a few words about our plans to manage PFAS. 3M stands by our record of environmental stewardship. We are already deploying state-of-the-art technology that will help us achieve our goal of a 99% reduction in PFAS discharges from our operations. We are making progress against our goals of improving water quality, reducing water use, reducing plastic use and achieving carbon neutrality.\nIn addition, we continue to remediate at sites where 3M historically manufactured or disposed of PFOA and PFOS. Now specifically to PFAS-related litigation. We plan to vigorously defend ourselves. We are preparing our defense for upcoming milestones in the litigation process, and we are well advised of our options. Next slide.\nWe are excited about the future of 3M. Our actions today will provide greater focus for our organization. Before I turn it over to Monish, I want to reiterate a few key takeaways. Our investments in innovation, our portfolio management strategy and our realigned operating model will power our future growth. We will have dedicated teams to help facilitate focused execution of our actions announced today.\nOur planned tax-free spin-off will result in a leading global diversified health care technology company. We will create more opportunity for both 3M and the newly stand-alone Health Care business through this transaction, with 2 public companies well positioned to drive future success. In addition, we are taking action to efficiently and equitably resolve Combat Arms litigation. Finally, we remain focused on delivering in a challenging environment. Now I will turn it to Monish to provide an update on our Q2 performance and an updated outlook for the year. Monish?\n\nMonish D. Patolawala\n\nExecutive VP and Chief Financial & Transformation Officer, 3M Company\n\nThank you, Mike, and I wish you all a very good morning. Please turn to Slide 17. The 3M team executed well and delivered solid Q2 results by remaining focused on serving our customers while navigating continued supply chain challenges, inflationary pressures along with the geopolitical and COVID dynamics.\nSecond quarter total sales were $8.7 billion, which increased 1% on an organic basis versus last year's 21% comparison. Adjusted operating income was $1.8 billion, with adjusted operating margins of 21% and adjusted earnings per share of $2.48. We continue to experience strong demand across most end markets. However, a couple of items had a negative impact on overall Q2 results, which we had highlighted during the quarter.\nFirst, as forecasted, we experienced a year-on-year decline in disposable respirator sales of approximately $150 million; and second, the Greater China region's COVID-related lockdowns resulted in a sales decline of approximately $140 million year-on-year. The impact was lower than the $300 million headwind we had anticipated as the reopening of our facilities in June went better than anticipated. Our China team did a tremendous job adding additional shifts to ramp up production, distribution and drive productivity to serve our customers.\nAdjusting for these 2 impacts, organic revenue growth was nearly 5% for the rest of 3M in the quarter. Also, the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar resulted in a foreign currency translation impact of minus 4 percentage points to Q2 total sales growth. This FX impact, combined with the China COVID-related lockdowns, negatively impacted second quarter operating margins by nearly 1 percentage point and earnings by $0.24 per share versus our expectation of $0.30 as discussed during our conference in early June.\nWe also continue to support our people and manage the business and supply chain impacts from the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict. We also announced additional investments to resolve matters related to our operations in Zwijndrecht and began the process of restarting manufacturing operations, which is progressing to plan. And finally, as I will expand upon later, we are updating our full year expectations, primarily to incorporate the impact of the strong U.S. dollar, along with macroeconomic uncertainty.\nPlease turn to Slide 18, where I'll get into more details of the quarter. On this slide, you can see the components that impacted our operating margins and earnings per share performance as compared to Q2 last year. First, we continue to benefit from selling price actions, restructuring savings and strong spending discipline, which helped drive an improvement to underlying margins of 2.9 percentage points or $0.44 to earnings per share year-on-year.\nThese actions helped to more than offset headwinds, including the forecasted decline in disposable respirator demand, which negatively impacted Q2 operating margins by 40 basis points and earnings by $0.09 a share. The previously-mentioned China COVID-related lockdown, which resulted in a year-on-year headwind of 70 basis points to operating margins and $0.11 to earnings per share.\nAnd finally, as discussed during last year's second quarter earnings call, we realized a benefit to both operating margins and earnings in Q2 last year from a Brazilian Supreme Court social tax ruling, which led to a 100 basis point margin and $0.12 per share headwind to this year's second quarter. We also continue to prioritize investments in growth, productivity and sustainability to drive long-term performance and capitalize on trends in large attractive markets, including automotive, safety, health care, electronics, software and home improvement.\nMoving on to raw materials and logistics. Inflationary pressures resulted in a year-on-year headwind of nearly $270 million in the quarter or a negative impact of 3.1 percentage points to operating margins and $0.36 to earnings. Halfway through 2022, we have experienced approximately $480 million of raw materials and logistics headwinds versus our original full year expectation of $350 million to $450 million at the start of the year. We now anticipate this year full year headwind to be in the range of $750 million to $850 million, which we continue to expect to offset through pricing actions.\nAs I mentioned earlier, foreign currency translation was a negative 4 percentage point impact or a reduction of nearly $340 million in total sales and over $80 million in operating income net of hedging year-on-year. This resulted in a headwind of 10 basis points to margins and $0.13 to earnings per share. Other financial items increased earnings by a net $0.10 per share year-on-year, driven by benefits from a lower share count and tax rate.\nPlease turn to Slide 19. Second quarter adjusted free cash flow was $1 billion with conversion of 68%. Our year-on-year conversion performance was a result of a higher-than-expected increase in working capital, along with the cash impact from capitalization of R&D for U.S. tax purposes. Working capital improvement is a big piece of how we keep generating good strong cash flow for 3M.\nThe global supply chain and logistics environments remain challenging. The data analytics platform that we have created will help us to reduce inventory levels through better demand planning, SKU rationalization and use of visualization tools. We expect the benefits of these efforts to start showing up in the second half and years to come.\nCapital expenditure was $384 million in the quarter and $808 million year-to-date or up 15% year-on-year as we continue to invest in growth, productivity and sustainability. For the full year, we continue to anticipate CapEx investments in the range of $1.7 billion to $2 billion.\nDuring the quarter, we returned $848 million to shareholders through cash dividends. As we have communicated previously, share repurchases remained suspended in Q2 due to the pending Food Safety separation. We intend to complete the separation through a split-off with the closing date of September 1, subject to NEOGEN shareholder approval and other customary closing conditions. Net debt stands at $13.3 billion, up approximately 4% as we continue to invest in the business.\nPlease turn to Slide 21 for our business group performance for Q2. I will start with our Safety and Industrial business, which posted sales of $2.9 billion or up 0.7% organically compared to last year's second quarter. This result included headwinds from the decline in disposable respirator sales of approximately $150 million year-on-year, which negatively impacted Safety and Industrial's organic growth by 5.7 percentage points, along with the COVID-related lockdowns in the Greater China region.\nOur personal safety business declined high single digits organically, primarily due to the decline in COVID-related disposable respirator demand. We continue to anticipate that COVID-related disposable respirator demand will decline as we move through 2022. However, we remain prepared to respond to changes in demand as appropriate.\nTurning to the rest of Safety and Industrial. Abrasives, electrical markets and closure and masking businesses all grew low double digits organically. Roofing granules, automotive aftermarket and industrial adhesives and tapes, all delivered low single-digit organic growth.\nSafety and Industrial's second quarter adjusted operating income was $630 million, down 12% versus last year. Adjusted operating margins were 21.5%, down 2.1 percentage points. Adjusted operating margins were impacted by China lockdowns and manufacturing productivity headwinds, which were partially offset by spending discipline and benefits from restructuring actions.\nMoving to Transportation and Electronics, which posted sales of $2.3 billion, up 0.5% organically compared to last year. Organic growth was held back by the lockdowns in China, along with the ongoing impacts of the semiconductor supply chain constraints on the automotive and consumer electronics end markets. Organic sales in our auto OEM business were up low single digits versus flat global car and light truck builds as we continue to gain penetration on automotive platforms.\nOur electronics-related business declined low single digits organically with decreases across consumer electronics, particularly smartphones, tablets and TVs. These declines were partially offset by continued strong demand for our solutions in semiconductor, factory automation and automotive end markets.\nTurning to the rest of Transportation and Electronics. Advanced materials and commercial solutions grew organically mid-single digits, while transportation safety was down high single digits. Second quarter operating income was $476 million, down 7% year-on-year.\nOperating margins were 21%, down 80 basis points year-on-year. Operating margins were impacted by manufacturing productivity headwinds due to China's lockdowns and the continued shutdown during Q2 of certain operations in our Zwijndrecht factory. These impacts were partially offset by the strong spending discipline and benefits from restructuring.\nLooking at our Health Care business, which delivered strong quarter sales of $2.2 billion, with organic growth of 4.4%. Our medical solutions and oral care businesses increased low single digits organically. Second quarter U.S. elective medical procedures and oral care volume were approximately 90% to 95% of pre-COVID levels, up sequentially from Q1 levels.\nHealth Information Systems grew mid-single digits, driven by strong growth in revenue cycle management. The separation and purification business increased high single digits with sustained demand for biopharma filtration solutions for COVID-related vaccines. And finally, Food Safety was flat year-on-year.\nHealth Care's second quarter operating income was $494 million, down 10% year-on-year. Operating margins were 22.7%, down 2.6 percentage points with strong adjusted EBITDA margins of nearly 30%. Year-on-year, operating margins were impacted by manufacturing productivity, investments in the business and costs related to the Food Safety separation. These impacts were partially offset by the benefit from leverage on sales growth, strong spending discipline and benefits from restructuring actions.\nLastly, our Consumer business posted second quarter sales of $1.3 billion or down 2.5% year-on-year on an organic basis versus last year's 18% comparison. The home improvement business was down high single digits organically while consumer health and safety declined low single digits as both businesses were up against strong comparisons from a year ago. Our stationary and office business performed well, up mid-single digits year-on-year, and home care was up low single digits.\nConsumer's operating income was $247 million, down 15% compared to last year. Operating margins were 18.5%, down 2.2 percentage points year-on-year. Our Consumer business operating margins were impacted by ongoing supply chain constraints and manufacturing productivity impacts. These headwinds were partially offset by strong spending discipline and benefits from restructuring actions. Please turn to Slide 23 for a discussion on our 2022 outlook.\nAs you know, the macro environment remains uncertain with mixed trends and signals across geographies and end markets. For example, improving build rate trends in automotive; continued strong demand in semiconductor, data center and factory automation; increasing health care elective procedure volumes; and a strong bounce back in China, following April and May COVID-related lockdowns.\nHowever, there are also continued challenges and areas of concern that we are monitoring, including the stubborn and evolving impacts of COVID; global supply chain and logistics challenges; persistent and broad-based inflation, which is pressuring consumers' purchasing power and shifting spending patterns; softening trends in consumer electronics; and geopolitical uncertainties, particularly in Europe. We are working through these challenges and are taking actions such that we expect to offset the majority of these headwinds.\nHowever, as I mentioned earlier, the strength of the U.S. dollar is having an increasing impact on our top and bottom line, which is the primary factor driving our update to full year guidance. Foreign currency translation is now expected to be a full year headwind on of minus 4% versus minus 1% previously. This FX headwind is resulting in a reduction of over $1 billion in annual sales and is also accounting for nearly 80% of the adjustment in our full year earnings expectation. Therefore, we now expect full year earnings in the range of $10.30 to $10.80 versus a prior range of $10.75 to $11.25.\nGiven our first half performance, along with the continued uncertain environment, we also believe it is prudent to adjust our organic growth expectations. Therefore, we now expect full year organic growth in the range of 1.5% to 3.5% versus our prior range of 2% to 5%. And finally, we expect adjusted free cash flow conversion to be in the range of 90% to 100%.\nBefore I wrap up, let me make a few comments regarding the third quarter. First, we currently anticipate an approximate 5 percentage point headwind to total sales from foreign currency translation. While build rate forecast for automotive have moderated, we see easier comps here in Q3 versus last year. U.S. medical elective procedure volumes are expected to be in the range of 90% to 95% of pre-COVID levels, while oral care volumes are estimated at approximately 90%.\nWe expect a headwind of $100 million to $200 million year-on-year from the ongoing decline in disposable respirator demand. We continue to closely watch weakening consumer electronics demand trends and overall consumer sentiment and spending. And finally, looking at raw materials and logistics costs, we anticipate a Q3 year-on-year headwind of approximately $225 million, which we expect to be able to navigate and offset to price actions.\nTo wrap up, our team delivered 1 percentage organic sales growth in the quarter, 21% adjusted margins and generated $1 billion in adjusted free cash flow. I want to thank our customers and suppliers for their partnerships and the 3M employees for their hard work and dedication as they continue delivering for our customers.\nWhile the macro environment continues to be extremely fluid, the 3M team remains focused on serving our customers and delivering a strong second half of the year. We will remain focused on investing in favorable macro trends, increasing operating rigor through a focus on deep root cause and driving working capital intensity to further strengthen cash flow.\nI'm excited about the future of New 3M and our Health Care business. We believe that today's announcements position the company to drive significant long-term value for our customers, employees and shareholders. Our businesses and capital structure are strong, and we are well positioned for success.\nThat concludes my remarks for the second quarter. With that, we will now take your questions.",

Welcome to the A. O. Smith Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call.\n(Operator Instructions)\nPlease be advised that today's call is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Helen Gurholt. Ma'am, please go ahead.\n\nHelen E. Gurholt\n\nVP of IR and Financial Planning & Analysis, A. O. Smith Corporation\n\nGood morning, and welcome to the A.O. Smith Second Quarter Conference Call. I'm Helen Gurholt, Vice President, Investor Relations and Financial Planning and Analysis. Joining me today are Kevin Wheeler, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Chuck Lauber, Chief Financial Officer.\nIn order to provide improved transparency into the operating results of our business, we provided non-GAAP measures. Free cash flow is defined as cash from operations less capital expenditures, adjusted earnings, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted segment earnings and adjusted corporate expenses exclude the impact of nonoperating, noncash pension income and expenses.\nReconciliations from GAAP measures to non-GAAP measures are provided in the appendix at the end of this presentation and on our website. A friendly reminder that some of our comments and answers during this conference call will be forward-looking statements that are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include matters that we described in this morning's press release among others.\n(Operator Instructions)\nWe will be using slides as we move through today's call. You can access them on our website at investor.aosmith.com.\nI will now turn the call over to Kevin to begin our prepared remarks. Please turn to the next slide.\n\nKevin J. Wheeler\n\nChairman, President, & CEO, A. O. Smith Corporation\n\nThank you, Helen, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. I'm on Slide 4 and our second quarter results. Our team performed well throughout the quarter despite an uncertain macro environment to deliver strong sales and EPS performance.\nSecond quarter sales improved 12% year-over-year driven by our 2021 inflation-related pricing actions, the acquisition of Giant Factories late last year as well as water treatment, boiler and commercial water heater volume growth in North America. Our Rest of World segment performance decreased 13% year-over-year driven by COVID-19-related lockdowns in China.\nHowever, we experienced sequential sales improvement in China through the quarter as restrictions begin to ease. The acquisition of Giant Factories added $31 million to quarterly sales and $0.01 to EPS. We are pleased with the performance of the team and our integration is on track. We saw quarter-over-quarter improvement in our supply chain in the second quarter, which led to higher boiler and commercial water heater volumes.\nPlease turn to Slide 5. Our global A.O. Smith team delivered second quarter 2022 adjusted EPS of $0.82, a 14% increase that was driven in part by a 12% increase in sales compared with the second quarter of 2021. Our strong second quarter performance resulted from our team's outstanding execution despite the backdrop of an uncertain macro environment, COVID-19 related lockdowns in China and softness in the residential water heater industry. I am proud of how my A.O. Smith colleagues work together to overcome many challenges to deliver value to our customers across the globe.\nExcluding the impact of Giant, North America water heater sales grew 19% in the second quarter of 2022 due to pricing actions implemented in 2021 in response to rising material and logistics. Lower sales of residential water heaters partially offset sales growth in the quarter. The residential industry saw record orders in the second quarter of 2021 creating a difficult comparison for 2022.\nWith that said, we saw order rate softness as we exited the second quarter and into July as customers rightsize their inventories. We saw quarter-over-quarter improvement in our commercial gas water heater shipments as supply chain constraints eased in the second quarter as well as our sales of commercial electric water heaters greater to 55 gallons as order rates normalized after the regulatory change impacted orders at the beginning of the year.\nOur North America boiler sales grew 27% in the quarter driven by pricing increases to offset higher material and transportation costs and strong demand. We again ended the quarter with a significant backlog, largely composed of commercial condensing boilers. We continue to see stable order rates for these market-leading energy-efficient products.\nOur strategy to focus on innovation and decarbonization contributed to strong demand for our high-efficiency condensing boilers. North America water treatment sales grew 19% in the second quarter as our independent water quality dealers continue to outperform the market and gain share.\nWe also benefited from strong demand in the wholesale channel. In China, sales decreased 14% in local currency compared to the second quarter of 2021, primarily due to the expected impacts of COVID-19 related lockdowns. Our sales improved sequentially through the quarter as lockdowns lessen and consumer demand improved.\nThe steps that our China team have undertaken to right size of the business and manage discretionary spend paid dividends this quarter, as China held its operating margins flat to last year despite lower sales in the quarter. In the first half of July, we saw consumer demand down approximately 5% to 10% compared to last year, a sequential improvement from second quarter consumer demand levels.\nPlease turn to Slide 6. As I mentioned on our January call, one of our key strategic priorities in 2022 is to expand our water treatment business through innovation, new product development and strategic acquisitions. In May, we launched our redesigned Aquasana Clean Water machine, the first power countertop water filter to combine a sleek, compact, no-installed design with 4 different methods of advanced filtration technology.\nThe new clean water machine is tested and certified to NSF standards with a removal of up to 99.9% of 77 contaminants, including lead, the ferro chemicals such as PFOS and many more. Aquasana's patented clarity and filtration ensures industry-leading contaminant removal while retaining the beneficial and naturally occurred in minerals in water, such as calcium, magnesium and potassium for optimal hydration.\nIn addition, we welcomed Atlantic Filter Corporation to the A.O. Smith family last month. Atlantic Filter is the fifth acquisition we made in the North America water treatment market since 2016. With a strong presence in Southern Florida, Atlantic Filter will expand our capabilities in this key area of the market.\nI'll now turn the call over to Chuck, who will provide more details on our second quarter performance.\n\nCharles T. Lauber\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, A. O. Smith Corporation\n\nThank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I'm on Slide 7. Second quarter sales in the North America segment rose to $744 million, a 23% increase compared with 2021. Pricing actions largely on water heaters, represented approximately 89% of the increase.\nSales in the quarter also benefited from higher volumes of water treatment products, boilers and commercial water heaters that more than offset -- that was more than offset by lower volumes of residential water heaters. Giant acquired in October 2021, added $31 million to North America sales.\nNorth America adjusted segment earnings of $163 million increased 17% compared with the same period in 2021. The earnings benefited of inflation-related price increases was partially offset by higher material and freight costs and lower residential water heater volumes. Adjusted segment operating margin of 21.8% decline compared with the 2021, primarily due to higher material and logistic costs, plant production and efficiencies and the inclusion of Giant, which had lower margins than our legacy water heater business.\nMoving to Slide 8. Rest of the World segment sales of $230 million decreased 13% year-over-year. Lower sales volumes, primarily driven by consumer demand headwinds in China related to COVID-19-related restrictions. Currency translation of China sales unfavorably impacted sales by approximately $5 million. Sales in India grew 79% in the second quarter of 2022 on strong demand compared to last year, which was negatively impacted by the pandemic.\nWe view India as a long-term growth opportunity given its attractive growth characteristics and changes in demographics. Rest of the World segment earnings of $18 million decreased 18% compared to segment earnings in the second quarter of 2021. In China, the impact of lower volumes was partially offset by lower selling, advertising and engineering expenses. Rest of the World segment margin was 7.9%, down 60 basis points from the same period last year.\nFree cash flow of $24 million during the first half of 2022 decreased from the first half of 2021 due to higher 2022 earnings that were more than offset by lower customer deposits in China, higher incentive payments due to record 2021 sales and earnings and greater cash outlays for increased levels of safety stock and higher cost inventory.\nHistorically, we generate the majority of our cash in the second half of the year. Our cash balance totaled $459 million at the end of June, and our net cash position was $161 million. Our leverage ratio was 14% as measured by total debt to total capital.\nOur strong annual free cash flow and solid balance sheet allow us to continue to focus on capital allocation priorities and returning cash to shareholders. Earlier this month, our Board approved our next quarterly dividend of $0.28 per share. We repurchased 2.9 million shares of common stock in the first half of 2022 for a total of $190 million.\nLet's now turn to Slide 10. In addition to returning capital to shareholders, we see opportunities for organic growth, innovation and new product development across all of our product lines and geographies. The strength of our balance sheet allows us to pursue strategic acquisitions even in the event of an economic downturn.\nWe remain focused on identifying water heating and water treating assets that meet our financial metrics such as the recent acquisitions of Atlantic Filter and Giant Factories. Additionally, the strength of our balance sheet allows us to maintain a strong track record of delivering returns to shareholders. This has been done through both our dividends that we have increased for 30 consecutive years as well as share repurchases that have totaled more than $550 million since 2021.\nPlease turn to Slide 11 and our 2022 full year earnings guidance and outlook. We reaffirm our 2022 outlook with an expected EPS range of $1.56 to $1.76 per share, and our adjusted EPS range of $3.35 to $3.55 per share. Our outlook is based on a number of key assumptions, including no further significant surges of COVID-19 cases in the U.S. and that COVID-19-related restrictions in China remain approximately at the levels they are today and do not significantly impact our operations or our employees, customers or suppliers.\nSteel Indices began to stabilize at the end of 2021 and have moderated towards the end of the second quarter. Our guidance assumes that the average steel price in the second half of 2022 will approximate the average steel prices in the second half of 2021. We continue to see elevated materials and transportation costs.\nWe saw improvement in our supply chain in the second quarter, however, challenges still persist. We remain in close contact with suppliers and logistic providers to troubleshoot, manage and resolve bottlenecks but the environment remains unpredictable.\nWe continue to see the benefit from multiple 2021 price increases compounding to approximately 50% for water heaters. We expect to generate free cash flow of approximately $450 million to $500 million. The range assumes that our inventories returned to year-end 2021 levels.\nFor the year, CapEx is expected to be approximately $80 million. Corporate and other expenses are expected to be approximately $55 million. Our effective tax rate is estimated to be between 23.5% to 24%. And we expect to repurchase approximately $400 million of shares of our stock, resulting in outstanding diluted shares of $156 million at the end of 2022.\nBased on these assumptions, the midpoint of our adjusted EPS range remains an increase of 17% compared with 2021. I'll now turn the call back to Kevin, who will provide more color on our key markets and our top line growth outlook and segment expectations for 2022, although staying on Slide 11. Kevin?\n\nKevin J. Wheeler\n\nChairman, President, & CEO, A. O. Smith Corporation\n\nThank you, Chuck. We project revenue growth for 2022 of 12% to 14%, which is lower than our outlook in April as a result of softening demand in residential and commercial water heating. Our sales assumptions include: after approximately 8% growth in each of the last 2 years, which is well above the historical average growth rate.\nWe estimate U.S. residential water heater industry unit volumes will be down approximately 4% to 6% from last year as industry demand normalizes. We project that commercial gas water heater industry shipments will be flat to slightly down for the year. However, we revised our full year outlook for the commercial water heater industry to be down 7% to 9%, primarily due to weakness in the large electric greater than 55 gallons.\nThe commercial industry started the year weaker than expected, primarily due to a regulatory change that temporarily impacted orders in that product category. COVID-19-related restrictions paid out as we expected in the quarter. Therefore, we maintain our sales projection in China to be flat in local currency compared to last year. As result of the economic headwinds we are experiencing from COVID-related restrictions.\nDue to our strong backlog and stable order rates, we have increased our full year boiler sales growth projection from 18% to 20% to 25% sales growth, driven by increased pricing in response to higher input costs and higher demand for our energy-efficient products. We project North America water treatment sales growth, inclusive of acquisitions to be approximately 15% in 2022 due to strong water quality dealer performance.\nBased on these factors, along with the full impact of our 2021 price increases, we expect our North America segment margin to be between 22.5% and 23%, and Rest of World segment margins to be approximately 9.5% to 10% or 50 or 100 basis points higher than 2021.\nPlease turn to Slide 12. 2022 continues to present challenges that our global teams are meeting head on. We are 148-year old company that has continued to grow and innovate through all economic cycles. We believe A.O. Smith is a compelling investment because of our stable replacement business, combined with exciting growth opportunities in North America water treatment business as well as in China and India.\nWe have premium brands and leading share positions in our major product categories. We estimate replacement demand represents 80% to 85% of U.S. water heater and boiler volumes. The strength of our balance sheet and free cash flow generation support our ability to continue investing for the long term and automation, innovation, new products and acquisitions as well as returning cash to shareholders even in times of economic uncertainty.\nAs we have demonstrated throughout our long history, we are able to be successful in all economic cycles. We are focused on meeting the needs of our customers. Our portfolio of strong brands, combined with the investing in technology to drive innovation and new product development further enhance our market leadership. I'm confident in our ability to navigate the complex macro environment and capitalize on opportunities while continuing to execute our strategic objectives.\nWith that, we conclude our prepared remarks, and we are now available for your questions.",

Welcome to the 3M First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Tuesday, April 26, 2022.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Bruce Jermeland, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at 3M.\n\nBruce Jermeland\n\nVP of IR, 3M Company\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter earnings conference call. With me today are Mike Roman, 3M's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Monish Patolawala, our Chief Financial and Transformation Officer; and John Banovetz, our Chief Technology Officer. John is joining us today to discuss our progress on the sustainability goals that we introduced in February last year. Mike, Monish and John will make some formal comments, then we will take your questions.\nPlease note that today's earnings release and slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on the homepage of our Investor Relations website at 3m.com. Please turn to Slide 2. Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement. During today's conference call, we will be making certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M's future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions.\nPlease note, throughout today's presentation, we'll be making references to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures can be found in the attachments to today's press release.\nPlease turn to Slide 3. Before I hand the call over to Mike, I would like to take a moment and highlight a financial reporting change we are making starting here in Q1 2022. We recognize that the increases in legal-related charges that we have incurred the past couple of years have impacted investors' understanding of our underlying financial and operating performance. We have been disclosing respirator and PFAS impacts in our public filings and have decided to provide additional disclosure by expanding the scope of our non-GAAP measurement adjustments to include all impacts of accrual changes and legal fees for respirator masks, PFAS and Combat Arms matters. This change is a result of discussions we have had with many of you, along with recent benchmarking work we have done.\nThis morning, we issued a Form 8-K with updated non-GAAP financial performance history for the past 3 years. Further, we will be issuing a Form 8-K amending our most recent annual report on Form 10-K to reflect the effects of this change in our non-GAAP measures and changes in segment reporting immediately after filing our Q1 2022 Form 10-Q this afternoon. Also, our Q1 2022 financial performance and full year 2022 guidance in today's press release and presentation incorporate these changes. Please note that our guidance does not include future changes to reserves for PFAS or Combat Arms.\nHighlighted on this slide is the impact of this change to our non-GAAP financial reporting. As you can see, operating margins in 2021 were 22.2% on this new adjusted basis or up 70 basis points from pre-COVID levels in 2019 versus down 40 basis points on the previous basis. And adjusted EBITDA margins have expanded 110 basis points since 2019 to 27.6%.\nLooking specifically at our Q1 2022 performance on Slide 4, adjusted earnings were $2.65 per share. This result excludes total special items of $0.39 per share, which is comprised of $0.13 of legal related costs in the quarter, along with a $0.26 charge for PFAS-related remediation in Belgium, which we previously announced via a press release and Form 8-K filing on March 30. As we indicated in the March press release and Form 8-K filing, this charge would be reflected as an adjustment in arriving at our first quarter results adjusted for special items.\nWe remain committed to providing strong transparency in reporting our financial performance. And of course, we are always here to address your questions.\nWith that, please turn to Slide 5, and I'll now hand the call off to Mike. Mike?\n\nMichael F. Roman\n\nChairman & CEO, 3M Company\n\nThank you, Bruce. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. In a challenging global environment, 3M delivered a strong start to 2022. As Bruce just noted, to provide additional clarity on litigation-related costs and our underlying business performance, starting in the first quarter, we are reporting adjusted earnings to exclude significant litigation costs, which was $0.13 in Q1.\nAs we communicated on March 30, we also made an additional investment related to our operations in Zwijndrecht, Belgium, which resulted in a $0.26 charge. Excluding this investment, our financial outlook for 2022 remains unchanged. As you recall, at our strategic outlook meeting in February, we committed to driving growth and shareholder value in 2022 by continuing to innovate for our customers and reposition our portfolio to win in attractive markets.\nWe also committed to deliver strong margins, EPS and cash flow through a focus on operational excellence while continuing to invest in growth, productivity and sustainability. In the first quarter, we executed well and followed through on these commitments, which I will discuss on Slide 6.\nWe're relentlessly focused on serving our customers while managing supply chain disruptions, inflation and geopolitical pressures. We posted organic growth of 2%, along with sequential margin improvement, adjusted EPS of $2.65 and robust cash generation. Overall, demand is strong, though the global economic outlook has softened due to challenges in certain end markets, evolving impacts from COVID and recent geopolitical events.\nAll of our businesses started the year with good performance. End market demand was strong in Safety and Industrial, partially offset by a decline in disposable respirators. In Transportation and Electronics, our automotive business continued to outperform build rates despite the impact of semiconductor shortages. Health Care performed well with 5% growth and Consumer grew 3% in addition to 9% growth last year.\nTo position us for long-term growth, we continue to prioritize investments in high-growth opportunities across our businesses, commercial opportunities that are sizable and significant. For example, our automotive electrification platform grew 20% organically on the strength of new innovations on top of 30% growth in 2021. In Health Care, our biopharma business posted 15% organic growth as 3M Science advances the development and manufacturing of new therapeutics and vaccines. To support growing demand for our biopharma solutions, we are investing $35 million to double capacity at our plant in Columbia, Missouri.\nWe also continue to manage our portfolio and unlock value for our customers and shareholders. We are on track to close the divestiture of our food safety business in the third quarter. And in March, we divested our floor products business in Western Europe, enabling us to prioritize other parts of our Consumer business.\nIn addition, yesterday, we announced that we acquired the technology assets of LeanTec, a provider of digital inventory management solutions for the automotive aftermarket segment in the United States and Canada. It is another example of how we win in the core and build for the future, creating new platforms to access emerging trends and opportunities. In this case, the connected body shop, 1 of 3M's digital platforms that brings together data, analytics and material science. We continue to navigate global supply chain disruptions, which have been amplified by recent geopolitical unrest. We are doing whatever is necessary to take care of customers, while managing extended lead times and elevated inventory levels. At the same time, we have continued to drive strong pricing to offset inflation.\nLike many other global companies, we are actively managing through the conflict in Ukraine. Our focus remains on ensuring the safety of 3Mers in harm's way. I am proud how 3M has stepped up to help from donating nearly $4 million to employees welcoming refugees into their homes. We stand with our Ukrainian colleagues and have suspended operations in Russia. Given what we are seeing around the world, we expect supply chain challenges to persist for the foreseeable future.\nOur balance sheet remains strong, allowing us to invest in the business while returning $1.6 billion in the quarter to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases. We increased our dividend in the first quarter, marking our 64th consecutive year of increases. With respect to litigation, we are vigorously defending ourselves in Combat Arms bellwether cases. We are pleased that a jury cited with 3M in the most recent bellwether trial earlier this month, which was a plaintiff's counsel pick. To date, we have won 6 and lost 8 trials and have appealed or will appeal all adverse verdicts. Eight bellwethers were also dismissed by plaintiffs before they went to trial.\nI would also like to provide an update on operational disruptions at our factory in Zwijndrecht, which I know is top of mind. Last month, I visited Belgium to meet with local leaders and affirm our commitment to the Zwijndrecht community. As previously stated, we continue to work with Flemish authorities to address our remediation obligations and work toward greater operational certainty.\nLast September, we announced an investment of EUR 125 million to advance air and water stewardship in our existing operations, which has included the installation of a new state-of-the-art filtration system. In addition, last month, we committed EUR 150 million to remediation that addresses legacy manufacturing and disposal of PFAS on 3M site and in the surrounding area. To help reduce the impact to customers, we are supplying from other global sites and actively working to address any future potential impacts. We will continue to collaborate with officials to bring idle processes back online in Zwijndrecht, deliver essential products to our customers and follow through on our commitments. On May 11, we will publish our Global Impact Report, highlighting our progress to our sustainability commitments. In a moment, 3M's Chief Technology Officer, John Banovetz, will provide an update on an important part of these commitments, our environmental stewardship goals.\nIn summary, the first quarter was a good start to the year for 3M, and I thank all of our employees for their contributions. As I mentioned earlier, we are committed to addressing the broader challenges of supply chain disruption and litigation risk as we continue to invest in our underlying businesses, which remain strong and well positioned to grow.\nWe are maintaining our full year expectations as adjusted for the reporting change that we have discussed, which will provide greater clarity regarding our underlying performance as we navigate litigation matters. At 3M, we are driven by purpose and powered by 4 industry-leading businesses, unique global capabilities and a highly experienced and diverse team. I am confident in our ability to grow above the macro and improve our operational performance as we move through 2022.\nI will now turn it over to John Banovetz. John?\n\nJohn P. Banovetz\n\nExecutive VP, CTO & Environmental Responsibility, 3M Company\n\nThank you, Mike. And please turn to Slide 7. As a global manufacturer, 3M has a long record of environmental stewardship. Over the last 2 decades, we have reduced our greenhouse gas emissions by 75%, while more than doubling our revenue. Nearly 50% of our global electricity use is renewable, on our way to 100%. And over the last 5 years, our innovations have helped customers avoid 100 million tons of emissions. To drive our growth as a company, we will continue to build on our strong foundation, advance our strategy and invest in science-based commitments to improve the environment.\nLast year, we accelerated our leadership with a commitment to invest $1 billion and deliver our new goals around air, water and waste. As you see on the left side of the slide, our goals are meaningful, authentic and impactful to the world. They are rooted in 3M Science, applying math to a path to rapidly bend the curve on emissions. We committed to a 10% reduction in water use by 2022 and a 25% reduction by 2030. To improve water quality, we committed to install filtration technology by 2023 at our largest water using sites, and we committed to become carbon neutral with aggressive milestones along the way.\nFinally, we will reduce our use of virgin fossil-based plastic by 125 million pounds by 2025. Over the last year, we have made strong progress on each of our goals, putting us ahead of schedule in some areas and on track in all other areas. We have already cut our carbon footprint by 25% and reduced our use of water by more than 10%, which included a new closed-loop water recirculation system at our factory indicator, Alabama.\nAs Mike mentioned, we've also advanced our filtration capabilities in Zwijndrecht with a new state-of-the-art system. Part of the EUR 125 million investment we announced last September with additional work completed at several other 3M sites. Later this year, in Cordova, Illinois, for example, new filtration technologies will be fully installed including ion exchange and reverse osmosis. We've announced $165 million investment in Cottage Grove, Minnesota, which follows our decision last year to close our incinerator resulting in improved waste management while reducing energy and water usage at the site.\nIn addition, over the last year, we have reduced our use of plastic by 19 million pounds through innovative designs in our Consumer business, such as our Scotch double-sided mounting tape, which we reformulated to eliminate PVC plastic and packaging and reduce our solvent use by 300,000 pounds per year.\nIn summary, we are on track to meet or exceed each of the goals laid out last February, and we will advance our progress in 2022. This year, we expect to reduce our water usage by an additional 5%, double our reduction of virgin-based plastic and further expand our filtration capabilities across our largest water using sites.\nI'm proud of how 3Mers have come together to follow through on our commitments. Moving forward, we will continue to work with communities, customers and governments to advance our environmental stewardship and make a difference in the world. As Mike mentioned, I encourage you to read our annual Global Impact Report to be released on May 11 with more details on our priorities and progress.\nNow I will turn it to Monish, who will cover the details of the quarter. Monish?\n\nMonish D. Patolawala\n\nExecutive VP and Chief Financial & Transformation Officer, 3M Company\n\nThank you, John. And I wish you all a very good morning. Please turn to Slide 9. The 3M team delivered strong execution in Q1 in a macro environment that remains extremely fluid and increasingly uncertain. We remained focused on delivering for our customers, drove operational execution and maintained cost discipline, while also continuing to invest in the business to fuel growth. First quarter total sales were $8.8 billion, which increased 1.7% on an organic basis. As a reminder, organic sales growth does not include impacts from FX or M&A. Adjusted operating income was $1.9 billion, with adjusted operating margins of 21.4% and adjusted earnings per share of $2.65.\nOn this slide, you can see the components that impacted our operating margins and earnings per share performance as compared to Q1 last year. We continue to drive price actions, realize savings from past restructuring and maintain strong spending discipline, which helped offset both known and new headwinds. As I highlighted in my February Investor Day presentation, we made significant progress driving actions in 2021 to address rising raw material and logistics costs. We are leveraging the power of daily management, data and data analytics, along with the spirit of embracing the [red] to direct actions to offset the inflationary pressures.\nDuring last year, we developed new sourcing and pricing tools and processes to improve agility, drive alignment and simplify our processes. In addition, we are also enhancing our reporting and data analytics capabilities by rolling out tools that model price realization, leakage and elasticity. These efforts continue to pay off in Q1 as benefits from selling price actions offset raw material and logistics headwinds.\nLooking ahead, while we see raw material and logistics inflation persisting, we will continue to leverage daily management powered by data and data analytics with the expectation of offsetting raw material and logistics inflation through pricing actions in 2022. Also, during the first quarter, we completed the final actions related to our December 2020 restructuring announcement. Since Q4 2020, we have incurred total pretax restructuring charges of approximately $280 million versus an original expectation of $250 million to $300 million. These actions are expected to deliver total pretax savings of approximately $250 million are at the top end of our estimated range of $200 million to $250 million. We realized $180 million of the savings in 2021 and expect the balance of the savings of $70 million in 2022, which is incorporated in our guidance.\nIn the quarter, we experienced a year-on-year decline in disposable respirator demand of nearly $50 million, which negatively impacted operating margins by 10 basis points and earnings by $0.03 a share. On any given day, our global sourcing, manufacturing and supply chain teams continue to navigate a number of items, including raw material and logistics availability, evolving COVID-related impacts, including mandated lockdowns, employee absenteeism in our U.S. factories in January and February and now in China. The continued shutdown of certain operations in our plant in Belgium. And recently, the impacts on the geopolitical crisis in the Ukraine. These dynamics continue to result in ongoing changes to demand plans, along with increasing costs and pressuring manufacturing productivity as we work to serve our customers.\nAlso, as you will hear from me throughout the year, we continue to prioritize investments in growth, productivity and sustainability to drive long-term performance. And capitalize on trends in large, attractive markets, including automotive, home improvement, safety, health care, electronics and software.\nMoving to raw materials. We continue to experience inflationary pressures with a year-on-year increase of approximately $215 million in the quarter, which resulted in a headwind of 2.4 percentage points to margins and $0.30 per share to earnings. Foreign exchange fluctuation is something we are watching closely, particularly given the geopolitical uncertainties. During the quarter, FX was a benefit of 10 basis points to margins, however, was a negative $0.04 per share impact to earnings year-on-year, primarily the result of the strength of the U.S. dollar.\nOther financial items increased earnings by a net $0.04 per share year-on-year with benefits from a lower share count and a decline in net interest expense, more than offsetting a headwind from a higher tax rate. While year-on-year margins and earnings declined, it is also important to look sequentially given the fluid and uncertain environment. Our actions to continue to drive price to offset inflation, navigate supply chain challenges and control costs enabled us to expand adjusted margins and earnings 140 basis points and $0.20 per share, respectively.\nPlease turn to Slide 10. First quarter adjusted free cash flow was $715 million, with conversion of 47%, which was in line with our expectations. Year-on-year conversion was lower due to higher cash compensation and an increase in CapEx for growth and sustainability investments.\nLooking at the full year, our free cash flow conversion expectations of 90% to 100% remain unchanged. As you know, we currently have a very fluid environment, especially around global supply chain and logistic challenges. Therefore, we will experience some working capital ups and downs in the short run, but you should see the benefits of the power of data and analytics and operational rigor start to play out once things stabilize.\nCapital expenditures were $424 million in the quarter, up 37% year-on-year as we increase investments in growth, productivity and sustainability. For the full year, we continue to expect CapEx to be in the range of $1.7 billion to $2 billion.\nDuring the quarter, we returned $1.6 billion to shareholders through the combination of cash dividends of $852 million and share repurchases of $773 million. Our cash flow, the global economic situation and our stock price are all factors into determining the pace and amount of share repurchases. We believe our current stock price presents a good buying opportunity and we have been active in the market to start the year. While we are currently out of the market due to the pending food safety divestiture, we currently anticipate $2 billion in aggregate share repurchases over the course of the full year. Net debt stands at $13.3 billion, up approximately 2% as we continue to invest in the business.\nOur capital structure is well positioned, giving us financial flexibility and optionality. Our strong balance sheet and cash flow generation capability, along with disciplined capital allocation continues to provide us the financial flexibility to invest in our business, pursue strategic opportunities and return cash to shareholders while maintaining a strong capital structure.\nPlease turn to Slide 12 for our business group performance for Q1. I will start with our Safety and Industrial business which posted organic growth of 0.5% year-on-year in the first quarter. This result included a disposable respirator sales decline of approximately $50 million year-on-year, which negatively impacted Safety and Industrial's Q1 organic growth by 1.5 percentage points. Our personal safety business declined mid-single digits organically versus last year's 20% pandemic-driven comparison. Looking ahead, we continue to anticipate that COVID-related disposable respirator demand will decline as we move through 2022. However, if trends change, we remain prepared to respond to changes in demand as COVID impacts evolve.\nTurning to the rest of Safety and Industrial. Industrial adhesives and tapes, electrical markets, abrasives and closure and masking were all up mid-single digits compared to last year, while roofing granules and automotive aftermarket businesses were up low single digits. Safety and Industrial's first quarter adjusted operating income was $699 million, down 14% versus last year. Adjusted operating margins were 22.9%, down 3.5 percentage points. Year-on-year, adjusted operating margin performance was impacted by higher raw materials and logistics costs and manufacturing productivity headwind. Partially offsetting these impacts were selling price increases, spending discipline and benefits from restructuring actions.\nThe Safety and Industrial Business Group continues to focus on building the future through emerging trends and opportunities. Most recently, 3M acquired the technology assets of LeanTec to advance digital solutions for auto body shops. This digital platform integrates data capture and analysis with material product platforms, providing shop owners and managers more access to data for enhanced productivity and inventory management.\nMoving to Transportation and Electronics on Slide 13 which declined 0.3% on an organic basis, primarily due to the ongoing impact of semiconductor supply chain constraints on the automotive and consumer electronics end markets.\nOrganic sales in our auto OEM business were flat year-on-year versus a 5% decline in global car and light truck builds as we continue to gain penetration on automotive platforms. Our electronics-related business declined low single digits organically, with declines across consumer electronics, particularly smartphones and TVs. These declines were partially offset by continued strong demand for our products and solutions in semiconductor and factory automation end markets.\nTurning to the rest of Transportation and Electronics. Commercial solutions grew high single digits. Advanced materials was flat, while transportation safety was down mid-single digits year-on-year. First quarter operating income was $496 million, down 11% year-on-year. Operating margins were 21.2%, down 2 percentage points year-on-year. Operating margins were impacted by higher raw materials and logistics costs, manufacturing productivity impacts and investments in auto electrification. These year-on-year headwinds were partially offset by increases in selling price, strong spending discipline and benefits from restructuring actions. The Transportation and Electronics Business Group is focused on executing well against its strategic imperatives to build new growth platforms in high-growth segments, including automotive electrification, semiconductor, electronic materials and graphic and architectural films.\nTurning to our Health Care business on Slide 14 which posted a first quarter organic sales increase of 4.7% with growth across every business. Our medical solutions business increased mid-single digits organically. First quarter U.S. elective medical procedure volumes were approximately 85% to 90% of pre-COVID levels as COVID slowed the pace of procedures, particularly in January and February. Sales in our oral care business grew low single digits year-on-year. Global oral care procedure volumes dipped in January and February due to COVID but started to recover in March. Overall, patient visits for the quarter were 85% to 90% of pre-pandemic levels.\nWe continue to watch COVID-related trends and its impacts on the global health care industry, including labor shortages, which drove lower-than-expected surgical and dental procedure volumes in the quarter. The separation and purification business increased mid-single digits year-on-year with sustained demand for biopharma filtration solutions for COVID-related vaccines and therapeutics.\nHealth information systems grew mid-single digits, driven by strong growth in revenue cycle management and clinician solutions. And finally, food safety increased high single digits. As Mike mentioned, we remain on track for a Q3 close of the planned divestiture of this business, which will be combined with NEOGEN.\nHealth Care's first quarter operating income was $448 million, down 3.5% year-on-year. Operating margins were 21.1%, down 1.4 percentage points. Year-on-year operating margins were impacted by raw materials and logistics costs manufacturing productivity, investments in the business and food safety deal-related costs. These impacts were partially offset by benefit from leverage on sales growth, strong spending discipline and benefits from restructuring actions.\nDespite the current environment, the Health Care Business Group is focused on delivering clinically differentiated innovative platforms that improve patient outcomes and reduce cost of care. We have been sharply focused on 3 key segments: wound care; health care IT; and biopharma filtration. These segments are well supported by key market trends, which include: increasing chronic conditions driven by an aging population; shifting of care to lowest cost setting; improving health care access trends; and finally, digital and connected solutions.\nPlease turn to Slide 15. Lastly, our Consumer business delivered first quarter organic growth of 3.4% versus last year, with growth across every business. Our home improvement business continued to perform well, up low single digits on top of last year's growth of over 20%. This business continued to deliver strong growth with our home improvement retail customers in our category-leading Filtrete and Command brands. Stationery and office, and home care grew low single digits organically in Q1. And finally, our consumer health and safety business was up low teens year-on-year.\nConsumer's operating income was $224 million, down 17% compared to last year. Operating margin was 17.1%, down 3.7 percentage points year-on-year. Historically, Q1 is typically our lowest margin quarter of the year for our Consumer business. But this year's operating margin was further impacted by ongoing supply chain constraints, along with higher raw materials and outsourced hard goods manufacturing costs and manufacturing productivity impacts. These headwinds were partially offset by good price performance, strong spending discipline and benefits from restructuring actions. Continuing to innovate and drive sustainability within the Consumer Business Group is a top priority.\nAs consumers and businesses are increasingly shopping online, they want solutions that protect their packages and contents while making the process more convenient and sustainable than ever. As a result, we recently launched Scotch Cushion Lock, a new sustainable alternative to plastic cushion wrap and a perfect solution for protecting and packaging items with 100% recycled paper. Our Scotch portfolio is centered on innovating and serving this large and growing market.\nPlease turn to Slide 17 for a discussion on our 2022 outlook. As you know, most companies are facing a macro environment that has become even more fluid and uncertain due to several factors, including continued global supply chain and logistics challenges, ongoing impact from semiconductor constraints, particularly on the automotive and electronics industries, evolving impacts of COVID-19, growing geopolitical uncertainties, increasing foreign exchange volatility, and finally, rising inflationary pressures, including raw materials, logistics, labor and energy costs. This has resulted in softening trends impacting full year growth expectations for GDP and IPI. Both macro indices are now expected to be up approximately 3% versus up 4% at the start of the year.\nDespite the fluid and uncertain macro environment, we continue to expect organic growth in the range of 2% to 5%. Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be $10.75 to $11.25. This range incorporates the change to our adjusted earnings that Bruce highlighted at the start of the call. And finally, free cash flow conversion expectations remain in the range of 90% to 100%.\nBefore I wrap up, let me make a few comments regarding the second quarter. First, we are seeing a slow start to sales in April, primarily due to COVID-related impacts in China, along with the geopolitical crisis in the Ukraine. Raw materials and logistics costs are expected to be up, impacting Q2 year-on-year by approximately $225 million. We expect disposable respirator demand to decline both year-on-year and sequentially by approximately $100 million to $200 million.\nDuring the first quarter and particularly over the last month, growth expectations for Transportation and Electronics end markets have moderated. Second quarter global auto builds are currently forecasted to increase approximately 2% year-on-year, however, declined 3% sequentially. And smartphones are forecasted to be up approximately 1% year-on-year but declined 5% sequentially. We expect both U.S. medical and oral care elective procedure volumes in Q2 in the range of 90% to 95% of pre-COVID levels. And finally, as a reminder, last year's second quarter included an approximately $90 million operating income benefit or $0.12 per share from a Brazilian Supreme Court social tax ruling.\nTo wrap up, although we remain cautious in this current environment, we are bullish about the long term. We are committed to delivering for our customers, taking appropriate price actions, driving operational execution and managing spending while continuing strong financial rigor and maintaining a strong capital structure and financial flexibility. In the long run, we will grow [about] the macro, expand margins and deliver strong cash.\nI want to take a minute to thank the 3M employees for delivering for our customers and shareholders in a very uncertain and fluid environment. Our team delivered 1.7% organic sales growth in the quarter, 21.4% adjusted margin, up 140 basis points sequentially and generated $715 million in adjusted free cash flow.\nI also want to take a moment to personally thank our customers and suppliers for putting their trust and confidence in us and from maintaining strong and close partnership that help us navigate the current challenges. We had a good start to the year. We are watching the environment closely and working on navigating current challenges with more work to do.\nThat concludes my remarks for the first quarter. With that, we will now take your questions.",

Welcome to the first quarter 2022 earnings call. (Operator Instructions) please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions).\nI would now like to hand the conference over to Helen Gurholt. Ma'am, please go ahead.\n\nHelen E. Gurholt\n\nVP of IR and Financial Planning & Analysis, A. O. Smith Corporation\n\nThank you, Katherine. Good morning, and welcome to the A. O. Smith First Quarter Conference Call. I'm Helen Gurholt, Vice President, Investor Relations and Financial Planning and Analysis. Joining me today are Kevin Wheeler, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Chuck Lauber, Chief Financial Officer.\nIn order to provide improved transparency to our operating results, we provide non-GAAP measures. Free cash flow is defined as cash from operations less capital expenditures. Adjusted earnings, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted segment earnings and adjusted corporate expenses exclude the impact of nonoperating, noncash pension income and expenses. Reconciliations from GAAP measures to non-GAAP measures are provided in the appendix at the end of this presentation and on our website.\nA friendly reminder that some of our comments and answers during this conference call will be forward-looking statements that are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include matters that we described in this morning's press release, among others.\n(Operator Instructions). We will be using slides as we move through today's call. You can access them on our website at investor.aosmith.com.\nI will now turn the call over to Kevin to begin our prepared remarks. Please turn to the next slide.\n\nKevin J. Wheeler\n\nChairman, President, & CEO, A. O. Smith Corporation\n\nThank you, Helen, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today.\nI'm on Slide 4 and our first quarter results. Our team performed extremely well throughout the quarter, despite a turbulent macro environment, and delivered strong sales and EPS performance. First quarter sales improved 27% year-over-year, driven by our 2021 inflation-related price increases and acquisition of Giant Factories late last year and international volume growth. Excluding acquisitions, first quarter sales grew 23%.\nOur Rest of World segment performance was strong, with margins improvement over 440 basis points year-over-year, driven by China improving its operating margins to over 11%. We delivered strong results despite supply chain challenges and component shortages throughout the quarter. Weather challenges and Omicron-related labor constraints impacted our North American production in the first half of the quarter. However, shipments improved sequentially in the second half of February and in March, especially our residential water heater production, where we saw supply chain improvement and, as a result, improved our lead times to customers. The acquisition of Giant added $32 million to the quarter sales and $0.02 to EPS. We are pleased with the performance of the team, and the integration is on track.\nPlease turn to Slide 5. Our global A. O. Smith team delivered first quarter 2022 adjusted EPS of $0.77, a 31% increase that was driven in part by a 27% increase in sales compared with the first quarter of 2021. Our strong first quarter performance resulted from our team's outstanding operational and sales execution, despite the challenging environment of component shortages, continued materials and transportation cost inflation, weather impacts and surges in COVID-19. I continue to take pride in how my fellow A. O. Smith employees are working together to overcome these challenges to meet market demand and deliver for our valued customers.\nExcluding the impact of Giant, North America water heater sales grew 28% in the first quarter of 2022 due to pricing actions implemented in '21 in response to rising material and logistic costs. Our full year outlook of the residential water heater industry remains unchanged as demand continues to track to our expectations. Our full year outlook for the commercial water heater industry is to be flat to slightly down. The commercial industry started the year weaker than expected, primarily due to a regulatory change that temporarily impacted orders of large electric commercial products greater than 55 gallons.\nOur first quarter commercial sales were also impacted by component shortages for certain gas products. We have seen demand for our large electric product improving since early in the quarter, and we expect component availability to improve in the second quarter.\nOur North America boiler sales grew 24% in the quarter, primarily driven by price increases to offset higher material and transportation costs and demand for our energy-efficient products. We ended the quarter with a record backlog, largely composed of commercial condensing boilers, and April continues to generate strong order rates for these market-leading, energy-efficient boilers, providing confidence in our outlook for the year. Our strategy to focus on innovation and decarbonization contributed to strong demand for our high-efficiency condensing boilers.\nNorth America water treatment sales grew 17% in the first quarter as we continued to pursue additional market share in this attractive market with a total addressable market value that we estimate to be $2.6 billion. Taking an omnichannel approach, our strategy is to grow our market share through innovation, product development and acquisition opportunities. Our independent water quality dealers continue to play an important role in our growth by outperforming the market and gaining market share.\nIn China, sales increased 12% in local currency compared to the first quarter of 2021, primarily due to favorable mix as our new product offerings continue to be well received as well as higher sales of commercial water treatment products and replacement filters. During the first quarter, we proactively worked with our distributors to ship product into the market in advance of potential COVID-19 disruptions, which most recently is impacting transportation in certain regions.\nWhile our customers have ample inventory in place, our tracking of consumer demand in April across our portfolio and geographies is indicating a year-over-year reduction of 35% to 40%. Our outlook assumes the COVID-19-related shutdowns in China subside during the second quarter of 2022. Despite the economic headwinds to our business in China, I'm very pleased with the quarterly performance of our China team, who are taking great steps to rightsize the business, manage discretionary spend while investing in new product development.\nOn Slide 6, please. I'd like to highlight 2 of our products in China that demonstrate our continued focus on innovation and product development. At the Red-Top award ceremony in Tianjin, China, A. O. Smith earned 2 of the coveted High-End Appliance Awards for the QuietFresh Range Hood and Soft Water Heating/Hot Water Boiler. Under the guidance of China Household Electric Appliances Association, our products were among hundreds of products evaluated for the awards every year with a focus on advanced technology, industrial design, market influence, energy conservation, environmental protection and user experience. We take great pride in this recognition as yet another example of how our products set us apart as the innovative leader in the market.\nI'll now turn the call over to Chuck, who will provide more details on our first quarter performance.\n\nCharles T. Lauber\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, A. O. Smith Corporation\n\nThank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone.\nI'm on Slide 7. First quarter sales in North America segment rose to $730 million, a 32% increase compared to 2021. Pricing actions, largely on water heaters, represented approximately 89% of the increase. Sales in the quarter also benefited from higher volumes of boilers and water treatment products. However, the sales increases were partially offset by lower volumes of commercial water heaters. Giant, acquired on October 19, 2021, added $32 million to North America sales.\nNorth America adjusted segment earnings of $154 million increased 21% compared with the same period of 2021. The earnings benefit of inflation-related increases was partially offset by higher material and freight costs and lower commercial volumes.\nAdjusted segment operating margin of 21.1% declined compared with 2021. Margin performance sequentially improved each month through the quarter as COVID-19-related absenteeism and supply chain constraints eased through the quarter. North America operating margins exited the quarter at the top end of our full year margin outlook for North America.\nMoving to Slide 8. Rest of the World segment sales of $256 million increased 15% year-over-year. Favorable mix from new product introductions in the premium segment of the market, particularly our slim line electric wall hung water heaters and water treatment products that deliver hot and ambient filtered water, as well as higher sales of commercial water treatment products and water treatment filters contributed to sales gains.\nAs Kevin noted, sales in the first quarter were positively impacted by proactive measures to distribute product into the market in advance of potential COVID-19 disruptions in China. India continues to perform well, and sales grew 36% in the first quarter compared to 2021. We view India as a long-term growth opportunity given its attractive growth characteristics and changes in demographics.\nRest of the World segment earnings of $25 million increased significantly over segment earnings in the first quarter of 2021. In China, the benefits from favorable mix, higher volumes and lower advertising and selling expenses drove Rest of the World segment margin to 9.7%.\nFree cash flow of $4 million during the first quarter decreased from the first quarter of 2021 due to higher 2022 earnings that were more than offset by higher incentive payments due to record 2021 sales and earnings and higher cash outlets -- outlays for higher levels of safety stock on higher-cost inventory. Historically, we generate the majority of our cash in the second half of the year.\nOur cash balance totaled $579 million at the end of March, and our net cash position was $284 million. Our leverage ratio was 14% as measured by total debt to total capital. Our strong annual free cash flow and solid balance sheet enable us to focus on capital allocation priorities and return cash to shareholders. Earlier this month, our Board approved our next quarterly dividend of $0.28 per share, which represents our 82nd consecutive year of dividend payments. We repurchased 1.5 million shares of common stock in the first quarter for a total of $108 million.\nLet's now turn to Slide 10. In addition to returning capital to shareholders, we see opportunities for organic growth, innovation and new product development across all of our product lines and geographies. We continue to target strategic acquisitions with a focus on water heating and water treating assets that meet our financial metrics of accretive to earnings in the first year and return our cost of capital in 3 years. We have a proven track record of developing innovative new technologies and making prudent and focused acquisitions to drive shareholder value.\nPlease turn to Slide 11 and our 2022 full year earnings guidance and outlook. We reaffirm our 2022 outlook with an expected EPS range of $1.56 to $1.76 per share, and our adjusted EPS range of $3.35 to $3.55 per share. Our outlook is based on a number of key assumptions, which include no further significant surges of COVID cases in the U.S. and that COVID-related shutdowns in China subside during the second quarter of 2022 and do not significantly impact our operations, our employees, customers or suppliers.\nSteel indices began to stabilize at the end of 2021, and steel fell briefly early in the first quarter of 2022. However, due to the international uncertainty on commodities availability and prices in part due to the conflict in Ukraine, steel market prices have risen again in recent weeks. Our guidance assumes that steel pricing in 2022 on an annual basis will approximate steel market pricing as mid-April -- as of mid-April. We continue to see increases in non-materials -- non-steel materials and transportation costs.\nSupply chain challenges persisted in the first quarter. We remain in close contact with suppliers and logistic providers to troubleshoot, manage and resolve bottlenecks, but the environment remains unpredictable. Our outlook assumes we continue to see the benefit from multiple 2021 price increases and compounding to approximately 50% for water heaters and continued resiliency in demand in North America for our water heating product categories, driven by replacement demand and new construction spending.\nAs for other housekeeping assumptions, we expect to generate free cash flow of between $500 million and $525 million. For the year, CapEx should be between $75 million and $80 million. Corporate and other expenses are expected to be approximately $55 million. Our effective tax rate is estimated to be between 23.5% to 24%. And we expect to repurchase approximately $400 million worth of shares of our stock, resulting in outstanding diluted shares of $156 million at the end of 2022. Based on these assumptions, the midpoint of our adjusted EPS range represents an increase of 17% compared with 2021.\nI will now turn the call back over to Kevin, who will provide more color on our key markets and top-line growth outlook and segment expectations for 2022, all while staying on Slide 11. Kevin?\n\nKevin J. Wheeler\n\nChairman, President, & CEO, A. O. Smith Corporation\n\nAll right. Thank you, Chuck. We project revenue growth for 2022 of 14% to 16%, which is lower than our outlook in January as a result of volume headwinds in China and a slower start to commercial water heating.\nOur sales assumptions include approximately 8% growth in each of the last 2 years, which is well above the historical average growth rate, we estimate U.S. residential water heater industry unit volumes will be down approximately 2% from last year as industry demand normalizes. While the commercial water heater industry demand has started the year slower than expected, our guidance assumes improvement in the remainder of the year as we project the commercial industry volumes will be flat to slightly down compared to last year.\nWe have reduced our sales growth projection in China from 5% growth in local currency to be flat compared to last year as a result of economic headwinds we are experiencing from COVID-related restrictions.\nWe have increased our North America boiler sales growth projection from 10% to 18% to 20% sales growth, driven by increasing -- increased pricing in response to higher input costs. Our outlook for North America water treatment sales growth of 13% to 14% for 2022 has not changed.\nBased on these factors, along with the full impact of our 2021 price increases, we expect our North America segment margin to be between 22.5% and 23%, and Rest of World segment margins to be approximately 9.5% to 10% or 50 to 100 basis points higher than 2021.\nPlease turn to Slide 12. 2022 continues to present challenges for our global teams, and we are meeting them head on. We believe A. O. Smith is a compelling investment for numerous reasons. We have leading share position in our major product categories. We estimate replacement demand represents approximately 80% to 85% of U.S. water heater and boiler volumes. We have a strong premium brand in China, a broad product offering in key product categories, extensive distribution and a reputation for quality and innovation in that region.\nWe have rationalized the cost structure of our China business, streamlined our stores in Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities, and strengthened and extended our product offering in both the premium and upper mid-priced sectors of the markets we serve. We are well positioned to maximize favorable demographics in China to enhance shareholder value.\nWe continue to be very excited for the opportunity we see in our North America water treatment business. We have strong cash flow and balance sheet supporting our ability to continue to invest for the long term in automation, innovation and new products as well as acquisitions and return cash to shareholders.\nWe remain focused on serving our customers and continuing to meet their needs. Our strong brands across the portfolio, combined with investing in technology to drive innovation and new product development, will further enhance our market leadership. We are confident in our ability to capitalize on opportunities as we continue to execute our strategy.\nWith that, we conclude our prepared remarks, and we are now available for your questions.",
